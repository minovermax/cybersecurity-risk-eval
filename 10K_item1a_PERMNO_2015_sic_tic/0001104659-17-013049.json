Risk Factors\nIn addition to historical information, this report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to our financial condition, profitability, liquidity, resources, business outlook, possible acquisitions, market forces, corporate strategies, consumer preferences, contractual commitments, legal matters, capital requirements and other matters. Documents incorporated by reference into this report may also contain forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. To comply with the terms of the safe harbor, we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ substantially\nfrom the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements. When words and expressions such as: \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cobjectives,\u201d \u201cgoals,\u201d \u201caims,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201clikely\u201d or similar words or expressions are used, as well as phrases such as \u201cin our view,\u201d \u201cthere can be no assurance\u201d or \u201cthere is no way to anticipate with certainty,\u201d forward-looking statements may be involved.\nIn the section that follows below, in cautionary statements made elsewhere in this report, and in other filings we have made with the SEC, we list important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of the risk factors described below and other factors set forth in or incorporated by reference in this report.\nThese factors and cautionary statements apply to all future forward-looking statements we make. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Do not put undue reliance on forward-looking statements or project any future results based on such statements or on present or prior earnings levels.\nAdditional information concerning these, or other factors, which could cause the actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in our other SEC filings. Copies of those filings are available from us and/or the SEC.\nWe Have a Significant Amount of Indebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total outstanding debt of $25,250,000 under our credit facility. The facility is classified as a current liability as of December 31, 2016 in our consolidated balance sheets as the facility expires on September 30, 2017. We will seek to refinance or extend the maturity of this obligation prior to its expiration date; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to execute this refinancing or extension or, if we are able to refinance or extend this obligation, that the terms of such refinancing or extension would be as favorable as the terms of our existing credit facility. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This indebtedness and any future increases in our outstanding borrowings or decreases in our results of operations could:\n\u00b7 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;\n\u00b7 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u00b7 increase our costs or create difficulties in refinancing or replacing our outstanding obligations;\n\u00b7 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7 subject us to the risks that interest rates and our interest expense will increase; and\n\u00b7 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less relative debt.\nIn addition, our credit facility contains financial ratios that we are required to meet and other restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to borrow additional funds, make acquisitions, create liens on our properties and make investments. Our ability to meet these financial ratios and covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet them. If there were an event of default under our credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable.\nIn recent years, additional gaming venues have had a significant adverse effect on our visitation numbers, our revenues and our profitability.\nOur Gaming Activities Compete Directly With Other Gaming Facilities And Other Entertainment Businesses\nWe compete in local and regional markets with casinos, horse tracks and racinos, off-track betting parlors, state run lotteries, internet gambling and other forms of gaming. In a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, collegiate and professional athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel. Many of our gaming competitors are in jurisdictions with a closer proximity to large population bases and with a lower tax burden. As gambling opportunities in the region continue to proliferate, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our state or regional market share or be able to compete effectively with our competitors and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and overall profitability.\nThe introduction or expansion of gaming in neighboring jurisdictions, particularly Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania or New Jersey, the proliferation of internet gaming or the legalization of additional gaming venues in Delaware, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations. Delaware is surrounded by jurisdictions which permit slot machines and table games, such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and West Virginia.\nIn recent years, the mid-Atlantic region has experienced an unprecedented expansion in gaming venues and gaming offerings and many analysts believe that the market is showing signs of saturation, in part due to the fact that new gaming venues often result in a substantial loss of business to existing locations. This has had a significant adverse effect on our visitation numbers, our revenues and our profitability. Management has estimated that approximately 29% of our gaming win comes from Maryland patrons and approximately 60% of our Capital Club\u00ae member gaming win comes from out of state patrons.\nAll states in our geographic region have state-run lotteries. State run lotteries are no longer prohibited by federal law from offering lottery products or other gaming opportunities over the internet or through mobile applications if permitted by state law.\nSeveral states have passed legislation authorizing internet gaming and other states are pursuing or exploring the legalization of internet gaming in various forms - from fantasy sports to state run lotteries to privately run casino games, including online poker. States are aggressively seeking new revenue streams through gaming.\nAll Of Our Facilities Are In One Location\nOur gaming facilities are located adjacent to one another at a single location in Dover, Delaware. Any prolonged disruption of operations at these facilities due to damage or destruction, inclement weather, natural disaster, work stoppages or other reasons could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We maintain property and business interruption insurance to protect against certain types of disruption, but there can be no assurance that the proceeds of such insurance would be adequate to repair or rebuild our facilities or to otherwise compensate us for lost profits.\nThe Revocation, Suspension Or Modification Of Our Gaming Licenses Would Adversely Affect Our Gaming Business\nLicensing, administration and control of gaming operations in Delaware is under the Delaware State Lottery Office and Delaware\u2019s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, Division of Gaming Enforcement. Our gaming license has no expiration date and does not need to be renewed annually. However, to maintain our gaming license, we must remain licensed for harness horse racing by the Delaware Harness Racing Commission and conduct at least 80 live race days each racing season, subject to the availability of harness race horses. Our license from the Racing Commission must be renewed on an annual basis. The Racing Commission has broad discretion to reject any application for a license or suspend or revoke a license once it is issued. The Director of the Delaware State Lottery Office has broad discretion to revoke, suspend or modify the terms of our gaming license. Any modification or termination of existing licensing regulations or any revocation, suspension or modification of our licenses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and overall profitability.\nOur Gaming Activities Are Subject To Extensive Government Regulation And Any Additional Government Regulation Or Taxation Of Gaming Activities Could Substantially Reduce Our Revenue Or Profit\nWe believe that the prospect of significant additional tax revenue is one of the primary reasons why jurisdictions have legalized gaming. As a result, gaming operators are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes. These taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations and the State\u2019s share of our gaming win has been increased several times. In addition, any material increase in taxes or fees, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, may have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.\nSlot machine gaming, table games, sports betting, internet gaming, harness horse racing and pari-mutuel wagering are subject to extensive government regulation. Delaware law regulates the win we are entitled to retain and the percentage of commission we are entitled to receive from our gaming revenues, which comprises a significant portion of our overall revenues. The State granted us a license to conduct our gaming operations and a license to conduct harness horse races and pari-mutuel wagering. The laws under which these licenses are granted could be modified or repealed at any time and we could be required to terminate our gaming operations. If we are required to terminate our gaming operations or if the amount of the commission we receive from the State for conducting our gaming operations is decreased, our business operations and overall profitability would be significantly impaired.\nThe Delaware legislature has worked with the gaming industry in recent years to increase the State\u2019s gaming offerings, but it has done so while steadily increasing the State\u2019s share of the industry\u2019s gaming revenues and adding to various costs that the industry incurs to do business. In July 2008, the State\u2019s share of our gaming revenues was increased. In May 2009, an additional and significant increase in the State\u2019s share of our gaming revenues was legislated in connection with the reintroduction of limited sports betting in the State. This was the fifth increase in the State\u2019s share of gaming revenues. In January 2010, the State authorized table games, but imposed a license fee and a high tax rate on table game revenues. During this period, our revenues declined and our ability to compete with the growing number of competitors in the mid-Atlantic region was impeded. In recognition of the State\u2019s high gaming tax burden and its effect on the industry, legislators have attempted several times since 2011 to reduce this tax burden in an effort to stabilize the industry, preserve jobs and protect the State\u2019s revenue stream.\nIn June 2012, the State enacted the Delaware Gaming Competitiveness Act of 2012 (the \u201cAct\u201d), under which Delaware\u2019s video lottery agents are authorized to offer, through their websites, internet versions of their table games (including poker and bingo) and video lottery offerings. There have been discussions in Congress to regulate various forms of internet gaming and it is possible that new federal laws may preempt state laws relative to the regulation or taxation of internet gaming. Internet gaming may even be proscribed entirely by federal law much as sports betting is proscribed by federal law in all but four states.\nIn July 2013, the Delaware legislature created a Lottery & Gaming Study Commission responsible for examining the competitive marketplace confronting the Delaware gaming industry, including the business performance and business plans of existing lottery agents, the marketing efforts and investments made by Delaware video lottery agents, and the division of revenue from the video lottery, sports lottery, table games and internet gaming. The Commission\u2019s findings and recommendations were released in March 2014 and included: the State sharing certain vendor costs that the three Delaware video lottery agents currently pay associated with slot machines; reducing the State\u2019s share of table game win; and eliminating the annual table game license fee. On July 1, 2014, the legislature only enacted a vendor cost sharing recommendation and asked the Commission to reconvene to consider previous and make further recommendations relative to the gaming industry. The Commission\u2019s findings and recommendations were released in January 2015 and included: increasing the State\u2019s share of vendor costs associated with slot machines; eliminating the annual table game license fee; reducing the State\u2019s share of table game win; and providing each video lottery agent a credit of up to 5% of video lottery proceeds to be used for marketing expenditures and a credit of up to 5% of video lottery proceeds to be used for capital expenditures. Delaware State Senate Bill 30 was introduced in January 2015 in order to implement the Commission\u2019s recommendations, but it was not released from the Senate Finance Committee for action. In January 2016, Senate Bill 183 was introduced to phase in some of the Commission\u2019s recommendations over the next four years and to authorize internet sports betting in Delaware, but it was not acted upon prior to the end of the 2016 legislative session.\nWithout legislative relief, we may be unable to refinance or extend the maturity of our credit facility on favorable terms or may default on our obligations, we may be unable to allocate sufficient resources to marketing and promotions in order to compete effectively in the regional marketplace, we may be unable to allocate sufficient resources to maintaining our facility, and we may be required to take other actions in order to manage expenses - especially with respect to operations that have operated at a loss, such as table games. Such actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Laws and regulations governing the use and development of real estate may delay or complicate any improvements we choose to make and/or increase the costs of any improvements or our costs of operating.\nIf it is determined that damage to persons or property or contamination of the environment has been caused or exacerbated by the operation or conduct of our business or by pollutants, substances, contaminants or wastes used, generated or disposed of by us, or if pollutants, substances, contaminants or wastes are found on our property, we may be held liable for such damage and may be required to pay the cost of investigation and/or remediation of such contamination or any related damage.\nLaws and regulations are always subject to change, can be interpreted differently in the future, and new laws and regulations may be enacted which could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of our gaming operations. Furthermore, noncompliance with one or more of these laws and regulations could result in the imposition of substantial penalties against us or adversely affect our gaming license.\nWe Do Not Own Or Lease Our Slot Machines And Related Technology\nWe do not own or lease the slot machines or computer systems used by the State in connection with our video lottery gaming operations. The Lottery Director enters into contracts directly with the providers of the slot machines and computer systems and we are not a party to those negotiations. The State purchases or leases all equipment and the Lottery Director licenses all technology providers and we share in the expense. Similarly, but at no expense to us, the Lottery Director contracts directly with service providers for internet gaming. Our operations could be disrupted if a licensed technology provider violates its agreement with the State or ceases to be licensed for any reason. Such an event would be outside of our control and could adversely affect our gaming revenues.\nDue to Our Concentrated Stock Ownership, Stockholders May Have No Effective Voice In Our Management\nWe have elected to be treated as a \u201ccontrolled corporation\u201d as defined by New York Stock Exchange Rule 303A. We are a controlled corporation because a single person, Henry B. Tippie, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, controls in excess of fifty percent of our voting power. This means that he has the ability to determine the outcome of the election of directors at our annual meetings and to determine the outcome of many significant corporate transactions, many of which only require the approval of a majority of our voting power. Such a concentration of voting power could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us at a premium. In addition, as a controlled corporation, we are not required to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange rules.\nOur Success Depends on the Availability and Performance of Key Personnel\nOur continued success depends upon the availability and performance of our senior management team which possesses unique and extensive industry knowledge and experience. Our inability to retain and attract key employees in the future could have a negative effect on our operations and business plans.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of future developments, events or conditions. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in\nany forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, stockholders should not overly rely or attach undue weight to our forward-looking statements as an indication of our actual future results.", "PERMNO": 89332, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "DDE"}
