Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all information contained in this report before you decide to purchase our common shares. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control, including business cycles and seasonal trends of the computing, infrastructure, semiconductor and related industries and end markets. If any of the possible adverse events described below actually occurs, we may be unable to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition and operating results could be harmed. In addition, the trading price of our common shares could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSUMMARY OF FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS\nThe following summarizes the principal factors that make an investment in the Company speculative or risky. This summary should be read in conjunction with the remainder of this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the risk factors described in our public filings when evaluating our business.\n\u2022risks related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other future pandemics, on the global economy and on our customers, suppliers, employees and business;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to complete our planned merger with Inphi Corporation on a timely basis, or at all, and limitations and restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022risks related to the extension of lead time due to supply chain disruptions, component shortages that impact the production of our products, and constrained availability from other electronic suppliers impacting our customers' ability to ship their products, which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to realize anticipated synergies in connection with the Inphi merger and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022risks related to changes in general economic conditions, such as the impact of Brexit on the economy in the E.U., political conditions, such as the recent tariffs and trade restrictions with China and other foreign nations, and specific conditions in the end markets we address, including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry;\n\u2022risks related to the ability of our customers, particularly in jurisdictions such as China that may be subject to trade restrictions (including the need to obtain export licenses) to develop their own solutions or acquire fully developed solutions from third-parties;\n\u2022risks related to cancellations, rescheduling or deferrals of significant customer orders or shipments, as well as the ability of our customers to manage inventory;\n\u2022risks related to the effects of any future acquisitions, divestitures or significant investments;\n\u2022risks related to the highly competitive nature of the end markets we serve, particularly within the semiconductor and infrastructure industries;\n\u2022risks related to our dependence on a few customers for a significant portion of our revenue;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to execute on changes in strategy and realize the expected benefits from restructuring activities;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure for our manufacturing and assembly and test processes and our reliance on third parties to produce our products;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to realize anticipated synergies in connection with our acquisitions and our loss of synergies in connection with our divestitures;\n\u2022risks related to any current and future litigation and regulatory investigations that could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully maintain and grow our business;\n\u2022risks related to gain or loss of a design win or key customer;\n\u2022risks related to seasonality or volatility related to sales into the infrastructure market;\n\u2022risks related to failures to qualify our products or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing lines;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and effective manner, as well as our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology;\n\u2022risks related to failures to protect our intellectual property, particularly outside the U.S.;\n\u2022risks related to the potential impact of a significant natural disaster, including earthquakes, fires, floods and tsunamis, particularly in certain regions in which we operate or own buildings, such as Santa Clara, California, and where our third party suppliers operate, such as Taiwan and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to attract, retain and motivate a highly skilled workforce, especially managerial, engineering, sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022risks related to our debt obligations;\n\u2022risks related to severe financial hardship or bankruptcy of one or more of our major customers; and\n\u2022risks related to failures of our customers to agree to pay for NRE (non-recurring engineering) costs or failure to pay enough to cover the costs we incur in connection with NREs.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and could do so in the future. Because our results of operations are difficult to predict, you should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Due to fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and other factors, the price at which our common shares will trade is likely to continue to be highly volatile. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your common shares at or above the price you paid. In future periods, our stock price could decline if, amongst other factors, our revenue or operating results are below our estimates or the estimates or expectations of securities analysts and investors. Our stock is traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cMRVL\u201d. As a result of stock price volatility, we may be subject to securities class action litigation. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully maintain and grow our business.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMIC\nWe face risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic which currently has, and may continue in the future to, significantly disrupt and adversely impact our manufacturing, research and development, operations, sales and financial results.\nOur business has been, and will continue to be, adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to global macroeconomic effects, the COVID-19 pandemic and related adverse public health measures have caused disruption to our global operations and sales. Our third-party manufacturers, suppliers, third-party distributors, sub-contractors and customers have been, and are expected to continue to be, disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines and restrictions on their employees\u2019 ability to work; office and factory closures; disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure; border closures; and other travel or health-related restrictions. Depending on the magnitude of such effects on our manufacturing, assembling, and testing activities or the operations of our suppliers, third-party distributors, or sub-contractors, our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments will be delayed, which could adversely affect our business, operations and customer relationships.\nIn addition to operational and customer impacts, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries including an economic downturn, which has affected and may in the future affect demand for our products and impact our operating results in both the near and long term. There can be no assurance that any decreases in sales resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will be offset by increased sales in subsequent periods.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions to our business operations resulting from work from home, quarantines, self-isolations, or other movement and restrictions on the ability of our employees to perform their jobs, innovate, work together in teams and collaborate and such disruptions could impact our ability to develop and design our products in a timely manner or meet required milestones or customer commitments. See the Risk Factor entitled \u201cIf we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner, our results of operations and competitive position will be harmed.\u201d These disruptions may also impact our ability to win in time sensitive competitive bidding selection processes. See the Risk Factor entitled \u201cWe rely on our customers to design our products into their systems, and the nature of the design process requires us to incur expenses prior to customer commitments to use our products or recognizing revenues associated with those expenses which may adversely affect our financial results.\u201d In addition, work from home, quarantines, self-isolations, home schooling, continuing macroeconomic related uncertainty or caring for family members may result in heavy psychological, emotional or financial burdens for some of our employees, which may impact their productivity and morale and may lead to higher employee absences and higher attrition rates. See the Risk Factor entitled \u201cWe depend on highly skilled personnel to support our business operations. If we are unable to retain and motivate our current personnel or attract additional qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed.\u201d\nOur share repurchase program was temporarily suspended in late March 2020 to preserve cash during the COVID-19 pandemic and remains temporarily suspended in anticipation of the funding of our acquisition of Inphi. See the Risk Factor entitled \u201cThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or effect share repurchases in any particular amount or at all, and statutory requirements under Bermuda Law may require us to defer payment of declared dividends or suspend share repurchases.\u201d\nWe may become subject to claims or lawsuits by employees, customers, suppliers or other parties regarding actions we take in our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur efforts to manage these impacts may be unsuccessful, and the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration, severity and geographic scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability, widespread distribution and use of safe and effective vaccines and the actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health and economic effects. Due to the uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures and macroeconomic impacts, at this time we are unable to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be exacerbated the longer the pandemic continues.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can also exacerbate other risks discussed below in this Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" section.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PROPOSED MERGER WITH INPHI\nOur proposed acquisition of Inphi involves a number of risks, including, among others, the risk that we fail to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or at all, regulatory risks, risks associated with our use of a significant portion of our cash and our taking on significant indebtedness, other financial risks, integration risks, and risks associated with the reactions of customers, suppliers and employees.\nOn October 29, 2020, Marvell entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), by and among Marvell, Marvell Technology, Inc. (f/k/a Maui HoldCo, Inc.), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Marvell (\u201cHoldCo\u201d), Maui Acquisition Company Ltd, a Bermuda exempted company and a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo (\u201cBermuda Merger Sub\u201d), Indigo Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo (\u201cDelaware Merger Sub\u201d), and Inphi Corporation, a Delaware corporation (\u201cInphi\u201d). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement: (i) Bermuda Merger Sub will be merged with and into Marvell (the \u201cBermuda Merger\u201d), with Marvell continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo; and (ii) Delaware Merger Sub will be merged with and into Inphi (the \u201cDelaware Merger\u201d and, together with the Bermuda Merger, the \u201cMergers\u201d), with Inphi continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo. As a result of the transaction, the parent company will be domiciled in the United States upon closing of the transaction.\nOur and Inphi\u2019s obligations to consummate the proposed Mergers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among others: (i) approval by Marvell\u2019s shareholders of the Merger Agreement and the Bermuda Merger; (ii) adoption by Inphi\u2019s stockholders of the Merger Agreement; and (iii) the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. In addition to these requirements, the Merger is subject to potential delays or disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, litigation, and the ability of HoldCo and Marvell to obtain necessary financing.\nThe regulatory approvals required in connection with the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may contain materially burdensome conditions. If any conditions or changes to the structure of the proposed Mergers are required to obtain these regulatory approvals, they may have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of the proposed Mergers or reducing the anticipated benefits of the transaction to HoldCo. If we agree to any material conditions in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the proposed Mergers, HoldCo\u2019s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of the proposed Mergers will reduce HoldCo\u2019s liquidity, and may limit HoldCo\u2019s flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf the proposed Mergers are not completed by June 30, 2021 (or March 1, 2022, if extended by either party in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement) under certain circumstances, including in the event receipt of certain required regulatory approvals has not been obtained, either Marvell or Inphi may choose to terminate the Merger Agreement. Marvell or Inphi may also elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances, or they may mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the effective time of the Delaware Merger, before or after obtaining shareholder approval, as applicable.\nIf the proposed Mergers are not completed, our stock price could fall to the extent that our current price reflects an assumption that we will complete it. Furthermore, if the proposed Mergers are not completed and the Merger Agreement is terminated, we would not realize any of the expected benefits of the proposed Mergers, and we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price, including, among others:\n\u2022 we could be required to pay a termination fee of up to $460 million;\n\u2022 we will have incurred and may continue to incur costs relating to the proposed Mergers, many of which are payable by us whether or not the proposed Mergers are completed;\n\u2022 matters related to the proposed Mergers (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management team and numerous others throughout our organization, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities;\n\u2022 we may be subject to legal proceedings related to the proposed Mergers or the failure to complete the proposed Mergers;\n\u2022 the failure to complete the proposed Mergers may result in negative publicity and a negative perception of us in the investment community; and\n\u2022 any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the proposed Mergers, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, suppliers, partners or employees, may continue to intensify in the event the proposed Mergers are not consummated.\nThe benefits we expect HoldCo to realize from the proposed Mergers will depend, in part, on HoldCo\u2019s ability to integrate the businesses successfully and efficiently.\nFurthermore, uncertainties about the proposed Mergers may cause our and/or Inphi\u2019s current and prospective employees to experience uncertainty about their futures. These uncertainties may impair our and/or Inphi\u2019s ability to retain, recruit or motivate key management, engineering, technical and other personnel. Similarly, our and/or Inphi\u2019s existing or prospective customers, licensees, suppliers and/or partners may delay, defer or cease purchasing products or services from or providing products or services to us or Inphi; delay or defer other decisions concerning us or Inphi; or otherwise seek to change the terms on which they do business with us or Inphi. Any of the above could harm us and/or Inphi, and thus decrease the benefits we expect HoldCo to receive from the proposed Mergers.\nThe proposed Mergers may also result in significant charges or other liabilities, including taxes, that could adversely affect HoldCo\u2019s results of operations, such as cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges incurred in connection with the acquisition and/or integration of the business and operations of Marvell and Inphi. The amount and timing of these possible charges are not yet known. Further, HoldCo\u2019s failure to identify or accurately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities HoldCo is assuming in the proposed transaction could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting charges, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on HoldCo\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nUntil the completion of the Mergers or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, Marvell and Inphi are each prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to Marvell or Inphi and their respective shareholders.\nUntil the proposed Mergers are completed or the Merger Agreement is terminated, the Merger Agreement restricts Marvell and Inphi from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party, and requires Marvell and Inphi to conduct their respective business and operations in the ordinary course in all material respects and substantially in accordance with past practices. These restrictions may prevent Marvell and Inphi from making appropriate changes to their respective businesses or pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the proposed Mergers.\nThe Merger Agreement limits each of Marvell\u2019s and Inphi\u2019s ability to pursue alternative transactions, and in certain instances requires payment of a termination fee, which could deter a third party from proposing an alternative transaction.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that, subject to certain exceptions, limit each of Marvell\u2019s and Inphi\u2019s ability to solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate, or enter into discussions or negotiations with respect to, any inquiries regarding or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative transaction. In addition, under certain specified circumstances, Inphi is required to pay a termination fee of $300 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated and, under certain specified circumstances, Marvell is required to pay a termination fee of $400 (or in some cases $460) million if the Merger Agreement is terminated. It is possible that these or other provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Marvell or Inphi from considering or proposing an acquisition or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire Marvell or Inphi than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.\nAny delay in completing the Mergers may significantly reduce the benefits expected to be obtained from the Mergers.\nIn addition to the required regulatory clearances and approvals, the Mergers are subject to a number of other conditions that are beyond the control of Marvell and Inphi. The failure to satisfy these and other conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially and adversely affect completion of the Mergers. Marvell and Inphi cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. Further, the requirements for obtaining the required regulatory clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the Mergers for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the Mergers may significantly reduce the synergies projected to result from the Mergers and other benefits that Marvell and Inphi expect to achieve if they complete the Mergers within the expected timeframe and integrate their respective businesses.\nThere can be no assurance that Marvell will be able to secure the funds necessary to pay the cash portion of the Merger consideration and refinance certain existing indebtedness on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all.\nHoldCo intends to fund the cash portion of the Merger consideration to be paid to holders of Inphi common stock with new debt. To this end, Marvell and HoldCo have entered into a bridge commitment letter containing commitments for a $2.5 billion senior 364-day bridge loan and a term loan credit agreement containing commitments for $1.75 billion senior unsecured term loan facilities (consisting of a $875 million 3-year term loan facility and a $875 million 5-year term loan facility). There can be no assurance that Marvell or HoldCo will be able to obtain the debt financing pursuant to the bridge commitment letter or the term loan credit agreement, as applicable.\nIn the event that the debt financing contemplated by the bridge commitment letter or the term loan credit agreement, as applicable, is not available, other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. If Marvell or HoldCo is unable to obtain debt financing, the proposed Mergers may be delayed or not be completed.\nLitigation filed against Marvell and Inphi could prevent or delay the completion of the Mergers or result in the payment of damages following completion of the Mergers.\nMarvell, Inphi, and the boards of directors of both companies currently are and may in the future be parties, among others, to various litigations related to the Merger Agreement and the Merger, including putative shareholder class actions. Five lawsuits have been filed against Inphi and the Inphi Board in federal court: Wang v. Inphi Corp., et. al. (filed December 24, 2020, Northern District of California); Cohen v. Inphi Corp., et al. (filed January 5, 2021, Southern District of New York); Jones v. Inphi Corp., et al. (filed January 8, 2021, Eastern District of New York); Rosenfeld v. Inphi Corp., et al. (filed January 20, 2021, Northern District of California); and Kearny v. Inphi Corp., et al. (filed January 29, 2021, Northern District of California). Two additional federal complaints have been filed against Inphi, its board of directors, and certain Marvell entities involved in the Merger: MacIntosh v. Inphi Corp., et al. (filed December 30, 2020, Southern District of New York) and Poe v. Inphi Corp., et al. (filed January 16, 2021, District of Delaware). Three lawsuits have been filed against only Marvell and its board of directors in federal court: Raul v. Marvell Tech. Group Ltd., et al. (filed January 8, 2021, Southern District of New York); Cardone v. Marvell Tech. Group Ltd., et al. (filed January 11, 2021, Eastern District of New York); and Schumacher v. Marvell Tech. Group, Ltd., et al. (filed January 16, 2021, District of Delaware). All ten lawsuits assert claims for violation of Section 14(a) of and Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act based on allegations that the registration statement on Form S-4 filed by Marvell with the SEC on December 22, 2020 omits material information. The complaints also assert control person claims under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Marvell and Inphi boards of directors. One of the complaints that names only Inphi and its board of directors asserts an additional claim for breach of fiduciary duty. As set forth in the Merger Agreement, no settlement of litigation related to the Merger may be agreed to by Inphi without the prior written consent of Marvell.\nAmong other remedies, the plaintiffs in such matters are seeking to enjoin the Merger. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and could delay or prevent the Merger from becoming effective in a timely manner. Moreover, the pending litigation and any future additional litigation could be time consuming and expensive, could divert Marvell\u2019s and Inphi\u2019s management\u2019s attention away from their regular businesses, and, if any one of these lawsuits is adversely resolved against either Marvell or Inphi, could have a material adverse effect on Marvell\u2019s or Inphi\u2019s respective financial condition or the condition of the combined company.\nIf a settlement or other resolution is not reached in the potential lawsuits referenced above and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting Marvell\u2019s or Inphi\u2019s ability to complete the Merger on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or there is a pending or overtly threatened legal proceeding brought by a governmental party as described above, then the Merger may not become effective in a timely manner or at all.\nFailure to successfully integrate the businesses of Marvell and Inphi in the expected time frame may adversely affect HoldCo\u2019s future results.\nMarvell and Inphi entered into the Merger Agreement with the expectation that the Mergers will result in various benefits, including certain cost savings and operational efficiencies or synergies. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses of Marvell and Inphi must be successfully integrated. Historically, Marvell and Inphi have been independent companies, and they will continue to be operated as such until the completion of the Mergers. The integration may be complex and time consuming and may require substantial resources and effort. The management of HoldCo may face significant challenges in consolidating the operations of Marvell and Inphi, integrating the technologies, procedures, and policies, as well as addressing the different corporate cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel. If the companies are not successfully integrated, the anticipated benefits of the mergers may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe Change in Jurisdiction Resulting from the Mergers may impact the Rights of our Shareholders\nCurrently, the rights of Marvell shareholders arise under Bermuda law, the Marvell Memorandum of Association and the Marvell Bye-Laws. Upon completion of the Mergers, Marvell will become a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo, a Delaware corporation, and former Marvell shareholders will become HoldCo shareholders. The rights of former Marvell shareholders who become HoldCo shareholders will be governed by the HoldCo Charter and the HoldCo Bylaws, as well as U.S. federal law and Delaware law. As a result, some of the rights of HoldCo shareholders could differ from the rights Marvell shareholders currently possess. For example, the HoldCo Charter provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting any internal corporate claims, including claims in the right of HoldCo that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, employee or stockholder in such capacity, or as to which Delaware law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. The federal district courts of the United States, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will be the exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act. The exclusive forum provision does not apply to actions arising under the Exchange Act. Since Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, a state court may permit a defendant to pursue an action arising under the Securities Act in state court. While the Delaware Supreme Court has recently upheld provisions of the certificates of incorporation of other Delaware corporations that are similar to the exclusive forum provision in the HoldCo Charter, a court of a state other than the State of Delaware could decide that such provisions are not enforceable under the laws of that state. The provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with HoldCo or its directors, officers, employees or stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against HoldCo and its directors, officers, employees or stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the HoldCo Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, HoldCo may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, while class actions are generally not available to shareholders under Bermuda law, such actions are generally available under Delaware law. Thus, HoldCo may be subject to more shareholder litigation than Marvell and costly litigation could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of HoldCo.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS\nRecent, current and potential future acquisitions, strategic investments, divestitures, mergers or joint ventures may subject us to significant risks, any of which could harm our business.\nOur long-term strategy has included in the past, as discussed below, and may continue to include in the future identifying and acquiring, investing in or merging with suitable candidates on acceptable terms, or divesting of certain business lines or activities. In particular, over time, we may acquire, make investments in, or merge with providers of product offerings that complement our business or may terminate such activities.\nFor example:\n\u2022On September 19, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Aquantia Corp. (\u201cAquantia\u201d);\n\u2022On November 5, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Avera Semiconductor, the Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) business of GlobalFoundries (\u201cAvera\u201d);\n\u2022On December 6, 2019, we sold NXP USA, Inc. certain assets related to our Wi-Fi Connectivity business; and\n\u2022On October 29, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Inphi.\nMergers, acquisitions and divestitures include a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges. Any acquired business, technology, service or product could significantly underperform relative to our expectations and may not achieve the benefits we expect on a timely basis or at all. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives.\nWhen we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction.\nIf we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, these transactions, or parts of these transactions, may fail to be completed due to factors such as: failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals; disputes or litigation; or difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction.\nIf we fail to complete a transaction, we may nonetheless have incurred significant expenses in connection with such transaction. Failure to complete a pending transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative perception of us in the investment community.\nFor all these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, divestiture, merger or joint venture could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nRecent or potential future acquisitions involve a number of risks, including, among others, those associated with our use of a significant portion of our cash and other financial risks and integration risks.\nWe used a significant portion of our cash and incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of our acquisition of Cavium, which was completed in fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, we used cash and indebtedness to finance our acquisition of Aquantia and indebtedness to finance our acquisition of Avera. As of December 11, 2019, we repaid the entire amount of the indebtedness related to the Aquantia and Avera acquisitions. In addition, Marvell and HoldCo intend to fund the cash portion of the Merger consideration and other fees and expenses required to be paid in connection with the Mergers with new debt. Our use of cash to fund our current and future acquisitions has reduced our liquidity and may (i) limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and (ii) increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions. Furthermore, the Merger financing agreements contain negative covenants, limitations on indebtedness, liens, sale and leaseback transactions and mergers and other fundamental changes. Marvell\u2019s ability to comply with these negative covenants can be affected by events beyond our control. Our indebtedness and these negative covenants will also have the effect, among other things, of limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, limiting our flexibility in the conduct of our business and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions. In addition, a breach of the negative covenants could result in an event of default with respect to the indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS\nAdverse changes in the political and economic policies of the U.S. government in connection with trade with China and Chinese customers have reduced the demand for our products and damaged our business.\nRegulatory activity, such as enforcement of U.S. export control and sanctions laws, and the imposition of tariffs and export regulations, have in the past and may continue to materially limit our ability to make sales to our significant customers in China, which has in the past and may continue to harm our results of operations, reputation and financial condition. For example, the recent U.S. government export restrictions on a number of Chinese customers, such as Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., and others have dampened demand for our products, adding to the already challenging macroeconomic environment. An increasing number of Marvell products require licenses for export to Huawei and other companies on the Entity List; there can be no assurances that such licenses will be approved by the U.S. Government. Moreover, concerns that U.S. companies may not be reliable suppliers as a result of these and other actions has caused, and may in the future cause, some of our customers in China to amass large inventories of our products well in advance of need or caused some of our customers to replace our products in favor of products from other suppliers. As a result, the Chinese government has adopted a new law with respect to unreliable suppliers. Being designated as an unreliable supplier would have an adverse impact on our business and operations. In addition, there may be indirect impacts to our business that we cannot easily quantify such as the fact that some of our other customers' products which use our solutions, such as hard disk drives, may also be impacted by export restrictions. Customers in China may also choose to develop indigenous solutions, as replacements for products that are subject to U.S. export controls. Several important new restrictions became effective in December 2020 and January 2021, which may further impact our business. If export restrictions related to Chinese customers are sustained for a long period of time, or if other export restrictions were to be imposed, including restrictions on trade with other countries, it will have an adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nWe typically sell products to customers in China pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments. Customers in China can generally cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a penalty and, therefore, they may be more likely to do so while the tariffs and trade restrictions are in effect. See also, risk Factor entitled \u201cWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our gross margin. Conversely, we may have insufficient inventory, which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potential loss of market share as well as damaged customer relationships.\u201d In addition, customers in China that may be subject to trade restrictions or tariffs, may develop their own products or solutions instead of purchasing from us or they may acquire products or solutions from our competitors or other third-party sources that are not subject to the U.S. tariffs and trade restrictions.\nChanges to U.S. or foreign tax, trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign international tax, social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business. The prior U.S. presidential administration instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that included the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. Any new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods. The prior U.S. presidential administration also focused on policy reforms that discouraged corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S., which required us to change the way we conduct business. The new U.S. presidential administration\u2019s policies are not fully understood but seem likely to include some changes to the status quo, which may cause damage to our business. Political changes and trends such as populism, protectionism, economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational companies and resulting changes to trade, tax or other laws and policies may be disruptive to our businesses. These changes in U.S. and foreign laws and policies have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also, \u201cAdverse changes in the political and economic policies of the U.S. government in connection with trade with China have reduced the demand for our products and damaged our business\u201d and \"Changes in existing taxation benefits, rules or practices may adversely affect our financial results.\u201d\nWe face additional risks due to the extent of our global operations since a majority of our products, and those of our customers, are manufactured and sold outside of the United States. The occurrence of any or a combination of the additional risks described below would significantly and negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the United States and, as a result, we are subject to foreign business, political and economic risks. Most of our products are manufactured outside of the United States. Our current qualified integrated circuit foundries are located in the same region within Taiwan. In addition, our primary assembly and test subcontractors are located in the Pacific Rim region. As a result, disruptions affecting the operations of our suppliers in Taiwan, whether political, military or natural disasters will adversely impact our business. In addition, many of our customers are located outside of the United States, primarily in Asia, which further exposes us to foreign risks. Sales shipped to customers with operations in Asia represented approximately 80% and 82% of our net revenue in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.\nWe also have substantial operations outside of the United States. These operations are directly influenced by the political and economic conditions of the region in which they are located and, with respect to Israel, possible military hostilities periodically affecting the region that could affect our operations there. We anticipate that our manufacturing, assembly, testing and sales outside of the United States will continue to account for a substantial portion of our operations and revenue in future periods.\nAccordingly, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including:\n\u2022the rise or spread of global pandemics or actual or threatened public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, employees, customers and suppliers;\n\u2022political, social and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions;\n\u2022volatile global economic conditions, including downturns in which some competitors may become more aggressive in their pricing practices, which would adversely impact our gross margin;\n\u2022compliance with domestic and foreign export and import regulations, including pending changes thereto, and difficulties in obtaining and complying with domestic and foreign export, import and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022local laws and practices that favor local companies, including business practices in which we are prohibited from engaging by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022natural disasters, including earthquakes, fires, tsunamis and floods;\n\u2022trade restrictions, higher tariffs, worsening trade relationship between the United States and China, or changes in cross border taxation, particularly in light of the tariffs imposed by the prior U.S. presidential administration;\n\u2022transportation delays;\n\u2022difficulties of managing distributors;\n\u2022less effective protection of intellectual property than is afforded to us in the United States or other developed countries;\n\u2022inadequate local infrastructure; and\n\u2022exposure to local banking, currency control and other financial-related risks.\nAs a result of having global operations, the sudden disruption of the supply chain and/or disruption of the manufacture of our customer\u2019s products caused by events outside of our control could impact our results of operations by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products.\nMoreover, the international nature of our business subjects us to risk associated with the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus currencies in jurisdictions where we have large fixed costs, or where our third-party manufacturers have significant costs, will increase the cost of such operations which could harm our results of operations.\nWE ARE VULNERABLE TO PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING-RELATED RISKS\nWe rely on independent foundries and subcontractors for the manufacture, assembly and testing of our integrated circuit products, and the failure of any of these third-party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested or to be able to fulfill our orders could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our ability to grow our business.\nWe do not have our own manufacturing or assembly facilities and have very limited in-house testing facilities. Therefore, we currently rely on several third-party foundries to produce our integrated circuit products. We also currently rely on several third-party assembly and test subcontractors to assemble, package and test our products. This exposes us to a variety of risks, including the following:\nRegional Concentration\nSubstantially all of our products are manufactured by third-party foundries located in Taiwan, and other sources are located in China, Germany, South Korea, Singapore and the United States. In addition, substantially all of our third-party assembly and testing facilities are located in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. Because of the geographic concentration of these third-party foundries, as well as our assembly and test subcontractors, we are exposed to the risk that their operations may be disrupted by regional disasters including, for example, earthquakes (particularly in Taiwan and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim close to fault lines), tsunamis or typhoons, or by pandemics or other actual or threatened public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or by political, social or economic instability. In the case of such an event, our revenue, cost of goods sold and results of operations would be negatively impacted. In addition, there are limited numbers of alternative foundries and identifying and implementing alternative manufacturing facilities would be time consuming. As a result, if we needed to implement alternate manufacturing facilities, we could experience significant expenses and delays in product shipments, which could harm our results of operations.\nNo Guarantee of Capacity or Supply\nThe ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations. When demand is strong, availability of foundry capacity may be constrained or not available, and with limited exceptions, our vendors are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantities, or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. We place our orders on the basis of our customers\u2019 purchase orders or our forecast of customer demand, and the foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies\u2019 products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice. It is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are or that have long-term agreements with our main foundries may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to those customers. Our foundries and outsourced assembly and test suppliers may reallocate capacity to their customers offering them a better margin or rate of return than provided by the Company. This reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need. In particular, as we and others in our industry transition to smaller geometries, our manufacturing partners may be supply constrained or may charge premiums for these advanced technologies, which may harm our business or results of operations. See also, \u201cWe may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration, which may result in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses.\u201d Moreover, if any of our third-party foundry suppliers, outsourced assembly and test suppliers, or other suppliers are unable to secure the necessary raw materials from their suppliers, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions, which could harm our business or results of operations.\nFor example, in response to growth in demand from customers for our products, our operations team is continuing to ramp production with our global supply chain partners. However, we have in the past, and may in the future, experience a number of industry-wide supply constraints affecting the type of high complexity products we provide for data infrastructure. These supply challenges have in the past, and may in the future, limit our ability to fully satisfy the increase in demand for some of our networking products.\nWhile we attempt to create multiple sources for our products, most of our products are not manufactured at more than one foundry at any given time, and our products typically are designed to be manufactured in a specific process at only one of these foundries. Accordingly, if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed, it would be difficult for us to transition the manufacture of our products to other foundries, and we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components. This could result in a material decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow.\nIn order to secure sufficient foundry capacity when demand is high and to mitigate the risks described in the foregoing paragraph, we may enter into various arrangements with our foundries, outsourced assembly and test suppliers, or other suppliers that could be costly and harm our results of operations, such as nonrefundable deposits with or loans to such parties in exchange for capacity commitments, or contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of integrated circuits over extended periods. We may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all, and any arrangements may be costly, reduce our financial flexibility, and not be on terms favorable to us. Moreover, if we are able to secure foundry capacity, we may be obligated to use all of that capacity or incur penalties. These penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results.\nRecent supply shortages in the semiconductor industry of multi-layer complex substrates, IC packaging capacity and fab constraints have resulted in increased lead times, inability to meet demand, and increased costs during 2020, and these supply constraints are currently expected to continue throughout 2021.\nUncertain Yields and Quality\nThe fabrication of integrated circuits is a complex and technically demanding process. Our technology is transitioning from planar to FINFET transistors. This transition may result in longer qualification cycles and lower yields. Our foundries have from time to time experienced manufacturing defects and lower manufacturing yields, which are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct. Changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by our foundries could result in lower than anticipated manufacturing yields or unacceptable performance. In addition, we may face lower manufacturing yields and reduced quality in the process of ramping up and diversifying our manufacturing partners. Poor yields from our foundries, or defects, integration issues or other performance problems with our products could cause us significant customer relations and business reputation problems, harm our financial performance and result in financial or other damages to our customers. Our customers could also seek damages in connection with product liability claims, which would likely be time consuming and costly to defend. In addition, defects could result in significant costs. See also, \u201cCosts related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.\u201d\nTo the extent that we rely on outside suppliers to manufacture or assemble and test our products, we may have a reduced ability to directly control product delivery schedules and quality assurance, which could result in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could delay shipments or increase costs.\nCommodity Prices\nWe are also subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, including gold and copper, which are incorporated into our end products or used by our suppliers to manufacture our end products. Supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted, or general market factors and conditions may affect pricing of such commodities.\nWe may experience increased actual and opportunity costs as a result of our transition to smaller geometry process technologies.\nIn order to remain competitive, we have transitioned, and expect to continue to transition, our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries. We periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies. We also evaluate the costs of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies including both actual costs such as increased mask costs and wafer costs and increased costs related to EDA tools and the opportunity costs related to the technologies we choose to forego. These transitions are imperative for us to be competitive with the rest of the industry and to target some of our product development in high growth areas to these advanced nodes, which has resulted in significant initial design and development costs.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, dependent on our relationships with our foundry subcontractors to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot ensure that the foundries we use will be able to effectively manage any future transitions. If we or any of our foundry subcontractors experience significant delays in a future transition or fail to efficiently implement a transition, we could experience reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses, all of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our results of operations.\nAs smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third-party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, if at all. Moreover, even if we are able to achieve higher levels of design integration, such integration may have a short-term adverse impact on our results of operations, as we may reduce our revenue by integrating the functionality of multiple chips into a single chip.\nWe rely on our customers to design our products into their systems, and the nature of the design process requires us to incur expenses prior to customer commitments to use our products or recognizing revenues associated with those expenses which may adversely affect our financial results.\nOne of our primary focuses is on winning competitive bid selection processes, known as \u201cdesign wins,\u201d to develop products for use in our customers\u2019 products. We devote significant time and resources in working with our customers\u2019 system designers to understand their future needs and to provide products that we believe will meet those needs and these bid selection processes can be lengthy. If a customer\u2019s system designer initially chooses a competitor\u2019s product, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products for use in that system because changing suppliers can involve significant cost, time, effort and risk for our customers. Thus, our failure to win a competitive bid can result in our foregoing revenues from a given customer\u2019s product line for the life of that product. In addition, design opportunities may be infrequent or may be delayed. Our ability to compete in the future will depend, in large part, on our ability to design products to ensure compliance with our customers\u2019 and potential customers\u2019 specifications. We expect to invest significant time and resources and to incur significant expenses to design our products to ensure compliance with relevant specifications.\nWe often incur significant expenditures in the development of a new product without any assurance that our customers\u2019 system designers will select our product for use in their applications. We often are required to anticipate which product designs will generate demand in advance of our customers expressly indicating a need for that particular design. Even if our customers\u2019 system designers select our products, a substantial period of time will elapse before we generate revenues related to the significant expenses we have incurred.\nThe reasons for this delay generally include the following elements of our product sales and development cycle timeline and related influences:\n\u2022our customers usually require a comprehensive technical evaluation of our products before they incorporate them into their designs,\n\u2022it can take from six months to three years from the time our products are selected to commence commercial shipments; and\n\u2022our customers may experience changed market conditions or product development issues. The resources devoted to product development and sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us, and from time to time, we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory if we have produced product in anticipation of expected demand. We may spend resources on the development of products that our customers may not adopt. If we incur significant expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover, and we are not able to compensate for those expenses, our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory, our operating results would be harmed.\nAdditionally, even if system designers use our products in their systems, we cannot assure you that these systems will be commercially successful or that we will receive significant revenue from the sales of our products for those systems. As a result, we may be unable to accurately forecast the volume and timing of our orders and revenues associated with any new product introductions.\nAdditionally, failure of our customers to agree to pay for NRE (non-recurring engineering) costs or failure to pay enough to cover the costs we incur in connection with NREs may harm our financial results. See also, \"Research and Development\" under Results of Operations.\nIf we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner, our results of operations and competitive position will be harmed.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products that address customer requirements, in a timely and cost-effective manner and are competitive as to a variety of factors. For example, for our products addressing the 5G market, we must successfully identify customer requirements and design, develop and produce products on time that compete effectively as to price, functionality and performance. We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries. In addition, the development of new silicon devices is highly complex and, due to supply chain cross-dependencies and other issues, we may experience delays in completing the development, production and introduction of our new products. See also, \u201cWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.\u201d\nOur ability to adapt to changes and to anticipate future standards, and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards, will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth. We may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards. Our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the markets they serve and to introduce and promote those products successfully and in a timely manner. Even if we and our customers introduce new and enhanced products to the market, those products may not achieve market acceptance.\nCosts related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced hardware and software defects and bugs associated with the introduction of our highly complex products. Despite our testing procedures, we cannot ensure that errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future. Such errors could result in:\n\u2022loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022material recall and replacement costs;\n\u2022delay in revenue recognition or loss of revenue;\n\u2022writing down the inventory of defective products;\n\u2022the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts;\n\u2022our having to defend against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury; and\n\u2022damage to our reputation in the industry that could adversely affect our relationships with our customers.\nIn addition, the process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources. We may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field, which may cause us to incur significant replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and further reputational harm. Any of these problems could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nDespite our best efforts, security vulnerabilities may exist with respect to our products. Mitigation techniques designed to address such security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, may not operate as intended or effectively resolve such vulnerabilities. Software and firmware updates and/or other mitigation efforts may result in performance issues, system instability, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, or the theft of data by third parties, any of which could significantly harm our business and reputation.\nWe rely on third-party distributors and manufacturers\u2019 representatives and the failure of these distributors and manufacturers\u2019 representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales.\nFrom time to time, we enter into relationships with distributors and manufacturers\u2019 representatives to sell our products, and we are unable to predict the extent to which these partners will be successful in marketing and selling our products. Moreover, many of our distributors and manufacturers\u2019 representatives also market and sell competing products, and may terminate their relationships with us at any time. Our future performance will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract additional distributors or manufacturers\u2019 representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively, especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products. If we cannot retain or attract quality distributors or manufacturers\u2019 representatives, our sales and results of operations will be harmed.\nCHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nUnfavorable or uncertain conditions in the 5G infrastructure market may cause fluctuations in our rate of revenue growth or financial results.\nMarkets for 5G infrastructure may not develop in the manner or in the time periods we anticipate. If domestic and global economic conditions worsen, particularly in light of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential global recession resulting therefrom, overall spending on 5G infrastructure may be reduced, which would adversely impact demand for our products in these markets. In addition, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or 5G suppliers may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, and negatively impact our long-term expectations in this area. Even if the 5G infrastructure market develops in the manner or in the time periods we anticipate, if we do not have timely, competitively priced, market-accepted products available to meet our customers\u2019 planned roll-out of 5G wireless communication systems, we may miss a significant opportunity and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See also, \u201cOur sales are concentrated in a few large customers. If we lose or experience a significant reduction in sales to any of these key customers, if any of these key customers experience a significant decline in market share, or if any of these customers experience significant financial difficulties, our revenue may decrease substantially and our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\u201d for additional risks related to export restrictions that may impact a customer in the 5G infrastructure market.\nOur sales are concentrated in a few large customers. If we lose or experience a significant reduction in sales to any of these key customers, if any of these key customers experience a significant decline in market share, or if any of these customers experience significant financial difficulties, our revenue may decrease substantially and our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers. For example, during fiscal 2021, there was one distributor, whose revenue as a percentage of our net revenue was 10% or greater of total net revenues. In addition, net revenue from our two largest customers, including this distributor, represented 22% of our net revenue for the year ended January 30, 2021. Sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period and year to year and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future, primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer, the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets, and natural disasters or other issues that may divert a customer\u2019s operations. The loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations. To the extent one or more of our large customers experience significant financial difficulty, bankruptcy or insolvency, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales and our ability to collect on receivables, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to increase the number of large customers in key markets, then our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers, as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products. In the future, these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past, or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:\n\u2022a significant portion of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which allows our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with relatively short notice to us;\n\u2022customers may purchase similar products from our competitors;\n\u2022customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products;\n\u2022customers, particularly in jurisdictions such as China that may be subject to trade restrictions or tariffs, may develop their own solutions or acquire fully developed solutions from third-parties;\n\u2022customers may be subject to severe business disruptions, including, but not limited to, those driven by financial instability, actual or threatened pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or public health emergencies or other global or regional macroeconomic developments; or\n\u2022customers may consolidate (for example, Western Digital acquired SanDisk in 2017, and Toshiba Corporation sold control of a portion of its semiconductor business in 2018), which could lead to changing demand for our products, replacement of our products by the merged entity with those of our competitors and cancellation of orders.\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our gross margin. Conversely, we may have insufficient inventory or be unable to obtain the supplies or contract manufacturing capacity to meet that demand which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potential loss of market share as well as damaged customer relationships.\nWe typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments. Customers can generally cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. Due to their inability to predict demand or other reasons, some of our customers may accumulate excess inventories and, as a consequence, defer purchase of our products. We cannot accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future. Anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management. In addition, as an increasing number of our chips are being incorporated into consumer products, we anticipate greater fluctuations in demand for our products, which makes it more difficult to forecast customer demand.\nWe place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and, in some instances, may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. For example, our ability to accurately forecast customer demand may be impaired by the delays inherent in our customer\u2019s product development processes, which may include extensive qualification and testing of components included in their products, including ours. In many cases, they design their products to use components from multiple suppliers. This creates the risk that our customers may decide to cancel or change product plans for products incorporating our integrated circuits prior to completion, which makes it even more difficult to forecast customer demand.\nOur products are incorporated into complex devices and systems, which creates supply chain cross-dependencies. Due to cross dependencies, any supply chain disruptions could negatively impact the demand for our products in the short term. We have a limited ability to predict the timing of a supply chain correction. In addition, the market share of our customers could be adversely impacted on a long-term basis due to any continued supply chain disruption, which could negatively affect our results of operations. See also, \"We rely on independent foundries and subcontractors for the manufacture, assembly and testing of our integrated circuit products, and the failure of any of these third-party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our ability to grow our business\" for additional information on the impacts of supply chain cross-dependencies on our business.\nIf we overestimate customer demand, our excess or obsolete inventory may increase significantly, which would reduce our gross margin and adversely affect our financial results. The risk of obsolescence and/or excess inventory is heightened for devices designed for consumer electronics due to the rapidly changing market for these types of products. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect our profit margins, increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.\nWe operate in intensely competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively would harm our results of operations.\nThe semiconductor industry, and specifically the storage, networking and infrastructure markets, is extremely competitive. We currently compete with a number of large domestic and international companies in the business of designing integrated circuits and related applications, some of which have greater financial, technical and management resources than us. Our efforts to introduce new products into markets with entrenched competitors will expose us to additional competitive pressures. For example, we are facing, and expect we will continue to face, significant competition in the infrastructure, networking and SSD storage markets. Additionally, customer expectations and requirements have been evolving rapidly. For example, customers now expect us to provide turnkey solutions and commit to future roadmaps that have technical risks.\nSome of our competitors may be better situated to meet changing customer needs and secure design wins. Increasing competition in the markets in which we operate may negatively impact our revenue and gross margins. For example, competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices than us, or they may offer additional products, services or other incentives that we may not be able to match.\nWe also may experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices by our competitors that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business. In addition, some of these competitors may use their market power to dissuade our customers from purchasing from us. For example, certain U.S. and E.U. regulators are currently investigating whether a competitor may have abused its dominant market position to harm competition by forcing customers to deal with it exclusively, bundling its various semiconductors with other products, or by distorting the market by using illegal rebates.\nIn addition, many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and greater sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do.\nIn addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced increased consolidation over the past several years. For example, Microchip Technology acquired Microsemi in May 2018 and ON Semiconductor purchased Quantenna Communications, Inc. in June 2019, NVIDIA Corporation acquired Mellanox Technologies on April 27, 2020 and Infineon acquired Cypress Semiconductors on April 16, 2020. In July 2020, Analog Devices Inc. announced its intent to merge with Maxim Integrated Products Inc. In September 2020, NVIDIA announced its intent to acquire Arm Limited. We license technology from Arm Limited and would be adversely impacted if the pricing for, or availability of, the relevant technology is changed in an adverse manner as a result of this transaction. In October 2020, AMD announced its intent to acquire Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation among our competitors has led, and in the future could lead, to a changing competitive landscape, capabilities and market share, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue comes from the storage industry, which experiences rapid technological change, is subject to industry consolidation, is facing increased competition from alternative technologies and is highly cyclical.\nWe depend on a few customers for our SSD controllers and as such, the loss of any SSD controller customer or a significant reduction in sales we make to them may harm our financial condition and results of operations. SSD customers have, and may in the future develop their own controllers, which could pose a challenge to our market share in the SSD space and adversely affect our revenues in the storage business.\nFurthermore, future changes in the nature of information storage products and personal computing devices could reduce demand for traditional HDDs. For example, products using alternative technologies, such as SSD and other storage technologies are a source of competition to manufacturers of HDDs. Although we offer SSD controllers, leveraging our technology in hard drives, we cannot ensure that our overall business will not be adversely affected if demand for traditional HDDs decreases.\nManufacturers tend to order more components than they may need during growth periods, and sharply reduce orders for components during periods of contraction. Rapid technological changes in the industry often result in shifts in market share among the industry\u2019s participants. If the HDD and SSD manufacturers using our products do not retain or increase their market share, our sales may decrease.\nIn addition, the storage industry has experienced significant consolidation. Consolidation among our customers will lead to changing demand for our products, replacement of our products by the merged entity with those of our competitors and cancellation of orders, each of which could harm our results of operations. If we are unable to leverage our technology and customer relationships, we may not capitalize on the increased opportunities for our products within the combined company.\nThis industry has historically been cyclical, with periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction. These cycles may affect us because some of our largest customers participate in this industry.\nAs a result, the average selling price of each of our products usually declines as individual products mature and competitors enter the market.\nOur gross margin and results of operations may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in average selling prices of products over time and shifts in our product mix as well as the price increase of certain components and testing and assembly.\nThe products we develop and sell are primarily used for high-volume applications. As a result, the prices of those products have historically decreased rapidly. In addition, our more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development and production expenses. Therefore, over time, we may not be able to maintain or improve our gross margins. Our financial results could suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by other cost reductions through efficiencies, introduction of higher margin products and other means.\nTo attract new customers or retain existing customers, we may offer certain price concessions to certain customers, which could cause our average selling prices and gross margins to decline. In the past, we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or by our competitors and other factors. We expect that we will continue to have to reduce prices of existing products in the future. Moreover, because of the wide price differences across the markets we serve, the mix and types of performance capabilities of our products sold may affect the average selling prices of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue and gross margin. We may enter new markets in which a significant amount of competition exists, and this may require us to sell our products with lower gross margins than we earn in our established businesses. If we are successful in growing revenue in these markets, our overall gross margin may decline. Fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover the fixed costs and investments associated with a particular product, and as a result may harm our financial results.\nAdditionally, because we do not operate our own manufacturing, assembly or testing facilities, we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase, which could also reduce our gross margins. Our gross margin could also be impacted by increased cost (including those caused by tariffs), loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates as well as excess inventory and inventory holding and obsolescence charges. In addition, we are subject to risks from fluctuating market prices of certain components, which are incorporated into our products or used by our suppliers to manufacture our products. Supplies of these components may from time to time become restricted, or general market factors and conditions may affect pricing of such commodities. For example, recent supply shortages in the semiconductor industry of multi-layer complex substrates, IC packaging capacity and fab constraints have resulted in increased lead times, inability to meet demand, and increased costs. Any increase in the price of components used in our products will adversely affect our gross margins.\nEntry into new markets, such as markets with different business models, as a result of our acquisitions may reduce our gross margin and operating margin. For example, the Avera business uses an ASIC model to offer end-to-end solutions for IP, design team, Fab & packaging to deliver a tested, yielded product to customers. This business model tends to have a lower gross margin. In addition, the costs related to this type of business model typically include significant NRE (non-recurring engineering) costs that customers pay based on the completion of milestones. Our operating margin may decline if our customers do not agree to pay for NREs or if they do not pay enough to cover the costs we incur in connection with NREs. In addition, our operating margin may decline if we are unable to sell products in sufficient volumes to cover the development costs that we have incurred.\nCHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY REDUCE OUR NET INCOME\nChanges in existing taxation benefits, rules or practices may adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in existing taxation benefits, rules or practices may also have a significant effect on our reported results. Both the U.S. Congress and the G-20 (Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors) may consider legislation affecting the taxation of foreign corporations and such legislation if enacted might adversely affect our future tax liabilities and have a material impact on our results of operations.\nIn addition, in prior years, we have entered into incentive agreements in certain foreign jurisdictions that if certain criteria are met, the foreign jurisdiction will provide a more favorable tax rate than their current statutory rate. For example, we have obtained an undertaking from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda that in the event Bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on profits, income, or capital asset, gain or appreciation, then the imposition of any such taxes will not apply to us until March 31, 2035. Additionally, our Singapore subsidiary qualifies for the Development and Expansion Incentive until June 2024. Furthermore, under the Israeli Encouragement law of \u201capproved or benefited enterprise,\u201d our subsidiary in Israel, Marvell Israel (M.I.S.L) Ltd., is entitled to, and has certain existing programs that qualify as, approved and benefited tax programs that include reduced tax rates and exemption of certain income through fiscal 2027. Moreover, receipt of past and future benefits under tax agreements may depend on our ability to fulfill commitments regarding employment of personnel or performance of specified activities in the applicable jurisdiction. Changes in our business plans, including divestitures, could result in termination of an agreement or loss of benefits thereunder. If any of our tax agreements in any of these foreign jurisdictions were terminated, our results of operations would be harmed.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Sharing Project, and issued in 2015, and is expected to continue to issue, guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in some of the countries in which we do business. We can provide no assurance that changes in tax laws and additional investigations as a result of this project would not have an adverse tax impact on our international operations. In addition, the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) has initiated its own measures along similar lines. In December 2017, the EU identified certain jurisdictions (including Bermuda and Cayman Islands) which it considered had a tax system that facilitated offshore structuring by attracting profits without commensurate economic activity. In order to avoid EU \u201cblacklisting\u201d, both Bermuda and Cayman Islands introduced new legislation in December 2018, which came into force on January 1, 2019. These new laws require Bermuda and Cayman companies carrying on one or more \u201crelevant activity\u201d (including: banking, insurance, fund management, financing, leasing, headquarters, shipping, distribution and service center, intellectual property or holding company) to maintain a substantial economic presence in Bermuda in order to comply with the economic substance requirements. It is still not clear how the Bermuda and Cayman Islands authorities will interpret and enforce these new rules. To the extent that we are required to maintain more of a presence in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, such requirements will increase our costs either directly in those locations or indirectly as a result of increased costs related to moving our operations to other jurisdictions.\nIn addition, in a prior period, the Company transferred certain intellectual property to a related entity in Singapore. The impact to the Company was determined based on our determination of the fair value of this property, which required management to make significant estimates and to apply complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. In a future period, local tax authorities may challenge the fair value determinations made by the Company, which could adversely impact our expected tax benefits from this transaction.\nOn October 29, 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Inphi Corporation (\u201cInphi\u201d), Marvell Technology, Inc. (f/k/a Maui HoldCo, Inc.), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Marvell (\u201cHoldCo\u201d), Maui Acquisition Company Ltd., a Bermuda exempted company and a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo (\u201cBermuda Merger Sub\u201d), and Indigo Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo (\u201cDelaware Merger Sub\u201d), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Company will acquire Inphi with cash and stock consideration. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement: (i) Bermuda Merger Sub will be merged with and into Marvell (the \u201cBermuda Merger\u201d), with Marvell continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo; and (ii) Delaware Merger Sub will be merged with and into Inphi (the \u201cDelaware Merger\u201d and, together with the Bermuda Merger, the \u201cMergers\u201d), with Inphi continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo. As a result of this transaction, upon closing, the parent company will be domiciled in the US and not Bermuda. As a result, the combined group will be subject to taxation in the US, which currently has a federal tax rate of 21%, and that federal income tax rate could be increased in the future by the current Congress and presidential administration, which has proposed raising it to as high as 28%. This may cause our overall effective tax rate to increase significantly versus our current corporate effective tax rate as a Bermuda-domiciled company, which could materially impact our financial results, including our earnings and cash flow, for periods after the completion of the proposed Mergers.\nOur profitability and effective tax rate could be impacted by unexpected changes to our statutory income tax rates or income tax liabilities. Such changes might include changes in tax law or regulations, changes to our geographic mix of earnings, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our supply chain and changes due to audit assessments. In particular, the tax benefits associated with our transfer of intellectual property to Singapore are sensitive to future profitability and taxable income in Singapore, audit assessments, and changes in applicable tax law. Our current corporate effective tax rate fluctuates significantly from period to period, and is based upon the application of currently applicable income tax laws, regulations and treaties, as well as current judicial and administrative interpretations of these income tax laws, regulations and treaties, in various jurisdictions.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATED TO OUR ASSETS\nWe are exposed to potential impairment charges on certain assets.\nWe had approximately $5.3 billion of goodwill and $2.3 billion of acquired intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 30, 2021. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we are required to review our intangible assets including goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We perform an assessment of goodwill for impairment annually on the last business day of our fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or we may determine to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.\nFactors we consider important in the qualitative assessment which could trigger a goodwill impairment review include: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; significant negative industry or economic trends; a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value.\nWe assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to the following: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life.\nFor example, during the second quarter ended August 1, 2020, we made changes to the scope of our server processor product line in response to changes in the associated market. We are transitioning our product offering from standard server processors to the broad server market to focus only on customized server processors for a few targeted customers. This change in strategy required the Company to assess whether the carrying value of the associated assets would be recoverable. As a result of the assessment, we determined the carrying amount of certain impacted assets are not recoverable, which have resulted in recognition of $119.0 million of restructuring related charges associated with the server processor product line during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. See \u201cNote 6 - Restructuring\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nWe have determined that our business operates as a single operating segment with two primary components (Storage and Networking), which we have concluded can be aggregated into a single reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill impairment. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by taking our market capitalization as determined through quoted market prices and as adjusted for a control premium and other relevant factors. If our fair value declines to below our carrying value, we could incur significant goodwill impairment charges, which could negatively impact our financial results. If in the future a change in our organizational structure results in more than one reporting unit, we will be required to allocate our goodwill and perform an assessment of goodwill for impairment in each reporting unit. As a result, we could have an impairment of goodwill in one or more of such future reporting units.\nIn addition, from time to time, we have made investments in private companies. If the companies that we invest in are unable to execute their plans and succeed in their respective markets, we may not benefit from such investments, and we could potentially lose the amounts we invest. We evaluate our investment portfolio on a regular basis to determine if impairments have occurred. If the operations of any businesses that we have acquired declines significantly, we could incur significant intangible asset impairment charges. Impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations in any period.\nWe are subject to the risks of owning real property.\nOur buildings in Santa Clara, California and Shanghai, China subject us to the risks of owning real property, which include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with remediating any environmental problems;\n\u2022adverse changes in the value of these properties due to interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located, or other factors;\n\u2022the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning, seismic and other legal or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the potential disruption of our business and operations arising from or connected with a relocation due to moving to or renovating the facility;\n\u2022increased cash commitments for improvements to the buildings or the property, or both;\n\u2022increased operating expenses for the buildings or the property, or both;\n\u2022possible disputes with third parties related to the buildings or the property, or both;\n\u2022failure to achieve expected cost savings due to extended non-occupancy of a vacated property intended to be leased; and\n\u2022the risk of financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance, or uninsured risks, such as the loss caused by damage to the buildings as a result of earthquakes, floods and/or other natural disasters.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO IP RISKS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.\nWe believe one of our key competitive advantages results from the collection of proprietary technologies we have developed and acquired since our inception, and the protection of our intellectual property rights is, and will continue to be, important to the success of our business. If we fail to protect these intellectual property rights, competitors could sell products based on technology that we have developed, which could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenue.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, contractual provisions, confidentiality agreements, licenses and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies. We also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and business partners, and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information. Notwithstanding these agreements, we have experienced disputes with employees regarding ownership of intellectual property in the past. To the extent that any third party has a claim to ownership of any relevant technologies used in our products, we may not be able to recognize the full revenue stream from such relevant technologies.\nWe have been issued a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and have a significant number of pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. However, a patent may not be issued as a result of any applications or, if issued, claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We may also be required to license some of our patents to others including competitors as a result of our participation in and contribution to development of industry standards. Despite our efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or proprietary technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and the steps that we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in jurisdictions where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States or other developed countries. If our patents do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours, which would adversely impact our business and results of operations. We have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our confidential information including our intellectual property. Despite our efforts, we may be subject to breach of these security systems and controls which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and labs and/or unauthorized use or theft of the confidential information and intellectual property we are trying to protect. If we fail to protect these intellectual property rights, competitors could sell products based on technology that we have developed, which could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenue.\nCertain of our software, as well as that of our customers, may be derived from so-called \u201copen source\u201d software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and/or other third parties. Open source software is made available under licenses that impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public and/or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of license we customarily use to protect our intellectual property. While we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software, in the event that the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and/or stop distribution of that work if the license is terminated which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe must comply with a variety of existing and future laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs on us and may adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: intellectual property ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; conflict minerals; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health and safety requirements; and consumer laws. For example, government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products. If we fail to continue to receive licenses or otherwise comply with these regulations, we may be unable to manufacture the affected products at foreign foundries or ship these products to certain customers, or we may incur penalties or fines. In addition, we are subject to various industry requirements restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products. Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with such laws and regulations. Our compliance programs rely in part on compliance by our suppliers, vendors and distributors. To the extent such third parties don't comply with these obligations our business, operations and reputation may be adversely impacted. If we violate or fail to comply with any of the above requirements, a range of consequences could result, including fines, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. The costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of any investigations, auditing and monitoring) could adversely affect our current or future business.\nOur product or manufacturing standards could also be impacted by new or revised environmental rules and regulations or other social initiatives. For example, a significant portion of our revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China\u2019s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our revenues from the EU, China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements.\nIn connection with some of our acquisitions, we have been subject to regulatory conditions imposed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) where we have agreed to implement certain cyber security, physical security and training measures and supply agreements to protect national security. A portion of the business we acquired in the Avera acquisition requires facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program. The National Industrial Security Program requires that a corporation maintaining a facility security clearance be effectively insulated from foreign ownership, control or influence (\u201cFOCI\u201d). Because we are organized in Bermuda, we have entered into agreements with the U.S. Department of Defense with respect to FOCI mitigation arrangements that relate to our operation of the portion of the Avera business involving facility clearances. These measures and arrangements may materially and adversely affect our operating results due to the increased cost of compliance with these measures. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, our ability to operate our business may be adversely affected. As a result of the proposed transaction with Inphi, our parent company will be domiciled in the United States upon closing of the transaction. As a result, we plan to request to be released from some of the above obligations. We can offer no assurance that such a request will be granted in a timely manner or at all.\nPrimarily as a result of our acquisition of Avera, we are now a party to certain contracts with the U.S. government or its subcontractors. Our contracts with government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. Any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results.\nWe have been named as a party to several legal proceedings and may be named in additional ones in the future, including litigation involving our patents and other intellectual property, which could subject us to liability, require us to indemnify our customers, require us to obtain or renew licenses, require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products.\nWe are currently, and have been in the past, named as a party to several lawsuits, government inquiries or investigations and other legal proceedings (referred to as \u201clitigation\u201d), and we may be named in additional ones in the future. Please see \u201cNote 12 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of material litigation matters in which we may be currently engaged. See also, \u201cLitigation filed against Marvell and Inphi could prevent or delay the completion of the Mergers or result in the payment of damages following completion of the Mergers.\u201d\nIn particular, litigation involving patents and other intellectual property is widespread in the high-technology industry and is particularly prevalent in the semiconductor industry, where a number of companies and other entities aggressively bring numerous infringement claims to assert their patent portfolios. The amount of damages alleged in intellectual property infringement claims can often be very significant. See also, \u201cWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.\u201d\nFrom time to time, our subsidiaries and customers receive, and may continue to receive in the future, standards-based or other types of infringement claims, as well as claims against us and our subsidiaries\u2019 proprietary technologies. These claims could result in litigation and/or claims for indemnification, which, in turn, could subject us to significant liability for damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022stop selling, offering for sale, making, having made or exporting products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property;\n\u2022limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for us;\n\u2022pay substantial damages and/or license fees and/or royalties to the party claiming infringement or other license violations that could adversely impact our liquidity or operating results;\n\u2022attempt to obtain or renew licenses to the relevant intellectual property, which licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; and\n\u2022attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property.\nUnder certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses for current and former directors and officers. See also, \u201cOur indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d Additionally, from time to time, we have agreed to indemnify select customers for claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, patents, registered trademarks and/or copyrights. If we are required to make a significant payment under any of our indemnification obligations, our results of operations may be harmed.\nThe ultimate outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price for our securities. Litigation may be time consuming, expensive, and disruptive to normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. Litigation, regardless of the outcome, may result in significant expenditures, diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business and damage to our reputation or relationship with third parties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATED TO OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOn July 6, 2018, in connection with our acquisition of Cavium, we incurred substantial indebtedness pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the \u201c2018 Credit Agreement\u201d). The 2018 Credit Agreement provides for a $900 million Term Loan (the \u201c2018 Term Loan\u201d). The 2018 Term Loan will mature on July 6, 2021. As of January 30, 2021, the outstanding principal balance of the 2018 Term Loan amounted to $200 million. See \u201cNote 11 - Debt\u201d for discussion of the debt financing in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we intend to pay the cash portion of the consideration for the Mergers and other fees and expenses required to be paid in connection with the Mergers from cash on hand and borrowings. We have obtained financing commitments for (i) a $2.5 billion senior 364-day bridge term loan facility (the \u201cBridge Facility\u201d) pursuant to a commitment letter (the \u201cBridge Commitment Letter\u201d) dated as of October 29, 2020, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJPMorgan\u201d) and the other financial institutions that have joined thereto, and (ii) a $1.75 billion senior unsecured term loan facility comprised of a $875.0 million 3-year term loan tranche (the \u201c3 Year Term Loan\u201d) and a $875.0 million 5-year term loan tranche (the \u201c5-Year Term Loan,\u201d and collectively with the 3-Year Term Loan, the \u201c2020 Term Loan Facility\u201d) pursuant to a credit agreement, dated December 7, 2020 (the \u201c2020 Term Loan Agreement\u201d), with JPMorgan, as administrative agent and a lender, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto.\nPursuant to the Bridge Commitment Letter and the 2020 Term Loan Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, JPMorgan and the other lenders party thereto have committed to provide the full amount of the Bridge Facility and the Term Loan Facility, as applicable. The funding of the Bridge Facility provided for in the Bridge Commitment Letter and the funding of the Term Loan Facility provided for in the 2020 Term Loan Agreement, in each case, is contingent upon the satisfaction of customary conditions, including (i) execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the Bridge Facility in accordance with the terms set forth in the Bridge Commitment Letter and (ii) consummation of the Mergers in accordance with the Merger Agreement. The actual documentation governing the Bridge Facility has not been finalized, and accordingly, the actual terms may differ from the description of such terms in the applicable Bridge Commitment Letter. Availability under the Bridge Facility will be reduced by the net cash proceeds from customary mandatory commitment reduction and prepayment events from issuances of equity, the incurrence of certain other debt or the sale of available assets, in each case subject to limited exceptions. We expect to replace some or all of the Bridge Facility prior to the closing of the Mergers with permanent financing comprised of senior unsecured notes. There can be no assurance that the permanent financing will be completed.\nIn addition to the loans under the credit agreements, on June 22, 2018, we completed a public offering of (i) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s 4.200% Senior Notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d) and (ii) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s 4.875% Senior Notes due 2028 (the \u201c2028 Notes\u201d and, together with the 2023 Notes, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). We are obligated to pay interest on the Senior Notes on June 22 and December 22 of each year, beginning on December 22, 2018. The 2023 Notes will mature on June 22, 2023 and the 2028 Notes will mature on June 22, 2028.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to us including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, execution of our business strategy, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n\u2022exposing us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness; and\n\u2022making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes.\nAlthough the credit agreements contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the indenture under which the Senior Notes were issued contains restrictions on creating liens and entering into certain sale-leaseback transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness, liens or sale-leaseback transactions incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nThe credit agreements and the Senior Notes contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which, after any applicable grace period, the lenders would have the ability to immediately declare the loans due and payable in whole or in part. In such event, we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due, or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to access cash or to incur additional indebtedness if the COVID-19 pandemic causes the closure of banks for an extended period of time or if there is a sudden increase in requests for indebtedness at one time by many potential borrowers which could overwhelm the banking industry.\nAdverse changes to our debt ratings could negatively affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nWe receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies. The applicable margins with respect to the Term Loan will vary based on the applicable public ratings assigned to the collateralized, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, Fitch\u2019s and any successor to each such rating agency business. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of current or future debt and may adversely affect our share price.\nThe Credit Agreements and the indenture under which the Senior Notes were issued impose restrictions on our business.\nThe credit agreements and the indenture for the Senior Notes each contains a number of covenants imposing restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions, among other things, restrict our ability and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to create or incur certain liens, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other companies, pay dividends, transfer or sell assets and make restricted payments. These restrictions are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions set forth in the credit agreements and the indenture for the Senior Notes. Our ability to meet the liquidity covenant or the leverage ratio set forth in the credit agreements may be affected by events beyond our control.\nThe foregoing restrictions could limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in market conditions or our capital needs. We do not know whether we will be granted waivers under, or amendments to, our credit agreements or to the Senior Notes if for any reason we are unable to meet these requirements, or whether we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe may be unable to generate the cash flow to service our debt obligations.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt obligations, refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt (including the Senior Notes) or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under SEC guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us, potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration.\nWe may, under certain circumstances, be required to repurchase the Senior Notes at the option of the holder.\nWe will be required to repurchase the Senior Notes at the option of each holder upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event as defined in the indenture for the Senior Notes. However, we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the notes in cash at the time of any change of control repurchase event. Our failure to repurchase the Senior Notes upon a change of control repurchase event would be an event of default under the indenture for the Senior Notes and could cause a cross-default or acceleration under certain future agreements governing our other indebtedness. The repayment obligations under the Senior Notes may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of our company. If we were required to pay the Senior Notes prior to their scheduled maturity, it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY RISKS\nCybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations.\nWe depend heavily on our technology infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. We routinely collect and store sensitive data in our information systems, including intellectual property and other proprietary information about our business and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners. These information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, destructive or inadequate code, malware, power failures, cyber-attacks, internal malfeasance or other events. Cyber-attacks on us may include viruses and worms, phishing attacks, and denial-of-service attacks. In addition, we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information or company assets.\nWe have implemented processes for systems under our control intended to mitigate risks; however, we can provide no guarantee that those risk mitigation measures will be effective. While we have historically been successful in defending against cyber-attacks and breaches, given the frequency of cyber-attacks and resulting breaches reported by other businesses and governments, it is likely we will experience one or more breaches of some extent in the future. We have incurred and may in the future incur significant costs in order to implement, maintain and/or update security systems we feel are necessary to protect our information systems, or we may miscalculate the level of investment necessary to protect our systems adequately. Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.\nThe Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures may not always be effective and data breaches, losses or other unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results and could result in liability or penalties under data privacy laws.\nTo the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in material disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to our data or confidential information, including our intellectual property, our reputation, business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nWe depend on highly skilled personnel to support our business operations. If we are unable to retain and motivate our current personnel or attract additional qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed.\nWe believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, engineering, sales and marketing personnel. The competition for qualified technical personnel with significant experience in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of integrated circuits is intense, both in the Silicon Valley where our U.S. operations are based and in global markets in which we operate. Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including hardware and software engineers and sales and marketing personnel, could delay the development and introduction of, and harm our ability to sell, our products. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel also depends on how well we maintain a strong workplace culture that is attractive to employees. Changes to United States immigration policies that restrict our ability to attract and retain technical personnel may negatively affect our research and development efforts.\nWe typically do not enter into employment agreements with any of our key technical personnel and the loss of such personnel could harm our business, as their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. The impact on employee morale experienced in connection with our recent restructuring efforts and in connection with our recent acquisitions and divestiture, could make it more difficult for us to add to our workforce when needed due to speculation regarding our future restructuring activities. In addition, as a result of our acquisitions and divestiture, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their futures that may impair our ability to retain, recruit or motivate key management, engineering, technical and other personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or effect share repurchases in any particular amount or at all, and statutory requirements under Bermuda Law may require us to defer payment of declared dividends or suspend share repurchases.\nIn May 2012, we declared our first quarterly cash dividend and in October 2018, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a $700 million addition to our previously existing $1 billion share repurchase program. An aggregate of $1.1 billion of shares have been repurchased under that program as of January 30, 2021. Future payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common shares and future share repurchases will be subject to, among other things: the best interests of our company and our shareholders; our results of operations, cash balances and future cash requirements; financial condition; developments in ongoing litigation; statutory requirements under Bermuda law; market conditions; and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our dividend payments or share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in, a delay of, or elimination of our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price. Our share repurchase program was temporarily suspended in late March 2020 to preserve cash during the COVID-19 pandemic and remains temporarily suspended to preserve cash in anticipation of the funding of our acquisition of Inphi. Although share repurchases were temporarily suspended during this time, as of January 30, 2021, there was $564.5 million remaining available for future share repurchases under the authorization. We will continue to evaluate business conditions to decide when we can restart the share repurchase program.\nOur indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnder Bermuda law, our articles of association and bye-laws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party, we have an obligation to indemnify, or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify, certain of our current and former directors and officers with respect to past, current and future investigations and litigation. For example, we incurred significant indemnification expenses in connection with the Audit Committee's independent investigation completed in March 2016 and related shareholder litigation and government investigations. In connection with some of these matters, we were required to, or we otherwise agreed to, advance, and have advanced, legal fees and related expenses to certain of our current and former directors and officers. Further, in the event the directors and officers are ultimately determined not to be entitled to indemnification, we may not be able to recover any amounts we previously advanced to them.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that future indemnification claims, including the cost of fees, penalties or other expenses, will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies, that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover our claims. Additionally, to the extent there is coverage of these claims, the insurers also may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters.\nFurthermore, the insurers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill their obligation to defend, pay or reimburse us for insured claims. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that claims will not arise that are in excess of the limits of our insurance or that are not covered by the terms of our insurance policy. Due to these coverage limitations, we may incur significant unreimbursed costs to satisfy our indemnification obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs we carry only limited insurance coverage, any incurred liability resulting from uncovered claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset losses from covered incidents, and we do not have coverage for certain losses. For example, there is very limited coverage available with respect to the services provided by our third-party foundries and assembly and test subcontractors. In the event of a natural disaster (such as an earthquake or tsunami), political or military turmoil, widespread public health emergencies including pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other significant disruptions to their operations, insurance may not adequately protect us from this exposure. We believe our existing insurance coverage is consistent with common practice, economic considerations and availability considerations. If our insurance coverage is insufficient to protect us against unforeseen catastrophic losses, any uncovered losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we were classified as a passive foreign investment company, there would be adverse tax consequences to U.S. holders of our ordinary shares.\nIf we were classified as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d or \u201cPFIC\u201d under section 1297 of the Internal Revenue Code, of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds ordinary shares, such U.S. holder generally would be taxed at ordinary income tax rates on any gain realized on the sale or exchange of the ordinary shares and on any \u201cexcess distributions\u201d (including constructive distributions) received on the ordinary shares. Such U.S. holder could also be subject to a special interest charge with respect to any such gain or excess distribution.\nWe would be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which either (i) at least 75% of our gross income is passive income or (ii) on average, the percentage of our assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income is at least 50% (determined on an average gross value basis). We were not classified as a PFIC for fiscal year 2020 or in any prior taxable year. Whether we will, in fact, be classified as a PFIC for any subsequent taxable year depends on our assets and income over the course of the relevant taxable year and, as a result, cannot be predicted with certainty. In particular, because the total value of our assets for purposes of the asset test will be calculated based upon the market price of our ordinary shares, a significant and sustained decline in the market price of our ordinary shares and corresponding market capitalization relative to our passive assets could result in our being classified as a PFIC. There can be no assurance that we will not be classified as a PFIC in the future or the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge our determination concerning PFIC status for any prior period.", "PERMNO": 88360, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "MRVL"}
