{"cik": "350797", "company": "EATON VANCE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger with Morgan Stanley\nOn October 7, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Morgan Stanley (Morgan Stanley), Mirror Merger Sub 1, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley (Merger Sub 1), and Mirror Merger Sub 2, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley (Merger Sub 2), pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into Eaton Vance (the First Merger), with Eaton Vance surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, and (ii) immediately following the completion of the First Merger, the surviving corporation from the First Merger will merge with and into Merger Sub 2 (the Second Merger and, together with the First Merger, the Mergers), with Merger Sub 2 surviving the Second Merger and continuing as a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. For more information regarding the proposed Mergers, you can read the information statement/prospectus filed on Form S-4 by Morgan Stanley on December 4, 2020 and the documents incorporated by reference therein and referred to therein under the caption \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nThe price of Morgan Stanley Common Stock might decline prior to the completion of the Mergers, which would reduce the value of the Merger Consideration (as defined below) to be received by our shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The market price of Morgan Stanley Common Stock at the time the Mergers are completed may vary significantly from the price on the date of the Merger Agreement. Upon completion of the Mergers, our shareholders will be entitled to receive for each share of Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock and Eaton Vance Voting Common Stock (together, Eaton Vance Common Stock) that they own, at the election of each shareholder, subject to automatic adjustment, consideration in the form of a\ncombination of Morgan Stanley Common Stock and cash (Mixed Consideration), only cash (Cash Consideration) or only Morgan Stanley Common Stock (Stock Consideration) (the consideration such holder elects, the Merger Consideration). The aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable in cash is fixed at $28.25 per share of Eaton Vance Common Stock and aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable in Morgan Stanley Common Stock is fixed at 0.5833 shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock per Share of Eaton Vance Common Stock. The aggregate amount of Merger Consideration will not be adjusted for changes in the stock prices of either company before the Mergers are completed. Even if an Eaton Vance shareholder elects to receive all cash in the Mergers, the amount of cash to which such shareholder is entitled will depend on the price of Morgan Stanley Common Stock at the time the Mergers are completed. As a result, any changes in the market price of Morgan Stanley Common Stock before the Mergers are completed will have a corresponding effect on the market value of the Merger Consideration received. Neither party has a right to terminate the Merger Agreement based solely (and in and of itself) upon changes in the market price of Morgan Stanley Common Stock or Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock.\nThe market price of Morgan Stanley Common Stock after the Mergers will be affected by factors different from those affecting the market price of Eaton Vance Common Stock, and may decline. Upon completion of the Mergers, holders of shares of Eaton Vance Common Stock will become holders of shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock. The businesses of Morgan Stanley differ from our business in important respects; accordingly, the results of operations of Morgan Stanley after the Mergers, as well as the market price of Morgan Stanley Common Stock, will be affected by factors different from those affecting our results of operations.\nAdditionally, the market price of Morgan Stanley Common Stock may fluctuate significantly following completion of the Mergers, and holders of Eaton Vance Common Stock could lose the value of their investment in Morgan Stanley Common Stock. The issuance of shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock in the Mergers could on its own have the effect of depressing the market price for Morgan Stanley Common Stock. In addition, many of our shareholders may decide not to hold the shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock they receive as a result of the Mergers. Other Eaton Vance shareholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock they receive as a result of the Mergers. Any such sales of Morgan Stanley Common Stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for Morgan Stanley Common Stock.\nMoreover, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, the Morgan Stanley Common Stock, regardless of Morgan Stanley\u2019s actual operating performance.\nWe may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the Mergers. Uncertainty about the effect of the Mergers on our employees may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Mergers, as our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon obtaining Eaton Vance Stockholder Approval (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (which approval was obtained on October 7, 2020), each share of our restricted stock and each restricted stock unit award that was then outstanding vested in full and was settled in unrestricted shares of our Non-Voting Common Stock. The accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards could result in key employee departures. If our employees depart, the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined business following the Mergers may be harmed, and the anticipated benefits of the Mergers may be adversely affected.\nCompletion of the Mergers is subject to many conditions; if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Mergers will not be completed. The obligation of each of Morgan Stanley, Eaton Vance, Merger Sub 1 and\nMerger Sub 2 to complete the Mergers is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of a number of conditions, including, among others: (i) the Eaton Vance Stockholder Approval (which approval was obtained on October 7, 2020), (ii) (A) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, or any extension thereof, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act) (in respect of which early termination was granted on November 10, 2020) and (B) certain governmental filings and/or approvals having been made, obtained or received (or the waiting periods with respect thereto having expired or been terminated), as applicable (in the case of Morgan Stanley\u2019s, Merger Sub 1\u2019s and Merger Sub 2\u2019s obligations to complete the Mergers, without the imposition of a requirement that Morgan Stanley or any of its subsidiaries (including Eaton Vance or our subsidiaries) take any action or comply with any restriction that Morgan Stanley would not be required to take or comply with under the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement and there being no pending litigation or similar legal action by any governmental authority in each case that seeks to impose a requirement that Morgan Stanley or any of its subsidiaries (including Eaton Vance or our subsidiaries) take any action or comply with any restriction that Morgan Stanley would not be required to take or comply with under the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement), (iii) absence of (x) any applicable law or order preventing or making illegal the consummation of the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (y) any litigation or similar legal action by any governmental authority (in any jurisdiction in which Morgan Stanley, Eaton Vance or any of our respective subsidiaries conducts material operations) seeking to prohibit or restrain the Mergers, (iv) approval for the listing on the NYSE of the shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock to be issued in the Mergers, subject to official notice of issuance, (v) in the case of Morgan Stanley\u2019s, Merger Sub 1\u2019s and Merger Sub 2\u2019s obligations to complete the Mergers, the accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement by us and, in the case of our obligation to complete the Merger, the accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement by Morgan Stanley, in each case, as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the date of completion of the Mergers, subject to certain materiality thresholds, (vi) in the case of Morgan Stanley\u2019s, Merger Sub 1\u2019s and Merger Sub 2\u2019s obligations to complete the Mergers, performance in all material respects by us of the obligations required to be performed by us at or prior to the effective time of the First Merger, and, in the case of our obligation to complete the Mergers, performance in all material respects by Morgan Stanley, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 of the obligations required to be performed by them at or prior to the effective time of the First Merger, (vii) in the case of Morgan Stanley\u2019s, Merger Sub 1\u2019s and Merger Sub 2\u2019s obligations to complete the Mergers, the absence since the date of the Merger Agreement of a material adverse effect on us, and, in the case of our obligation to complete the Mergers, the absence since the date of the Merger Agreement of a material adverse effect on Morgan Stanley, (viii) the receipt by Morgan Stanley of an opinion of Davis Polk, counsel to Morgan Stanley, to the effect that the Mergers, taken together as an integrated transaction, will be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), which opinion shall be dated the closing date; provided that if Davis Polk does not render such opinion for any reason, this condition will nonetheless be satisfied if a third party nationally recognized law or accounting firm as reasonably agreed by Morgan Stanley and us renders such opinion to Morgan Stanley, (ix) the receipt by us of an opinion of WilmerHale, counsel to Eaton Vance, to the effect that the Mergers, taken together as an integrated transaction, will be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, which opinion shall be dated the closing date; provided that if WilmerHale does not render such opinion for any reason, this condition will nonetheless be satisfied if a third party nationally recognized law or accounting firm as reasonably agreed by Morgan Stanley and us renders such opinion to us and (x) our obtaining the consent of our clients generating an aggregate management fee revenue run-rate of at least 80% of our aggregate management fee revenue run-rate as of September 30, 2020.\nThere can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the Mergers will be satisfied or waived or that the Mergers will be completed.\nOur business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Mergers. Parties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Mergers, including with respect to current or future business relationships with Eaton Vance or the combined business. Our business relationships may be subject to disruption as parties with which we do business may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than Eaton Vance or the combined business. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the parties\u2019 ability to complete the Mergers and the businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the combined business following in the Mergers, including an adverse effect on the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Mergers. The risk, and adverse effect, of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Mergers or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nFailure to complete the Mergers could adversely affect our stock price and future business and financial results. If the Mergers are not completed for any reason, the expected merger benefits will not be realized and our ongoing business may be adversely affected. Failure to complete the Mergers would subject us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022 we may experience adverse reactions from the financial markets, including negative effects on our stock price;\n\u2022 we may experience adverse reactions from clients, regulators and employees;\n\u2022 we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Mergers, whether or not the Mergers are completed;\n\u2022 the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Mergers, and such restrictions, the waiver of which are subject to the written consent of Morgan Stanley (in certain cases, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the Mergers that we would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place; and\n\u2022 matters relating to the Mergers (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nIn the event of a termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $206 million to Morgan Stanley. To the extent that a termination fee is not promptly paid when due, we will also be required to pay any reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Morgan Stanley in connection with legal action taken to enforce the Merger Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount against us for failing to promptly pay such amount, together with interest on the unpaid fee.\nThere can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materialize. If any of those risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results, ratings, stock price and/or bond prices.\nIn addition, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Mergers or related to any legal proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the\nMergers are not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results, debt ratings, stock price and/or market trading prices of our outstanding debt.\nThe shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock to be received by our shareholders upon completion of the Mergers will have different rights from shares of Eaton Vance Common Stock. Upon completion of the Mergers, our shareholders will no longer be shareholders of Eaton Vance but will instead become shareholders of Morgan Stanley. Our shareholders\u2019 rights as shareholders will, after completion of the Mergers, be governed by Delaware law (rather than Maryland law) and the terms of Morgan Stanley\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws are in some respects materially different than the terms of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, which currently govern the rights of our shareholders.\nOur stockholders may receive a form or combination of consideration different from what they elect. While each holder of Eaton Vance Common Stock entitled to the Merger Consideration may elect to receive, in connection with the Mergers, the Mixed Consideration, Cash Consideration or Stock Consideration, the total amount of cash and the total number of shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock available for all Eaton Vance shareholders will be fixed. Accordingly, depending on the elections made by other Eaton Vance shareholders, a holder of Eaton Vance Common Stock that elects to receive all cash in connection with the Mergers may receive a portion of the Merger Consideration in Morgan Stanley Common Stock and a holder of Eaton Vance Common Stock that elects to receive all Morgan Stanley Common Stock in connection with the Mergers may receive a portion of the Merger Consideration in cash.\nRisks Related to the Management of Our Business\nWe are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our investment management business. Our funds and separate accounts compete against a large number of investment strategies and services sold to the public by investment management companies, broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, banks, insurance companies and others. Many institutions we compete against have greater financial resources than us, and there are few barriers to entry. We compete with these firms on the basis of investment performance, diversity of offerings, distribution capability, scope and quality of services, reputation and the ability to develop new investment strategies and services to meet the changing needs of investors. To the extent that current or potential customers decide to invest in strategies sponsored by our competitors, the sales of our sponsored strategies, as well as our market share, revenue and net income, could decline. Our actively managed investment strategies compete not only against other active strategies, but also against similarly positioned index strategies. The continuing shift in market demand toward index funds and other passive strategies reduces opportunities for active managers and may accelerate fee compression as active managers reduce their fees to compete with lower-cost passive strategies. To the extent that trend continues, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe investment management industry is highly competitive and investment management customers are increasingly fee sensitive. In the event that competitors charge lower fees for substantially similar strategies and services, we may be forced to compete increasingly on the basis of price to attract and retain customers. Rules and regulations applicable to Registered Funds provide, in substance, that each investment advisory agreement between a fund and its investment adviser continues in effect from year to year only if its continuation is approved at least annually by the fund\u2019s board of trustees. Periodic review of fund advisory agreements could result in a reduction in our advisory fee revenues from Registered Funds. Fee reductions on existing or future strategies and services could have an adverse impact on our revenue and net income.\nThe inability to access clients through intermediaries could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to market investment strategies and services is highly dependent on access to registered investment advisors and the distribution systems of national and regional broker-dealer firms, which generally offer competing strategies and services that could limit the distribution of our offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain access to these intermediaries. Losing such access could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that existing or potential customers, including registered investment advisors and securities broker-dealers, decide to invest in or broaden distribution relationships with our competitors, the sales of our strategies and services, as well as our market share, revenue and net income, could decline. Certain intermediaries with which we conduct business charge us fees to maintain access to their distribution networks. If we choose not to pay such fees, our ability to distribute our strategies and services through those intermediaries would be limited.\nOur investment advisory agreements are subject to termination on short notice or non-renewal. We derive almost all of our revenue from management fees, distribution income and service fees received from managed funds and separate accounts. As a result, we are dependent upon management contracts, administrative contracts, distribution contracts, underwriting contracts and/or service contracts under which these fees are paid. Generally, these contracts are terminable upon 30 to 60 days\u2019 notice without penalty. If material contracts are terminated, not renewed or amended to reduce fees, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur assets under management, which affect revenue, are subject to significant fluctuations. Our major sources of revenue, including investment advisory, administrative, distribution and service fees, are generally calculated as percentages of assets under management. Fee rates for our investment strategies and services generally vary by investment mandate (e.g., equity, fixed income, floating-rate income, alternative, portfolio implementation or exposure management services) and investment vehicle (e.g., fund or separate account). An adverse change in asset mix by mandate or vehicle, independent of our level of assets under management, may result in a decrease in our overall average effective fee rate. Any decrease in the level of our assets under management generally would reduce our revenue and net income. Assets under management could decrease due to, among other things, a decline in securities prices, a decline in the sales of our investment offerings, an increase in open-end fund redemptions or client withdrawals, repurchases of, or other reductions in, closed-end fund shares outstanding, or reductions in leverage used by investment vehicles. Adverse market conditions and/or lack of investor confidence in the financial markets could lead to a decrease in investor risk tolerance. A decrease in investor risk tolerance could result in investors withdrawing from markets or decreasing their rate of investment, thereby reducing our overall assets under management and adversely affecting our revenue, earnings and growth prospects. Changes in investor risk tolerance could also result in investor allocation away from higher-fee strategies to lower-fee strategies, which could adversely affect our revenue and earnings. Our overall assets under management may not change in tandem with overall market conditions, as changes in our assets under management may lag improvements or declines in the overall market due to mix effects and investment performance.\nPoor investment performance of the assets we manage could affect our sales or reduce the amount of assets under management, adversely affecting revenue and net income. The performance of the assets we manage is critical to our success. Poor investment performance on an absolute basis or as compared to third-party benchmarks or competitors could lead to a decrease in sales and stimulate higher redemptions, thereby lowering the amount of assets under management and reducing the investment advisory fees we earn. A decline in investment performance of any investment franchise could have a material adverse effect on the level of assets under management, revenue and net income of that franchise. Past or present performance in the investment strategies we manage is not indicative of future performance.\nOur clients can withdraw the assets we manage on short notice, making our future client and revenue base unpredictable. Our open-end fund clients generally may redeem their investments in these funds each business day without prior notice. Institutional and individual separate account clients can terminate their relationships with us generally at any time. In a declining stock market, the pace of open-end fund redemptions and separate account withdrawals or terminations could accelerate. Poor performance of the assets we manage relative to other asset management firms could result in lower purchases and increased redemptions of open-end fund shares, and the loss of institutional and individual separate accounts. While not subject to daily redemption, closed-end funds that we advise may shrink in size due to repurchases of shares in open-market transactions or pursuant to tender offers, or in connection with distributions in excess of realized returns. Activist shareholders have through various means sought, and may continue to seek, to force certain closed-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser to conduct a share tender offer, convert to an open-end fund, liquidate or take other actions that would reduce or eliminate the fees we receive for managing such funds. A decrease in revenue that could result from any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe could be adversely affected by counterparty or client defaults. As we have seen in periods of significant market volatility, the deteriorating financial condition of a single financial institution may materially and adversely affect the performance of others. We, and the funds and accounts we manage, have exposure to many different counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties across the financial industry. We, and the funds and accounts we manage, may be exposed to credit, operational or other risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client, or in the event of other unrelated systemic market failures.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in global financial markets and adversely affected our business. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we experienced a decline in our assets under management, revenue and earnings due to market price declines and net outflows driven by investor uncertainty related to the pandemic. While financial markets and our flow trends have since substantially recovered, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to significantly affect the manner in which we operate our business. While we have in place business continuity plans that address potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to our personnel and our facilities, and technologies that enable our personnel to work effectively from home, no assurance can be given that the steps we have taken will continue to be effective or appropriate. While our employees have to date been able to continue conducting business while working remotely, operational challenges may arise in the future, which may reduce our organizational efficiency or effectiveness, and increase operational, compliance and cybersecurity risks. In addition, because most of our employees have not previously worked remotely for an extended period of time, we are unsure of the impact that the remote work environment and lack of in-person meetings with colleagues, clients and business partners will have on the growth of our business and the results of our operations over the long term. Many of the key service providers we rely on also have transitioned to working remotely. If we or they were to experience material disruptions in the ability of our or their employees to work remotely (e.g., from illness due to COVID-19 or disruption in internet-based communication systems and networks), our ability to operate our business could be materially adversely disrupted. Any such material adverse disruptions to our business operations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe extent to which our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial results are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the future will largely depend on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and the length of time until\nthe economy recovers and our employees can safely return to the workplace. In addition, many of the other risk factors described herein are heightened by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic conditions, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nFailure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede our productivity and ability to support business growth. Our infrastructure, including our technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the operations and competitiveness of our business. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of our business, including any expansion, could impede our productivity and growth, which could result in a decline in our earnings.\nFailure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on us and the investment strategies and services we offer. Significant portions of our business operations and those of our critical third-party service providers are concentrated in a few geographic areas, including Boston, Massachusetts and Seattle, Washington. Critical operations that are geographically concentrated in Boston and/or Seattle include trading operations, information technology, fund administration, and custody and portfolio accounting services for our investment offerings. Should we, or any of our critical service providers, experience a significant local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, our continued success will depend in part on the safety and availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. The failure by us, or any of our critical service providers, to maintain updated adequate business continuity plans, including backup facilities, could impede our ability to operate in the event of a disruption, which could cause our earnings to decline. We have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise, or that material disruptions will not occur. In addition, we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support, and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. If we, or any of our critical service providers, are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, we may be unable to continue our business operations, which could lead to a damaged reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management, lower revenues and reduced net income.\nWe have pursued growth in the United States and abroad in part through acquisitions, which exposes us to risks inherent in assimilating new operations, expanding into new jurisdictions and executing on new development opportunities. Our growth strategy has included the acquisition of asset management businesses that we believe will add value to our business and generate positive net returns. This strategy may not be effective, and failure to successfully develop and execute such a strategy may decrease earnings and harm our competitive position. We cannot guarantee that we will identify and consummate any such transactions on acceptable terms or have sufficient resources to accomplish such a strategy. In addition, any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks, including additional demands on our staff; unanticipated problems regarding integration of operating facilities, technologies and new employees; and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction. As a result, we may not be able to realize net benefits from such transactions. In addition, we may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that would otherwise be spent on the development of our business.\nExpansion into international markets and the introduction of new investment strategies and services increases our operational, regulatory and other risks. We continue to increase the scope of our investment offerings and the scale of our international business activities. As a result, we face increased operational, regulatory, compliance and reputational risks. The failure of our compliance and internal control systems to properly mitigate such additional risks, or of our operating infrastructure to support such expansion, could\nresult in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions. Our operations in the U.K., the E.U., Australia, Singapore and other jurisdictions are subject to significant compliance, disclosure and other obligations. We incur additional costs to satisfy the requirements of the E.U. Directive on UCITS and other E.U. directives (together, the E.U. Directives). Compliance requirements relating to the E.U. Directives may also limit our operating flexibility and affect our ability to expand in European markets. Activity in international markets also exposes us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of revenues, expenses and assets associated with our business activities outside the United States. Actual and anticipated changes in current exchange rates may also adversely affect international demand for our investment strategies and services, most of which represent investments primarily in U.S. dollar-based assets. Because certain of our costs to support international business activities are based in local currencies, the profitability of such activities in U.S. dollar terms may be adversely affected by a weakening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies in which we derive significant revenues.\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the E.U. (Brexit), with a transition period lasting until December 31, 2020. During the transition period, existing arrangements between the U.K. and the E.U. have remained in place while the U.K. and the E.U. seek to negotiate a free trade agreement that will govern the trading relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. following the transition period. The impact of Brexit on our business operations in the U.K. and Europe remains uncertain, and will vary depending on the future terms of trade between the U.K. and the E.U. Ongoing changes in the E.U.\u2019s regulatory framework applicable to our operations, including Brexit as well as any other changes in the composition of the E.U.\u2019s member states, may add additional complexity to our global operations, impede expansion and/or impose additional risks.\nWe may not manage risks associated with the replacement of financial benchmarks effectively. The withdrawal and replacement of widely used financial benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) with alternative benchmarks introduces a number of risks for us, our clients and the financial services industry more widely. These include legal implementation risks, as extensive changes to documentation for new and existing clients and transactions may be required; financial risks arising from any changes in the valuation of financial instruments linked to benchmarks; pricing risks, as changes to benchmarks could impact pricing mechanisms on some instruments; operational risks, due to the potential requirement to adapt information technology systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational processes; and relationship risks, relating to client communications and engagement during the transition away from LIBOR or other financial benchmarks currently utilized.\nThe FCA, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it has commitments from panel banks to continue to contribute to LIBOR through the end of calendar 2021, but that the FCA will not use its powers to compel contributions beyond that date. Accordingly, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of LIBOR beyond 2021. While it is not currently possible to determine precisely whether, or to what extent, the withdrawal and replacement of LIBOR would affect us, the implementation of alternative benchmark rates to LIBOR may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur success depends on key personnel, and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified portfolio managers, analysts, investment counselors, sales and management personnel, and other key professionals, including our executive officers. Our key employees generally do not have employment contracts and may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time. Certain senior executives and the non-employee members of our Board of Directors are subject to our mandatory retirement policy at age 65 and age 74, respectively. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon obtaining Eaton Vance Stockholder Approval (which approval was obtained on October 7, 2020), each share of our restricted stock\nand each restricted stock unit award that was then outstanding vested in full and was settled in unrestricted shares of our Non-Voting Common Stock. The accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards could result in key employee departures. The loss of the services of key personnel or our failure to attract replacement or additional qualified personnel could negatively affect our financial performance. An increase in compensation to attract or retain personnel could result in a decrease in net income.\nOur expenses are subject to fluctuations that could materially affect our operating results. Our results of operations are dependent on our level of expenses, which can vary significantly from period to period. Our expenses may fluctuate as a result of, among other things, variations in the level of compensation, expenses incurred to support distribution of our investment strategies and services, expenses incurred to develop new strategies and services, expenses incurred to enhance our technology, compliance and other infrastructure, impairments of intangible assets or goodwill, and the impact of inflation. Increases in our level of expenses, or our inability to reduce our level of expenses when necessary, could materially affect our operating results.\nOur business is subject to operational risk. We are subject to the risk that we commit management or administration errors that cause us to incur financial losses and damage our reputation. Our customized separate account and exposure management services businesses may be particularly susceptible to losses from operational or trading errors because they involve large numbers of accounts and operate at generally low fee rates. In addition, our operations are dependent upon services and information from third parties, and operations problems at such third parties could materially affect our business. Many of the risks described herein, including those related to operations, cyber security, business continuity, international operations and legal and regulatory developments, also apply to the activities of the third parties with which we do business.\nOur reputation could be damaged. We have built a reputation of high integrity, prudent investment management and superior client service. Our reputation is extremely important to our success. Any damage to our reputation could result in client withdrawals from funds or separate accounts that we manage and impede our ability to attract and retain key personnel. The loss of either client relationships or key personnel due to damage to our reputation could reduce the amount of assets we manage and cause us to suffer a loss in revenue and a reduction in net income. Increasingly, we must manage actual and potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client or our affiliates. Failure to adequately address or disclose actual and/or potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and business prospects.\nOur business may be negatively affected by adverse business decisions or our failure to properly implement or execute strategic programs and priorities. In order to maintain and grow our business, we must continuously make strategic decisions about our current and future business plans, including plans to target cost initiatives and enhance operational processes and efficiencies, to improve existing and to develop new service offerings and enhancements, to enter or exit business lines or geographic markets, to acquire or dispose of businesses, to build new systems, to migrate from existing systems and infrastructure, and to address staffing needs.\nSupport provided to developing new strategies and services may reduce fee income, increase expenses and expose us to potential loss on invested capital. We may support the development of new investment offerings by waiving all or a portion of the fees we receive, by subsidizing expenses or by making seed capital investments. Seed investments utilize Company capital that would otherwise be available for general corporate purposes and expose us to capital losses to the extent that realized investment losses are not offset by hedging gains. The risk of loss may be greater for seed capital investments that are not hedged, or if an\nintended hedge does not perform as expected. Failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support new investment offerings could have an adverse impact on our future growth.\nWe may need to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt in the future, and resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms. Significant future demands on our capital include contractual obligations to service our debt and satisfy the terms of non-cancellable operating leases as described more fully under Contractual Obligations in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 9 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we believe our existing liquid assets, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our current and forecasted operating cash needs, our ability to satisfy our long-term contractual obligations may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets. Our ability to access capital markets efficiently depends on a number of factors, including the state of global credit and equity markets, interest rates, credit spreads and our credit ratings. If we are unable to access capital markets to issue new debt, refinance existing debt or sell shares of our Non-Voting Common Stock as needed, or if we are unable to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe could be subject to losses and reputational harm if we, or our agents, fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information or as a result of cyber attacks. We are dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities, and those of third parties with which we do business, to protect our and their computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides in, or is transmitted through, such systems. As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients and employees as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity, including misappropriation of assets, fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data, is either prevented or detected on a timely basis. Nevertheless, all technology systems remain vulnerable to unauthorized access and may be corrupted by cyber attacks, computer viruses or other malicious software code, the nature of which threats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. In addition, authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information. Although we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our mobile electronic hardware, if such hardware is stolen, misplaced or left unattended, it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly actions by us. Breach or other failure of our technology systems, including those of third parties with which we do business, or failure to timely and effectively identify and respond to any such breach or failure, could result in the loss of valuable information, liability for stolen assets or information, remediation costs to repair damage caused by the incident, additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents and litigation costs resulting from the incident. In addition, our increased use of mobile and cloud technologies, including as a result of the shift to work-from-home arrangements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has heightened these and other operational risks, and any failure by our mobile or cloud technology service providers to adequately safeguard the systems we use and prevent or quickly detect and remediate cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential or propriety information. Moreover, the loss of confidential customer identification information could harm our reputation, result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers and subject us to liability under state, federal and international laws that protect confidential personal data, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenues and substantial penalties. In 2018, the E.U. significantly increased the potential penalties for noncompliance with requirements for the handling and maintenance of personal and sensitive data concerning customers and employees. Our failure to comply with these requirements could result in penalties of up to four percent of our global revenues, regulatory action and reputational risk. The recently enacted California\nConsumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, provides for enhanced consumer protections for California residents and statutory fines for data security breaches or other CCPA violations. Recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber attacks, and may in the future result in heightened cyber security requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers.\nRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Business\nLegal and regulatory developments affecting the investment industry could increase our regulatory costs and/or reduce our revenues. Our business is subject to complex and extensive regulation by various regulatory authorities in jurisdictions around the world. This regulatory environment may be altered without notice by new laws or regulations, revisions to existing regulations or new interpretations or guidance. Global financial regulatory reform initiatives may result in more stringent regulation, and changes in laws or regulations and their application to us could have a material adverse impact on our business, our profitability and mode of operations. In recent years, regulators in both the United States and abroad have increased oversight of the financial sector of the economy. Some of the newly adopted and proposed regulations are focused directly on the investment management industry, while others apply more broadly, but affect our industry. It is uncertain how regulatory trends will be affected by current and future political developments.\nUnder a final rule and interpretive guidance issued by FSOC, certain non-bank financial institutions have been designated for the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervision as SIFIs. Additional non-bank financial companies, which may include large asset management companies such as us, may be designated as SIFIs in the future. Currently, there are no non-bank financial companies with a SIFI designation. If we are designated a SIFI, we would be subject to enhanced prudential measures, which could include capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits, enhanced public disclosures and risk management requirements, annual stress testing by the Federal Reserve, credit exposure and concentration limits, supervisory and other requirements that could, individually, or in the aggregate, adversely affect our business and operations.\nEVM, Parametric and BMR are registered with the CFTC and the NFA as Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors; other subsidiaries of the Company claim exemptions from registration. The CFTC generally allows operators of registered mutual funds that are subject to registration as Commodity Pool Operators to comply with SEC disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping rules as the means of complying with CFTC\u2019s similar requirements. These CFTC rules do not, however, relieve registered Commodity Pool Operators from compliance with applicable anti-fraud provisions or certain performance reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The Company incurs ongoing costs associated with monitoring compliance with these requirements, including, but not limited to, CFTC and NFA registration and exemption obligations and the periodic reporting requirements of Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors.\nThe regulation of derivatives markets has undergone substantial change in recent years and such change may continue. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder require many derivatives to be cleared and traded on an exchange, expand entity registration requirements, impose business conduct requirements on counterparties and impose other regulatory requirements that will continue to change derivative markets as regulations are implemented. Additional regulation of the derivatives markets, including new Rule 18f-4 under the 1940 Act adopted in October 2020, may make the use of derivatives more costly, may limit the availability or reduce the liquidity of derivatives, and may impose limits or restrictions on the counterparties to derivative transactions.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are required to file quarterly reports on Form PF for private funds they manage, pursuant to systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by the SEC. These filings require significant investments in people and systems to ensure timely and accurate reporting. Further investment will be necessary as we implement rules adopted by the SEC in 2016 that amended Form ADV and established Form N-PORT to require additional reporting for the separate accounts and Registered Funds we manage, respectively.\nIn Europe, the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II Directive) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) (collectively, MiFID II) took effect in January 2018. Implementation of MiFID II significantly affects the structure and operation of the E.U. financial markets and our European operations. Some of the main changes introduced by MiFID II include: (1) enhancing business conduct and governance requirements; (2) broadening the scope of pre- and post-trade transparency; (3) enhancing disclosure requirements; (4) increasing transaction reporting requirements; (5) revising the relationship between client commissions and investment research services; and (6) further regulating trading revenue.\nAll of these new and developing laws and regulations have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, greater compliance and administrative burdens on us, increasing our expenses.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws. Changes in U.S. tax policy may affect us to a greater degree than many of our competitors because we manage significant assets in funds and separate accounts with an after-tax return objective. Future changes in tax laws, including as a result of changes proposed by the new incoming Presidential administration, or tax rulings could also materially affect our effective tax rate. In particular, the reduction in the corporate income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted into U.S. law in December 2017 (2017 Tax Act) could be reduced or rescinded by future tax law changes. While increasing our effective tax rate, an increase in future tax rates would also cause the carrying value of our deferred tax assets at the time of enactment to be increased.\nExposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, including several states. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, which could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOur business is subject to risk from legal and regulatory proceedings. We are subject to federal securities laws, state laws regarding securities fraud, other federal and state laws and rules, and regulations of certain regulatory, self-regulatory and other organizations, including, among others, the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the NFA and the New York Stock Exchange. We are also subject to substantial legal and regulatory requirements in the U.K., E.U., Singapore, Japan and other jurisdictions in which we operate outside the U.S. While we have focused significant attention and resources on the development and implementation of compliance policies, procedures and practices, non-compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations, either in the U.S. or abroad, or our inability to adapt to a complex and ever-changing regulatory environment could result in sanctions against us, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, revenue and earnings. From time to time, various claims or potential claims against us arise, including employment-related claims.\nWe carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. We cannot guarantee that our insurance will cover most liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed, or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need\nto assume higher deductibles or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Non-Voting Common Stock\nOur Non-Voting Common Stock lacks voting rights. Our Non-Voting Common Stock has no voting rights under any circumstances. All voting power resides with our Voting Common Stock, all shares of which are held by officers of the Company and its subsidiaries. All the shares of our Voting Common Stock are deposited in a voting trust (Voting Trust) in exchange for Voting Trust Receipts that entitle the holder to receive the dividends paid on the Voting Common Stock he or she has deposited. As of October 31, 2020, there were 25 holders of Voting Trust Receipts representing Voting Common Stock, each holder of which is a Voting Trustee of the Voting Trust. Holders of Non-Voting Common Stock should understand that such ownership interests have no ability to vote in the election of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and no right to direct the Company\u2019s management and strategy. On October 7, 2020, the Voting Trust approved and adopted the Merger Agreement under which Morgan Stanley has agreed to acquire the Company, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions. The exclusion of our Non-Voting Common Stock from stock market indexes, whether as a result of our dual-class capitalization or any other reason, could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our Non-Voting Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 31500, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "EV"}
