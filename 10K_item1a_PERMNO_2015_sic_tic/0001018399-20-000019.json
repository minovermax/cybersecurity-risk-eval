{"cik": "1018399", "company": "ENTERPRISE BANCORP INC /MA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nAn investment in the Company's common stock is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, those set forth below, any of which could cause the Company's actual results to vary materially from recent results or from the other forward-looking statements that the Company may make from time to time in news releases, periodic reports and other written or oral communications. This annual report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRealization of any of the risks outlined in the following sections, or additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of, or may deem immaterial, may impair the Company's business in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, any one or a combination of the following consequences: loss of assets; an interruption in the ability to conduct transactions; loss of\ncustomer business; loss of key personnel; additional regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions and/or penalties against the Company or the Bank; limit the payment of dividends; damage the Company's reputation; expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability; result in unanticipated charges against capital; increase operational costs; decrease revenue; restrict funding sources, which could adversely impact the Company's ability to meet cash needs; be required to liquidate investments or other assets; limit growth; close locations or reduce staffing; or limit permissible activities. As a result, the Company's overall business, financial condition, results of operations, capital position, liquidity position, and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Company's common stock could decline significantly, and stockholders could lose some or all their investment.\nThe material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect the Company are outlined below. These risks and uncertainties are not listed in any order of priority and are not necessarily the only ones facing the Company.\nRISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS\nRisk Management Controls and Procedures Could Fail or Be Circumvented\nManagement regularly reviews and updates the Company's internal controls, corporate governance policies, compensation policies, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and security controls to prevent and detect errors, theft, fraud or robbery from both internal and external sources. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. The Company is at risk of any circumvention of the Company's internal controls and procedures, whether intentional or unintentional, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, or failure to adequately document executed controls and procedures, or a physical theft or robbery, whether by employees, management, directors, or external elements, or any illegal activity conducted by a Bank customer or employee.\nSee also \u201cRisk Management Framework,\u201d contained above in Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's operational risk management, information security and technology practices, the Company's Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan and third-party risk management.\nLENDING\nThere are inherent risks associated with the Company's lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in the economic conditions in the market areas in which the Company operates and changes in interest rates. In addition, the Company may be impacted by the following risks associated with its lending activities:\nCommercial Lending Generally Involves a Higher Degree of Risk than Retail Residential Mortgage Lending\nThe Company's loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and commercial construction loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than owner-occupied residential real estate loans or consumer loans, and typically have larger balances. The underlying commercial real estate values, the actual costs necessary to complete a construction project, or customer cash flow and payment expectations on such loans can be more easily influenced by adverse conditions in the related industries, the real estate market or in the economy in general and are dependent on the skills and experience of the business' management team.\nThe Company May Need to Increase its Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and non-performing trends, all of which may undergo material changes. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company's allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that may differ from those of the Company's management.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted CECL which will impact the way all banking organizations estimate their allowance for loan losses.\nSee Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Item (v) \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K below, under the section \u201cAccounting pronouncements not yet adopted by the Company\u201d for further information regarding Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d\nIncreases in the Company's Non-performing Assets Could Adversely Affect the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition in the Future\nNon-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. No interest income is recorded on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting income and returns on assets and equity. In addition, loan administration and workout costs increase, including significant time commitments from management and staff, resulting in additional reductions of earnings. When taking collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, the Company is required to carry the property or loan at its then-estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell, which, when compared to the carrying value of the loan, may result in a loss. In addition, any errors in documentation or previously unknown defects in deeds may impact the Company's ability to perfect title of the collateral in foreclosure. These non-performing loans and other real estate owned assets also increase the Company's risk profile and the capital that regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks and have an impact on the Company's FDIC risk-based deposit insurance premium rate.\nThe Company's Use of Appraisals in Deciding Whether to Make a Loan Does Not Ensure the Value of the Collateral\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property or other business assets, the sale of which may provide ultimate recovery of the outstanding balance of the loan, the Company generally requires an internal evaluation or independent appraisal of the collateral supporting the loan. However, these assessment methods are only an estimate of the value of the collateral at the time the assessment is made and involve estimates and assumptions. An error in fact, estimate or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of the valuation. Furthermore, changes in those estimates due to the economic environment and events occurring after the initial assessment, may cause the value of the collateral to differ significantly from the initial valuations. As a result, the value of collateral securing a loan may be less than estimated at the time of assessment, and if a default occurs the Company may not recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nThe Company is Subject to Environmental Risks Associated with Real Estate Held as Collateral or Occupied\nWhen a borrower defaults on a loan secured by real property, the Company may purchase the property in foreclosure or accept a deed to the property surrendered by the borrower. The Company may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans. The Company also occupies owned and leased premises where branches and other bank facilities are located. While the Company\u2019s lending, foreclosure and facilities policies and guidelines are intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination, hazardous substances could exist on some of the properties that the Company may own, acquire, manage or occupy. Environmental laws could force the Company to clean up the properties at the Company\u2019s expense. It may cost much more to clean a property than the property is worth, and it may be difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties. The Company could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower\u2019s operations if the Company takes a role in managing those operations after a default.\nConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Loans are Subject to Heightened Risk Management and Regulatory Review\nIf a concentration in commercial real estate lending is present, as measured under government banking regulations, management must employ heightened risk management lending practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, portfolio risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. If a concentration is determined to exist, the Company may incur additional operating expenses in order to comply with additional risk management practices and increased capital requirements.\nSee also \u201cLoans,\u201d including the subsections \u201cCredit Risk,\u201d and \u201cAsset Quality,\u201d included in the section entitled \u201cFinancial Condition,\u201d contained in Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's commercial loan portfolio and credit risk.\nECONOMICS & FINANCIAL MARKETS\nThe Company's Profitability Depends Significantly on Economic Conditions in the Company's Primary Market Areas\nThe Company's financial results are impacted by the general economic conditions of the primary market areas in which the Company operates. Any weakening in general economic conditions in the New England region, or any long-term deterioration of the regional economy could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company's Investment Portfolio Could Incur Losses or Fair Value Could Deteriorate\nThere are inherent risks associated with the Company's investment activities. These risks include the impact from changes in interest rates, weakness in real estate, municipalities, government sponsored enterprises, or other industries, the impact of changes in income tax rates on the value of tax-exempt securities, adverse changes in regional or national economic conditions, and general turbulence in domestic and foreign financial markets, among other things. If an investment's value\nis deemed other-than-temporarily impaired, then the Company is required to write down the fair value of the debt security which may involve a charge to earnings. These conditions could adversely impact the ultimate collectability of the Company's investments.\nThe Company is Subject to Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company's earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income, meaning the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates could negatively impact the demand for bank products and adversely impact earnings. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company's control, including monetary policy of the U.S. federal government, inflation and deflation, volatility of domestic and global financial markets, including credit markets, and competition. In addition, certain assets may have interest rate caps and floors, which restrict the level of interest rate movement that the Company can impose.\nUncertainty related to the London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\") and its replacement\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after December 31, 2021. The Federal Reserve Board and the New York Federal Reserve Bank have jointly formed a committee known as the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \"ARRC\") to help ensure a successful transition from LIBOR. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the ARRC has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as the alternative rate for use in derivatives and other financial contracts currently being indexed to LIBOR. SOFR is a daily index of the interest rate banks and hedge funds pay to borrow money overnight, secured by U.S. Treasury securities. Currently no forward-looking term index (like LIBOR) yet exists and the development of a SOFR-based term rate is ongoing. Historically, SOFR has been lower than LIBOR because it does not take into account bank credit risk. Accordingly, a credit spread adjustment is being considered. Since the proposed SOFR is calculated differently than LIBOR, payments under contracts referencing the new rates may differ from those referencing LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool, and the future of LIBOR is still uncertain.\nA relatively small portion of the Company's assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR and the transition to an alternative rate is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's earnings.\nSee also \u201cImpairment Review of Investment Securities,\u201d included in the section entitled \u201cAccounting Policies/Critical Accounting Estimates,\u201d contained in Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of this Form 10-K, Item (d), \u201cRestricted Cash and Investments\u201d and Item (e), \u201cInvestments,\u201d included in Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Account Policies,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K below. See Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\u201d of this Form 10-K for further discussions related to the Company's management of interest-rate risk.\nLIQUIDITY\nDeposit Outflows May Increase Reliance on Borrowings and Brokered Deposits as Sources of Funds\nThe Company has traditionally funded asset growth principally through deposits and borrowings. As a general matter, deposits are typically a lower cost source of funds than external wholesale funding (e.g., brokered deposits and borrowed funds), because interest rates paid for deposits are typically less than interest rates charged for wholesale funding. If the balance of the Company's deposits decreases relative to the Company's overall banking operations, the Company may have to rely more heavily on wholesale funding or other sources of external funding or may have to increase deposit rates to maintain deposit levels in the future.\nSources of External Funding Could Become Restricted and Impact the Company's Liquidity\nIf, as a result of general economic conditions or other events, sources of external funding become restricted or are eliminated, the Company may not be able to raise adequate funds, or may incur substantially higher funding costs in order to raise the necessary funds to support the Company's operations and growth, or may be required to restrict operations or the payment of dividends.\nSee also \u201cOther Sources of Funds,\u201d contained in Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d of this Form 10-K and \u201cLiquidity,\u201d included in the section entitled \u201cFinancial Condition,\u201d contained in Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's sources of contingent liquidity.\nTECHNOLOGY & INFORMATION SYSTEMS\nThe Company is Subject to Technology Related Risk\nThe use of technology related products, services, delivery channels, access points and processes expose the Company to various risks, particularly operational, privacy, cybersecurity, strategic, reputation and compliance risk. Banks are required to prudently manage technology-related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies by identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks associated with the use of technology.\nFailure to Keep Pace with Technological Change Could Affect the Company's Profitability\nThe banking industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products, services and delivery channels. Failure to successfully plan or keep pace with technological changes affecting the banking industry, or failure to adequately train and educate staff and customers on the use and risks of new technologies, or failure to comply adequately with regulatory guidance regarding protection of information security systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and, in turn, the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there may be significant time and expenses associated with upgrading and implementing new technology, technology compliance and information security processes.\nInformation Systems Could Experience an Interruption, Failure, Breach in Security, or Cyber-Attack\nThe Company relies heavily on public utilities infrastructures and internal information and operating systems to conduct its business, and these systems could fail in a variety of ways. In addition, the use of networked operating systems exposes the Company to the increased sophistication and activity of cyber-criminals. A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information resources of the Company. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access directly to our information systems, or indirectly through our vendors and customers systems, for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential corporate information or customers' Personally Identifiable Financial Information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The Company's independent third-party service providers or their subcontractors may also have access to customers' personal information and therefore also expose the Company to cybersecurity risk. Additionally, vendors' and customers' home, business or mobile information systems are at risk of fraudulent corporate account takeovers which the Company may not be able to detect. There is no guarantee the Company's counter-actions will be successful or that the Company will have the resources or technical expertise to anticipate, detect or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks.\nThe occurrence of any failures or disruptions of infrastructure, or breakdown, breach, failures or interruptions of the Company's information systems, access points (or those of third-party service providers and customers), or the Company's inability to detect, respond, disclose and correct such occurrence or infiltration in a timely manner, could result in an interruption in our ability to conduct transactions for an indeterminable length of time, could expose customers' personal information to unauthorized parties, increase the risk of fraud or customer identity theft, subject the Company to increased operational costs to detect and rectify the situation, damage the Company's reputation and deter customers from using the Company's services, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, and expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nOPERATIONS\nThe Company Operates in a Competitive Industry and Market Area\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, several of which are larger and have more financial resources than the Company. Competitors within the Company's market area include national, regional, other community banks, internet based banks and credit unions, and various types of other non-bank financial institutions, including, consumer finance companies, mortgage brokers and lenders, private lenders, insurance companies, securities brokerage firms, institutional mutual funds, registered investment advisors, other financial intermediaries and non-bank electronic payment and funding channels. The evolving Fintech industry also aims to compete with traditional banking services, and delivery methods, although the industry offers opportunities for strategic partnerships, it is also a source for direct competition. Some of these competitors are not subject to the same degree of government regulation as the Company and thus may have a competitive advantage over the Company. If due to the inability to compete successfully within the Company's target banking markets, the Company encounters difficulties attracting and retaining customers it would have a material adverse effect on the Company's growth and profitability.\nThe Company May Experience a Prolonged Interruption in its Ability to Conduct Business\nThe Company relies heavily on its personnel and facilities to conduct its business. A material loss of people or core\noperating facilities, for any number of reasons including natural disasters or pandemics, could result in interruptions in customer services and our ability to conduct transactions, loss of customer business and damage the Company's reputation.\nThe Company Relies on External Service Providers\nThe Company relies on independent third-party firms, including indirect vendors utilized by such third parties, to provide critical services necessary to conducting its business. These services include but are not limited to: electronic funds delivery networks; check clearing houses; electronic banking services; wealth advisory, management and custodial services; wealth brokerage services; correspondent banking services; information security assessments and technology support services; and loan underwriting and review services. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions of the independent firms' systems or in their delivery of services, or failure to perform in accordance with contracted service level agreements, for any number of reasons could also impact the Company's ability to conduct business and process transactions.\nThe Company Relies on Financial Counterparty Relationships\nThe Company routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, in order to maintain correspondent bank relationships, liquidity, manage certain loan participations, mortgage sales activities, interest-rate swaps, engage in securities transactions, and engage in other financial activities with counterparties that are customary to our industry. Many of these transactions expose the Company to counterparty credit, liquidity and/or reputation risk in the event of default by the counterparty, or negative publicity or public complaints, whether real or perceived, about one or more of the Company's financial counterparties, or the financial services industry in general. Although the Company seeks to manage these risks through internal controls and procedures, the Company may experience loss or interruption of business, damage to its reputation, or incur additional costs or liabilities as a result of unforeseen events with these counterparties.\nInvestment Management Practices and Aggregate Assets Under Management Expose the Company to Financial, Operational and Legal Risk\nThe Company's Enterprise Wealth Management and Enterprise Wealth Services channels derive their revenues primarily from investment management fees based on assets under management. The Company's ability to maintain or increase investment assets under management is subject to a number of factors, including changes in client investment preferences, investment decisions by us or our third party service provider partners, and various economic conditions, among other factors. Wealth management and wealth services clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce their aggregate assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons. Investment performance is one of the most important factors in retaining existing clients and competing for new wealth management clients. Financial markets are affected by many factors, any of which could adversely impact the fair value of customer portfolios. Even when market conditions are generally favorable, our investment performance may be adversely affected by the investment style of our wealth management and investment advisors and the investment decisions that they make.\nAny decrease in assets under management, could reduce related fee income. Poor investment performance, whether real or perceived, in either relative or absolute terms, could impair our ability to attract and retain funds from existing and new clients, damage the company\u2019s reputation and expose the Company to litigation and possible financial liability, among other factors.\nThe Company's Insurance Coverage May Not be Adequate to Prevent Additional Liabilities or Expenses\nThe Company works with an independent third-party insurance advisor to obtain insurance policies that provide coverage for a variety of business risks at coverage levels that compare favorably to bench-marked coverage for loss exposures that are faced by similarly sized financial institutions. However, there is no guarantee that the circumstances of an incident will meet the criteria for insurance coverage under a specific policy, and despite the insurance policies in place the Company may experience a loss incident or event which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nSlower than Expected Growth in New Branches and Products Could Adversely Affect the Company's Profitability\nThe Company has placed a strategic emphasis on expanding the Bank's branch network and market share through organic growth within existing and into neighboring geographic markets. However, in the future the Company could explore growth opportunities through acquisition of other banks, financial services companies or lines of business. New branches and new products and services require a significant investment of both financial and personnel resources. Lower or slower than expected loan and deposit growth in new branches and/or lower than expected fee or other income generated from new branches could decrease anticipated revenues, increase costs and reduce net income generated by such investments.\nAny potential future acquisitions could adversely affect the Company's profitability based on management's ability to successfully complete such acquisitions and integration of the acquired businesses and increase the risk of losing key employees and customers. In addition, branch openings, relocations, and closings require the approval of various state and federal regulatory agencies, which may or may not approve the Company's application for a branch. Adding new branches in existing or new market areas could also divert resources from current core operations and thereby further adversely affect the Company's growth and profitability.\nThe Company May Not be Able to Attract, Retain or Develop Key Personnel\nThe Company's success and growth strategy depends, in large part, on its ability to attract, retain and develop top performing banking professional within our markets, and its ability to successfully identify and develop personnel for succession to key executive management positions and to the board of directors. The inability to do so could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of the Company's market, years of industry or business experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements.\nSee the section entitled \u201cCompetition,\u201d contained in Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the competitive issues facing the Company.\nREGULATION\nThe Company is Subject to Extensive Government Regulation and Supervision\nThe Company and the Bank are also subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations that are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, the FDIC insurance fund and the banking system as a whole, not the interests of stockholders. These regulations, including bank regulatory reform, tax policy and corporate governance rules, affect the Company's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, growth, and net income, among other things. Federal and state laws and regulations may not always align in principle or statue, and preemptive federal laws may be more or less restrictive than those of a state. The Company cannot predict what legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions.\nSee also the section entitled \u201cSupervision and Regulation,\u201d contained in Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the supervisory and regulatory issues facing the Company and the Bank.\nESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe Company's Financial Condition and Results of Operation Rely in Part on Management Estimates and Assumptions\nIn preparing the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, estimates and assumptions to be utilized. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and income and expenses for the years then ended. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing change in the economic environment and other factors will be reflected in the financial statements and results of operations in future periods. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and be adversely affected should the assumptions and estimates used be incorrect or change over time due to changes in circumstances. The three most significant areas in which management applies critical assumptions and estimates are the estimates of the allowance for loan losses, impairment review of investment securities and the impairment review of goodwill.\nThe Net Deferred Tax Assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) May be Determined to be Unrealizable in Future Periods\nIn making its assessment on the future realizability of net DTAs, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income, and recoverable past income tax paid. If in the future, management believes based upon historical and expected future earnings that it is more likely than not that the Company will not generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the DTA balance, then a valuation allowance would be booked against the DTA, with the write down offset to current earnings. Factors beyond management's control can affect future levels of taxable income and there can be no assurances that sufficient taxable income will be generated to fully realize the DTAs in the future.\nSee also \u201cAccounting Policies/Critical Accounting Estimates,\u201d contained in Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of this Form 10-K for further information regarding significant areas that\nmanagement applies estimates and assumptions and Item (v), \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements,\u201d included in Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Account Policies,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K below.\nREPUTATION\nDamage to the Company's Reputation Could Affect the Company's Profitability and Stockholders' Value\nThe Company is dependent on its reputation within its market area as a trusted and responsible financial company for all aspects of its business with customers, employees, vendors, third-party service providers, and others with whom the Company conducts business or potential future business. Any negative publicity or public complaints, whether real or perceived, disseminated by word of mouth, by the general media, by electronic or social networking means, or by other methods, could harm the Company's reputation.\nThe Company is Exposed to Legal Claims and Litigation\nThe Company is subject to legal challenges under a variety of circumstances in the course of its normal business practices. Regardless of the scope or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in litigation that could be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company's operations, and distracting to management. Whether claims or legal action are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability, damage the Company's reputation, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and restrictions, and/or adversely affect the market perception of our products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services.\nCOMMON STOCK, STOCKHOLDER\u2019S EQUITY, CAPITAL\nThe Trading Volume in the Company's Common Stock is Less Than That of Larger Companies\nAlthough the Company's common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, the trading volume in the Company's common stock is substantially less than that of larger companies. Given the lower trading volume of the Company's common stock, significant purchases or sales of the Company's common stock, or the expectation of such purchases or sales, could cause significant movement in the Company's stock price.\nThe Market Price of the Company's Common Stock Could be Affected by General Industry Issues\nThe banking industry may be more affected than other industries by certain economic, credit, regulatory or information security issues. Although the Company itself may or may not be directly impacted by such issues, the Company's stock price may move up or down due to the influence, both real and perceived, of these issues, among others, on the banking industry in general. Investment in the Company's stock is not insured against loss by the FDIC or any other public or private entity.\nStockholder Dilution Could Occur if Additional Stock is Issued in the Future\nIf the Company's Board should determine in the future that there is a need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of the Company's common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, or if the Board decides to grant additional stock awards or options for the purchase of shares of common stock, the issuance of such additional shares, stock awards and/or the issuance of additional shares upon the exercise of such options would expose existing stockholders' ownership interest to dilution.\nThe Company's Capital Levels Could Fall Below Regulatory Minimums\nIf the Company's regulatory capital levels decline, or if regulatory requirements increase, and the Company is unable to raise additional capital to offset that decline or meet the increased requirements, then its regulatory capital ratios may fall below regulatory minimum capital adequacy levels.\nThe Company's failure to remain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, restrict the Company's ability to grow (both assets and branching activity), increase the Company's costs of funds and FDIC insurance expense, prohibit the Company's ability to pay dividends on common shares, and restrict its ability to make acquisitions, among other impacts. Under FDIC rules, if the Bank ceases to be a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution, its ability to accept brokered deposits and the interest rates that it pays may be restricted.\nThe Company's Articles of Organization, By-Laws and Stockholders Rights Plan as Well as Certain Banking and Corporate Laws Could Have an Anti-Takeover Effect\nAlthough management believes that certain anti-takeover strategies are in the best interest of the Company and its\nstockholders, provisions of the Company's articles of organization, by-laws, and stockholders rights plan and certain federal and state banking laws and state corporate laws, including regulatory approval requirements for any acquisition of control of the Company, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Company's stockholders. The combination of these provisions is intended to prohibit a non-negotiated merger, or other business combination involving an acquisition of the Company, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock.\nDirectors and Executive Officers Own a Significant Portion of Common Stock\nThe Company's directors and executive officers, as a group, beneficially own approximately 17% of the Company's outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019. Management views this ownership commitment by insiders as an integral component of maintaining the Company's local and community-based ownership. However, as a result of this combined ownership interest, the directors and executive officers have the ability, if they vote their shares in a like manner, to significantly influence the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors.\nThe Company Relies on Dividends from the Bank for Substantially All of its Revenue\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, and if declared by our Board. Although the Company has historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so, and our Board may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.\nThe Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. It receives substantially all its revenue from dividends paid by the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds used to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock and interest and principal on the Company\u2019s subordinated debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company, and certain regulators may prohibit the Bank or the Company from paying future dividends if deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. If the Bank, due to its capital position, inadequate net income levels, or otherwise, is unable to pay dividends to the Company, then the Company will be unable to service its debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nSee the sections entitled \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d and \u201cCapital Resources,\u201d contained in Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements for the Company and the Bank. See also the section entitled \u201cDividends,\u201d contained in Item 5, \u201cMarket for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d of this Form 10-K below.", "PERMNO": 90590, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "EBTC"}
