{"cik": "88121", "company": "SEABOARD CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nA description of factors that could materially affect Seaboard\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition is provided below.\nIndustry Risks\n(1) Seaboard\u2019s Operations Are Subject to the General Risks of the Food Industry. The food products manufacturing industry is subject to the risks posed by:\n\u25cf food spoilage;\n\u25cf food contamination, including contamination caused by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, pathogenic E coli and aflatoxin;\n\u25cf food allergens;\n\u25cf evolving consumer preferences and nutritional and health-related concerns;\n\u25cf international, federal, state and local food processing regulations;\n\u25cf consumer product liability claims;\n\u25cf product recall;\n\u25cf product tampering; and\n\u25cf public perception of food production practices, including handling of production and live animals.\nPathogens which may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and therefore may be present in Seaboard\u2019s products. These pathogens also can be introduced to its products as a result of improper\nhandling by customers or consumers. Seaboard does not have control over handling procedures once products have been shipped for distribution. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, Seaboard\u2019s revenues could decrease, costs of doing business could increase, and Seaboard\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected.\n(2) Ocean Transportation Has Inherent Risks. Seaboard\u2019s owned and chartered vessels along with related cargoes are at risk of being damaged, lost or incurring excess cost because of events such as:\n\u25cf inclement weather;\n\u25cf mechanical failures;\n\u25cf grounding, fire, explosions and collisions;\n\u25cf human error;\n\u25cf war, piracy and terrorism; and\n\u25cf port access.\nAny of these hazards could result in death or injury to persons, loss of property, environmental damages, delays or rerouting. If one of Seaboard\u2019s vessels were involved in an incident, the resulting negative public perception could have a material adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, many aspects of the shipping industry are subject to extensive governmental regulations. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes, while the failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions, the suspension or termination of Seaboard\u2019s operations or detention of its vessels.\n(3) Fluctuations in Fuel Costs Could Adversely Affect Operating Margins. Fuel expenses are a large expense for the Marine segment and also impacts the CT&M segment\u2019s results. Fuel prices can vary greatly from year to year. While such fluctuations may be offset through fuel surcharges or other mechanisms, such mechanisms do not act with precision in terms of timing and amount and may not adjust revenues enough to offset the increase in costs.\nMacro Operation Risks\n(1) International Operations Subject Seaboard to Risks That Could Have a Significant Impact on Seaboard\u2019s Business. Seaboard is a diverse agribusiness and transportation company with global operations in several industries. Most of the sales and costs of Seaboard\u2019s segments are significantly influenced by worldwide fluctuations in commodity prices or changes in foreign political and economic conditions. Accordingly, revenues, operating income and cash flows could fluctuate significantly from year to year. In addition, Seaboard\u2019s international activities pose risks not faced by companies that limit themselves to U.S. markets. These risks include:\n\u25cf changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange controls;\n\u25cf changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u25cf hyperinflation;\n\u25cf heightened customer credit and execution risk;\n\u25cf border restrictions, tariffs, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u25cf closing of borders by foreign countries to the import of products due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues;\n\u25cf changes in tax laws;\n\u25cf legal and regulatory structures and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and any lawsuits that may arise;\n\u25cf negative perception within a foreign country of a U.S. company doing business in that foreign country;\n\u25cf compliance with laws and regulations for conducting international business such as Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations;\n\u25cf expropriation, civil unrest and government instability; and\n\u25cf inconsistent application or enforcement of local laws, including tax laws.\n(2) Deterioration of Economic Conditions Could Negatively Impact Seaboard\u2019s Business. Seaboard\u2019s business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates (including the LIBOR phase out), availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs, impacts caused by pandemics and other public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Any such changes could adversely affect the demand for and production of Seaboard\u2019s meat products, grains, shipping services and other products, or the cost and availability of needed raw materials and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting Seaboard\u2019s financial results. If economic or market conditions in key global markets deteriorate, Seaboard may experience material adverse effects on its business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, Seaboard is monitoring the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already caused significant disruption to global financial markets and supply chains in 2020. The significance of the operational and financial impact to Seaboard in 2021 and after will depend on future\ndevelopments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The national and global economic conditions, could, among other things:\n\u25cf impair the financial condition of some of Seaboard\u2019s customers and suppliers, thereby increasing customer bad debts or non-performance by customers and suppliers;\n\u25cf negatively impact global demand for protein and grain-based products, which could result in a reduction of revenues, operating income and cash flows;\n\u25cf decrease the value of Seaboard\u2019s investments in equity and debt securities, including pension plan assets, causing losses that would adversely impact Seaboard\u2019s net earnings; and\n\u25cf impair the financial viability of Seaboard\u2019s insurers.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\n(1) Seaboard\u2019s Common Stock Is Thinly Traded and Subject to Daily Price Fluctuations. The common stock of Seaboard is closely held and thinly traded on a daily basis on the NYSE American. Seaboard Flour LLC and SFC Preferred, LLC, which are beneficially owned by the Bresky family, hold approximately 77% of Seaboard\u2019s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, the price of a share of Seaboard common stock could fluctuate more significantly from day-to-day than that of a share of more widely held stock that is actively traded on a daily basis.\n(2) Decentralization May Present Certain Risks. Seaboard\u2019s operations are relatively decentralized in comparison with its peers. While Seaboard executive management believes this practice enables it to remain responsive to risks, opportunities and to customers\u2019 needs, it necessarily places significant control and decision-making powers in the hands of local management. This presents various risks, including the risk that executive management may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting a key business than in a more centralized environment. In addition, it means that Seaboard may be slower to detect compliance related problems (e.g., a rogue employee undertaking activities that are prohibited by applicable law or Seaboard\u2019s internal policies) and that \u201ccompany-wide\u201d business initiatives, such as the integration of disparate information technology systems, are often more challenging and costly to implement, and their risk of failure higher, than they would be in a more centralized environment. Depending on the nature of the problem or initiative in question, such failure could materially adversely affect Seaboard\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n(3) Seaboard Has Investments in Non-Consolidated Affiliates That Are Managed by Third Parties. Seaboard has several equity method investments in which it owns 50% or less, with various third-party business partners owning the remaining equity. Due to the ownership structure of these affiliates, Seaboard does not control all of the decision making processes and could be exposed to various business risks if the business partners\u2019 business decisions do not align with Seaboard\u2019s best interests, which could adversely impact the results for Seaboard\u2019s income (loss) from affiliates.\n(4) Seaboard Is Increasingly Dependent on Information Technology Systems to Manage and Support a Variety of Business Processes and Activities. Seaboard may be adversely impacted if it is unable to protect its information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber-attacks or cybersecurity breaches. Seaboard may also be adversely impacted if third parties on whom Seaboard relies are unable to similarly protect their information technology systems. Attempted cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Any significant penetration, invasion, destruction, or interruption of these systems could negatively impact operations and there is a risk of business interruption and reputational damage from the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and a risk of loss to financial assets related to manipulated electronic communications. This includes additional costs for increased security, system remediation and breach detection. If Seaboard is unable to prevent such breaches or failures or if a third party on whom Seaboard relies is unable to prevent such breaches or failures, Seaboard\u2019s operations could be disrupted or it could negatively impact Seaboard\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and the market price of its common stock.\n(5) Seaboard\u2019s Operations are Subject to the General Risks of Litigation. Seaboard is involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers, shareholders, or injured persons, and claims relating to product liability, contract disputes, antitrust regulations, intellectual property, advertising, labeling, wage and hour laws, employment practices or environmental matters. Neither litigation trends nor the outcomes of litigation can be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could negatively affect Seaboard\u2019s financial results.\nSpecific Pork Segment Risks\n(1) Fluctuations in Commodity Pork Prices Could Adversely Affect the Results of Operations. Sales prices for this segment\u2019s products are directly affected by both domestic and worldwide supply and demand for pork products and other proteins, all of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand as well as other factors over which Seaboard has little to no control. Commodity pork prices demonstrate a cyclical nature over periods\nof years, reflecting changes in the supply of fresh pork and competing proteins on the market, especially beef and chicken. This segment\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by fluctuations in pork commodity prices.\n(2) Increases in Costs of This Segment\u2019s Feed Components and Third-Party Hog Purchases Could Adversely Affect Costs and Operating Margins. Feed costs are the most significant single component of the cost of raising hogs and could be materially affected by commodity price fluctuations for corn and soybean meal. The results of this segment could be negatively affected by increased costs of its feed components. The increase in exports and continued operation of ethanol plants has elevated this risk as it has increased the demand for feed ingredients. Approximately 15% of this segment\u2019s slaughtered hogs are purchased from third parties, and commodity price fluctuations for hogs could have an impact on this segment\u2019s total costs. The cost and supply of feed components and the third-party hogs that this segment purchases are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand, which are driven by matters over which Seaboard has no control, including weather, current and projected worldwide grain stocks and prices, grain export prices, subsidies and tariffs, and governmental agricultural policies. This segment attempts to manage certain of these risks through the use of commodity derivatives; however, this may also limit its ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations. Unless wholesale pork prices correspondingly increase, increases in the prices of this segment\u2019s feed components or in the cost of third-party hogs purchased would adversely affect Seaboard\u2019s operating margins.\n(3) Seaboard May Be Unable to Obtain and Retain Appropriate Personnel. The nature of the work and remote locations of the pork processing plant and live hog operations, along with a more restrictive national policy on immigration, have affected and could continue to negatively affect the availability and cost of labor. This segment is dependent on having a sufficient number of properly trained operations personnel. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel is important to this segment\u2019s success. The inability to acquire and retain the services of such personnel could have a material adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s operations.\n(4) The Loss of This Segment\u2019s Oklahoma Pork Processing Plant or the STF Plant Could Adversely Affect the Business. This segment is largely dependent on the continued operation of its Oklahoma pork processing plant and the STF plant. The loss of or damage to either of these plants for any reason, including fire, tornado or earthquake, or the occurrence of adverse governmental action could adversely affect the business of this segment. Seaboard provides approximately one-third of STF\u2019s hogs for processing and also markets substantially all pork products produced. The closure, even temporarily, loss of, or damage to these plants for any reason, including pandemic, fire, tornado, earthquake, or the occurrence of adverse governmental action could adversely affect the business of this segment and have a material adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s liquidity and financial results.\n(5) This Segment is Subject to Complex Laws and Regulations That May Adversely Affect the Revenues, Costs, Manner or Feasibility of Doing Business. Federal, state and local laws, and domestic and international regulations governing worker health and safety, environmental protection, food safety and animal health and welfare significantly affect this segment\u2019s operations. Some requirements applicable to this segment may also be enforced by citizen groups. For example, operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, odors, the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. In another example, the State of California enacted Proposition 12, the Farm Animal Confinement Initiative (\u201cProposition 12\u201d), which will prohibit, after December 31, 2021, the sale within the State of California of uncooked pork produced from breeding sows or its offspring which have been confined in less than 24 square feet of usable floor space. The constitutionality of Proposition 12 is being challenged in two separate lawsuits pending in California. This segment is assessing Proposition 12 and the related costs of compliance, such as the additional capital expenditures that would be needed for construction of barns and pens provided for the requisite expanded animal spacing, in the event the constitutionality of Proposition 12 is upheld. If this segment is unable to comply with Proposition 12, Seaboard would not be able to sell uncooked pork products in California, which accounted for approximately 9% of its direct sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, in addition to indirect sales through further processor customers. If other pork processors similarly are unable to comply with Proposition 12 and cannot sell uncooked pork products in California, this could result in a significant oversupply of uncooked pork products being sold in locations other than California, which could result in a significant decline in the sales prices of such products. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and any future changes to them could result in significant consequences to Seaboard, including civil and criminal penalties, liability for damages, negative publicity and the inability to do business in certain locales.\n(6) Health Risk to Livestock Could Adversely Affect Production, the Supply of Raw Materials and the Business. Seaboard is subject to risks relating to its ability to maintain animal health and control diseases. The general health of the hogs and the reproductive performance of the sows could have an adverse impact on production and production costs, the supply of raw material to this segment\u2019s pork processing operations and consumer confidence. If this segment\u2019s hogs are affected by disease, Seaboard could be required to destroy infected livestock, which could adversely affect this segment\u2019s production or ability to sell or export its products. Moreover, the herd health of third-party suppliers could\nadversely affect the supply and cost of hogs available for purchase. Adverse publicity concerning any disease or health concern could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of this segment\u2019s food products.\n(7) This Segment is Subject to Disruption of Operations at Suppliers. Disruption of operations at suppliers, including co-packers, may impact this segment\u2019s product or raw material supply, which could have an adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s financial results. Additionally, actions taken to mitigate the impact of any potential disruption, including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption, may adversely affect Seaboard\u2019s financial results.\n(8) International Trade Barriers Could Adversely Affect This Segment\u2019s Operations. This segment realizes revenues from international markets, particularly Japan, Mexico and China. International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions, imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other restrictions, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws, and other economic and political uncertainties. These and other risks have resulted in, and in the future may result in, border closings or other international trade barriers that could have an adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s earnings.\n(9) The Operating Profit of the Biodiesel Production Facilities Could Be Adversely Impacted by Various Factors. The profitability of this segment\u2019s biodiesel plants could be adversely affected by various factors, including the market price of pork fat, other animal fats and vegetable oils, all of which are utilized to produce biodiesel, and the market price for biodiesel, which is influenced by world oil prices and U.S. government mandates and incentives to use biofuels. Unfavorable changes in these prices over extended periods of time or adverse changes in U.S. government mandates and incentives to use biofuels could adversely affect this segment\u2019s results of operations and could result in the potential impairment of the recorded value of the property, plant and equipment related to these facilities. Also, the federal blender\u2019s credits are not permanent and may not be renewed beyond 2022.\n(10) Difficulties Could Be Experienced in the Conversion of the New Renewable Diesel Production Facility. In February 2019, the Pork segment purchased an idle ethanol plant in Kansas. Projected costs to convert the existing plant\u2019s infrastructure to support the new renewable diesel production facility and the costs to construct the new portions of the renewable diesel plant are variable and could be higher than initially projected by the time the plant is operational. Also, significant construction delays could delay the expected timing of operations.\nSpecific Commodity Trading and Milling Segment Risks\n(1) This Segment Is Subject to Risks Associated with Foreign Operations. This segment principally operates in Africa, South America and the Caribbean and, in most cases, in what are generally regarded to be lesser-developed countries. Many of these foreign operations are subject to risks of doing business in lesser-developed countries, which are subject to potential civil unrest and government instability, increasing the exposure to potential expropriation, confiscation, war, insurrection, civil strife and revolution, corruption, currency inconvertibility and devaluation, and currency exchange controls. In addition, border restrictions and foreign government policies and regulations could restrict the purchase of various agricultural commodities and commodity products, reducing or limiting this segment\u2019s ability to access materials or ports, or to limit this segment\u2019s sales prices for products sold in local markets.\n(2) Fluctuations in Commodity Prices Could Adversely Affect the Business of This Segment. This segment\u2019s sales are significantly affected by fluctuating worldwide prices for various commodities, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal and, to a lesser degree, various other agricultural commodity products. These prices are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand, as well as other factors over which Seaboard has little or no control. European flour exports, donated food aid, flour dumping practices and worldwide and local crop production could contribute to these fluctuating market conditions and could have a significant impact on this segment\u2019s sales, value of commodities held in inventory and operating income.\n(3) This Segment Uses a Material Amount of Derivative Products to Manage Certain Market Risks. The commodity trading portion of this segment enters into various commodity derivative and foreign exchange derivative transactions to create what management believes is an economic hedge for commodity trades it executes or intends to execute with its customers. Failure to execute or improper execution of a derivative position, or a firmly committed sale or purchase contract, or a speculative transaction that closes without the desired result or exposure to counter party risk could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and liquidity.\n(4) This Segment Is Subject to Higher Than Normal Risks for Attracting and Retaining Key Personnel. In the commodity trading environment, loss of a key employee such as a commodity trader could have a negative impact resulting from the loss of revenues as personal customer relationships can be vital to obtaining and retaining business with various foreign customers. In the milling portion of this segment, employing and retaining qualified expatriate personnel are key elements to success given the difficult living conditions, the unique operating environments and the reliance on a relatively small number of executives to manage each individual location.\n(5) This Segment Faces Increasing Competition. This segment is experiencing increasing competition in certain foreign markets by well-capitalized originators, traders of commodities making sales directly to end-use customers and industrial-asset owners that compete in the same markets as this segment. If various competing raw-material originators refuse to sell commodities to Seaboard for sale in these foreign markets, it could be more challenging for this segment to purchase commodities for sale to its customers at competitive prices. Also, competition exists in the milling business with imported products or other local producers. This segment\u2019s sales volume and sale prices for commodities to customers, as well as results of operations, could be adversely impacted by such increased competition.\nSpecific Marine Segment Risks\n(1) The Demand for This Segment\u2019s Services Are Affected by International Trade and Fluctuating Freight Rates. This segment provides cargo shipping services in the U.S. and in many different countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America. In addition to the risks of overseas operations, fluctuations in economic conditions and unstable or hostile local political situations in the countries in which this segment operates could affect trade volumes and cargo freight rates, as well as adversely affect this segment\u2019s results of operations.\n(2) Chartered Ships Are Subject to Fluctuating Rates. Time-charter expenses are one of this segment\u2019s largest expenses. These costs can vary greatly due to a number of factors including the worldwide supply and demand for shipping. It is not possible to determine in advance whether a long-term charter contract will be favorable to this segment\u2019s business. Accordingly, entering into either long-term charter hire contracts during periods of decreasing charter hire costs or short-term charter hire contracts during periods of increasing charter hire costs could have an adverse effect on this segment\u2019s results of operations. In an effort to improve cargo services on higher frequency routes and use more capacity, this segment purchases space, also known as slots, on certain third-party operated vessels. It is expected that this segment will continue purchasing slots in the future, but these ship providers may not be reliable and cause shipment delays or other challenges.\n(3) Hurricanes May Disrupt Operations. This segment\u2019s port operations can be subject to disruption due to hurricanes, which could have an adverse effect on this segment\u2019s results of operations.\n(4) This Segment Is Subject to Complex Laws and Regulations That May Adversely Affect the Revenues, Costs, Manner or Feasibility of Doing Business. Regulations governing worker health and safety, environmental protection, port and terminal security, and the operation of vessels, including fuel regulations, significantly affect this segment\u2019s operations, including rate discussions and other related arrangements. Many aspects of the shipping industry, including rate agreements and vessel cost sharing agreements, are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission, the U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as well as regulation by private industry organizations. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes, while the failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions, the suspension or termination of Seaboard\u2019s operations or detention of its vessels. In addition, future changes in laws, regulations and standards, including allowed freight rate discussions and other related arrangements, may result in additional costs or a reduction in revenues.\nSpecific Sugar and Alcohol Segment Risks\n(1) The Success of This Segment Depends on the Condition of the Argentine Economy, Currency and Political Climate. This segment operates a sugar mill, alcohol production and power generation facility in Argentina. Fluctuations in economic conditions or changes in the Argentine political climate could have an impact on the costs of operations, the sales prices of products, export opportunities and the exchange rate of the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. In this regard, local sales prices for retail sugar and bioethanol are affected by government price controls and domestic prices for sugar are affected by import duties imposed by the Argentine government, impacting local volume sold, as well as imported and exported volumes to and from international markets. If import duties are changed, this could have a negative impact on the sales prices of this segment\u2019s products. In addition, the majority of this segment\u2019s sales are within Argentina, and any Argentine government attempts to control inflation through retail price controls on mass consumption products, including sugar, could adversely impact the local sales prices of this segment\u2019s products and the results of operations for this segment. In the second quarter of 2018, Argentina was determined to be a highly inflationary economy. A devaluation of the Argentine peso would have a negative impact on this segment\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\n(2) This Segment Is Subject to the Risks That Are Inherent in any Agricultural Business. Seaboard\u2019s results of operations for this segment may be adversely affected by numerous factors over which Seaboard has little or no control and that are inherent in any agricultural business, including reductions in the market prices for this segment\u2019s products, adverse weather and growing conditions, pest and disease problems, and new government regulations regarding agriculture and the marketing of agricultural products. Of these risks, weather particularly could adversely affect the amount and quality of the sugarcane produced by this segment and its competitors located in other regions of Argentina.\n(3) The Loss of This Segment\u2019s Sole Processing Facility Would Adversely Affect the Business. This segment is largely dependent on the continued operation of a single sugar mill. The loss of or damage to this mill for any reason, including fire, tornado or earthquake, or the occurrence of adverse governmental action or labor unrest resulting in labor strikes could adversely affect the business of this segment.\n(4) Labor Relations Challenges Could Adversely Affect Operations. This segment is dependent on unionized labor at its single sugar mill in Argentina. The political and economic environment in Argentina makes normal labor relations very challenging. Contributing to the situation are the historical policies of Argentina\u2019s government and the failure of the Argentine courts to enforce contractual obligations with unions and basic property rights. Interruptions in production as a result of labor unrest could adversely impact the quantity of sugarcane harvested and the amount of sugar, alcohol and power produced and could interfere with the distribution of products stored at the facility.\n(5) The Operating Profit of the Alcohol Production Facility Could Be Adversely Impacted by Government Regulations. The profitability of this segment\u2019s alcohol production facility could be adversely affected by Argentine government regulations regarding production quotas, fuel blends and sales prices in the bioethanol market. In addition, corn alcohol producers in Argentina have increased competition in the bioethanol market. Adverse changes in the Argentine government\u2019s regulations regarding bioethanol production quotas and fuel blends could adversely affect this segment\u2019s results of operations.\nSpecific Power Segment Risks\n(1) The Success of This Segment Depends on the Condition of the Dominican Republic Economy, Currency and Political Climate. Fluctuations in economic conditions or changes in the Dominican Republic political climate could have an impact on the costs of operations, the sales prices of products and the exchange rate of the Dominican peso to the U.S. dollar. In addition to significant currency fluctuations and the other risks of overseas operations, this segment could experience difficulty in obtaining timely collections of trade receivables from the government-owned distribution companies or other companies that must also collect from the government in order to make payments on their accounts. Currently, the Dominican Republic does not allow a free market to enable prices to rise with demand as the supply is restricted due to insufficient cash flow from electric distributors and the subsidy the government provides, which could limit this segment\u2019s profitability. As a result, the government has the ability to arbitrarily decide which power units will be able to operate, which can ultimately determine spot market prices for electricity generated and sold into the power grid and, therefore, could have adverse effects on results of operations.\n(2) Supply of Natural Gas Is Limited in the Dominican Republic. Supply of natural gas in the Dominican Republic is limited to one primary supplier. The current barge can run on other types of fuel, but the power barge under construction, will operate only on natural gas. Supply disruptions of natural gas could have a negative impact on this segment\u2019s operating income.\n(3) The Demand for This Segment\u2019s Services Are Affected by Competitors. This segment sells the power it generates primarily to government-owned distribution companies and the government has the ability to decide which power units will be able to operate. Typically, dispatch is done on the basis of a merit list with lower cost power plants dispatched before those with higher costs. More efficient power producer competitors, such as from renewable energy, including hydro, solar, and wind, or other nonrenewable energy sources like coal, are less costly to operate, and could cause the demand for this segment\u2019s energy to decline and the spot market rates to decline as well, which will adversely affect this segment\u2019s results of operations.\n(4) Difficulties Could Be Experienced in the Construction and Installation of the New Power Generating Barge. The new power generating barge is being constructed in Singapore. Installation and commissioning are anticipated to take several months, with commercial operations currently expected at the end of 2021. Significant construction delays or other difficulties encountered in the start-up of operations could have adverse effects on results of operations.\nSpecific Turkey Segment Risks\n(1) Fluctuations in Commodity Turkey Prices Could Adversely Affect the Results of Operations. Sales prices for turkey products are directly affected by both domestic and worldwide supply and demand for turkey products and other proteins, which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand as well as other factors over which Butterball has little or no control. Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball could be adversely affected by fluctuations in turkey commodity prices.\n(2) Increases in Costs of Butterball\u2019s Feed Components Could Adversely Affect Costs and Operating Margins. Feed costs are the most significant single component of the cost of raising turkeys and could be materially affected by commodity price fluctuations for corn, soybean meal and other commodity grain inputs. Butterball\u2019s results may be negatively affected by increased costs of the feed components. Butterball attempts to manage some of these risks through the use of commodity derivatives; however, this may also limit its ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations. Unless wholesale turkey prices correspondingly increase, increases in the prices of Butterball\u2019s feed components would adversely affect Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(3) Adverse Operating Results or Inability to Renew Financing Could Result in Need for Additional Investment. Butterball has third-party bank loan facilities, some of which are up for renewal in the next year, that are secured by substantially all of the assets of Butterball. Adverse operating results could cause Butterball to default on such loan facilities or cause lenders to not renew existing financing, which could result in a significant adverse impact on Butterball\u2019s financial position or result in Seaboard needing to increase its investment or provide financing to Butterball.\n(4) Decreased Perception of Value in the Butterball Brand and Changes in Consumer Preferences Could Adversely Affect Sales Quantity and Price of Butterball Products. Butterball is a premium brand name, built on a long history of offering a quality product that has been differentiated in the market. The value of the Butterball brand allows for sales of a higher unit price than other turkey products. In order to maintain this advantage, Butterball must continue to support the brand with successful marketing efforts and develop new products. Consumer product preferences continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer lifestyles; digital shopping patterns; and competitive product and pricing pressures. If Butterball\u2019s products fail to meet consumer preferences, or Butterball fails to introduce new products or product extensions on a timely basis, the brand value could diminish significantly. In addition, negative news reports for any reason related to Butterball or the turkey/poultry industry could negatively impact this brand perception, Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(5) The Loss of Butterball\u2019s Primary Further Processing Facility Could Adversely Affect Butterball\u2019s Business. Although Butterball has four processing plants and two further processing plants, Butterball is disproportionately dependent on the continued operation of the processing plant in Mt. Olive, North Carolina, that handles a significant volume of the production of further processed turkey products. The closure, even temporarily, loss of or damage to this plant for any reason, including pandemic, fire, hurricane, tornado, or the occurrence of an adverse governmental action could adversely affect the results of operations and financial position for Butterball and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(6) Health Risk to Poultry Could Adversely Affect Production, the Supply of Raw Materials and Butterball\u2019s Business.
