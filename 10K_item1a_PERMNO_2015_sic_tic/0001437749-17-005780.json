{"cik": "855683", "company": "MILESTONE SCIENTIFIC INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following factors may affect the growth and profitability of Milestone Scientific and should be considered by any prospective purchaser or current holder of our securities:\nMilestone Scientific does not have a consistent history of profitable operations. Continuing losses could exhaust capital resources and force Milestone Scientific to discontinue operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, revenues were approximately $10.5 million and $9.4 million, respectively. Milestone Scientific has a net loss of approximately $5.9 million for year ended December 31, 2016 and a net loss of approximately $5.4 million for year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, Milestone Scientific has had losses for each year since the commencement of operations with the exception of 2013. Milestone Scientific had an accumulated deficit of approximately $73 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, Milestone Scientific had cash and cash equivalents approximately $3.6 million, and working capital of approximately $7.7 million. Dental revenues are projected to improve in the upcoming 12 months due to the new exclusive distribution arrangement for its dental products for the United States and Canada with Henry Schein and increase dental revenues from out China business sector. To further reduce our expenditures, Milestone Medical expenses related to FDA clearance for the epidural and intra-articular instruments can be controlled as required to meet our budget. By limiting the FDA related expenses and increasing the dental instrument and handpieces revenue through the new distribution agreement, management believes that Milestone Scientific will have sufficient cash to meet all of its anticipated obligations over the next twelve months from the filing date of this Form 10-K.\nMilestone Scientific management continues to examine all areas of the business to manage our cash flow. Milestone Scientific is actively pursuing the generation of positive cash flows from operating activities through an increase in revenue based upon management\u2019s assessment of present contracts and reductions in operating expenses.\nWe cannot become successful unless we gain greater market acceptance for our products and technology.\nAs with any new technology, there is substantial risk that the marketplace will not accept the potential benefits of this technology or be unwilling to pay for any cost differential with the existing technologies. Market acceptance of CompuDent\u00ae, STA Instrument, The Safety Wand\u00ae, CompuMed\u00ae and CompuFlo\u00ae depends, in large part, upon the ability to educate potential customers of the product\u2019s distinctive characteristics and benefits and will require substantial marketing efforts and expense. More than 47,000 of the STA Instrument and its predecessors have been sold worldwide since 1998. Since being introduced to market in February 2007, more than 20,000 of the STA Instrument have been sold. Milestone Scientific cannot assure that its current or proposed products will obtain enough of a broad based acceptance practitioners or that any of the current or proposed products will be able to compete effectively against current and alternative products.\nOur limited distribution channels must be expanded in order to become successful.\nFuture revenues depend on Milestone Scientific's ability to market and distribute its computer-controlled injection products successfully. Beginning January 1, 2016, Milestone Scientific entered into a non-exclusive distribution agreement with Henry Schein. In June 2016, we established new exclusive distribution arrangements for our dental products for the United States and Canada with Henry Schein. Under these arrangements we will, for the first time, have a semi-dedicated independent sales force visiting dentists. We believe that these arrangements will be more effective than previous arrangements which primarily relied on appearances at dental shows and catalog sales. To be successful, Milestone Scientific will need to engage additional distributors, on a worldwide bases provide for their proper training and ensure adequate customer support. Milestone Scientific cannot assure that it will be able to hire and retain an adequate sales force and modify management or engage suitable distributors, or that the sales efforts or distributors will be able to successfully market and sell the products.\nExcessive returns under the June 2016 Exclusive Distribution and Supply Agreement with Henry Schein, Inc. could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn June 2016, we entered into a new exclusive distribution and supply agreement with Henry Schein pursuant to which they were appointed as the exclusive distributor for our dental products in the United States and Canada. Under that agreement, Henry Schein has a right to return our products for full credit against the purchase price paid by them under limited circumstances in accordance with such agreement, including but not limited to, returns due to shipment error by us or factory defect. Excessive returns during any calendar year could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur near-term prospects are dependent on the marketing success of our epidural anesthetic injections and intra-articular injection instruments in the EU community. If we fail to successfully commercialize these instruments in the EU, our business and prospects would be harmed significantly.\nOur near-term prospects are dependent upon our success in marketing our epidural anesthetic injections and intra-articular injection instruments in the EU community where we have previously received CE approval. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize these products in the EU. If we fail to successfully commercialize these products in the EU, our business and prospects would be harmed significantly.\nOur prospects are dependent on FDA approval of our epidural anesthetic injections instrument to permit marketing in the United States If we fail to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to sell this instrument in the United States, or upon approval, fail to successfully commercialize this instrument in the United States, our business and prospects would be harmed significantly.\nOur prospects are dependent upon our receipt of FDA approval of our epidural anesthetic injections instrument. We have filed a 510(k) application with respect to this instrument with the FDA and approval, which will permit us to commence marketing of the instruments in the United States, is pending. There can be no assurance that we will obtain the FDA approvals necessary to sell our epidural anesthetic injections instrument in the United States. In addition, even if we obtain such regulatory approvals, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize this product in the United States. If we fail to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to sell this instrument or fail to successfully commercialize this product in the United States, our business and prospects would be harmed significantly.\nChanges in laws and regulations over which we have no control can significantly affect our business and results of operations.\nAny governmental entity that regulates our operations in the country in which they are located may enact new legislation or adopt new laws and regulations or policies at any time, and new judicial decisions may change the interpretation of existing legislation or regulations at any time in any of the countries in which our operations or projects are located. We have no control over any such changes. Any new laws or regulations governing our operations could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and prospects.\nOur planned operations in the developing world could cause us to incur additional costs and risks associated with doing business in developing markets.\nWe are seeking to operate in the developing world (e.g., China), which would make us vulnerable to political, economic and social instability in such areas. Many areas of the developing world have experienced political, economic and social uncertainty in recent years, including an economic crisis characterized in some cases by increased inflation, high domestic interest rates, negative economic growth, reduced consumer purchasing power and high unemployment. Political, economic and social instability in these countries may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe participate in a highly competitive environment.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions. Our products may be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations. We face intense competition from other manufacturers. Some of our competitors may be larger than we are and may have greater financial, technical, research, marketing, sales, distribution and other resources than we do. We believe that price competition will continue among products developed in our markets. Our competitors may develop or market technologies and products that are more effective or commercially attractive than any we are developing or marketing. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and introducing or commercializing products before we do. Such developments could have a significant negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to compete successfully, we may not be able to do so in a profitable manner.\nOur success depends upon the development of new products and product enhancements, which entails considerable time and expense.\nWe place a high priority on the development of new products to add to our product portfolio, as well as on the development of enhancements to our existing products. Product development involves substantial expense and we cannot be certain that a completed product will generate sufficient revenue for our business to justify the resources that we devote to research and development related to such product. The time and expense required to develop new products and product enhancements is difficult to predict and we cannot guarantee that we will succeed in developing, introducing and marketing new products and product enhancements. Our inability to successfully develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis or at all, or to achieve market acceptance of such products, could materially impair our business.\nWe are dependent on adequate protection of our patent and proprietary rights.\nWe rely on patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. However, these legal means afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or remedies to gain or keep any advantages we may have over our competitors. We cannot guarantee that others may not independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our technology and trade secrets. Our competitors, many of which have substantial resources and may make substantial investments in competing technologies, may apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to manufacture or market our products. Further, while we do not believe that any of our products or processes interfere with the rights of others, third parties may nonetheless assert patent infringement claims against us in the future.\nCostly litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how we own, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope, or validity of our proprietary rights and the rights of others. Any claims of infringement against us may involve significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent or delay us from manufacturing, selling or using our products. The occurrence of such litigation or the effect of an adverse determination in any of this type of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to substantial domestic and international government regulation, including regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes. Failure by us to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe FDA regulates the approval, manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the United States. Significant government regulation also exists in other countries in which we conduct business. As a device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European community, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product recalls or related field actions, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing. Efficacy or safety concerns, an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace, and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions, withdrawals, and/or declining sales.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal and state health care fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and we may become subject to such litigation. If we are unable to comply or have not fully complied with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur operations are and will continue to be directly, or indirectly through our customers and health care professionals, subject to various U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, federal False Claims Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d). These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, and marketing and education programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and, despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil and administrative sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. An alleged violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be used as a predicate offense to establish liability pursuant to other federal laws and regulations such as the federal False Claims Act. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for health care items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201crelators\u201d or \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of medical device, pharmaceutical and health care companies to have to defend False Claim Act actions. The Affordable Care Act includes provisions expanding the ability of certain relators to bring actions that would have been previously dismissed under prior law. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 encouraged states to enact or modify their state false claims act to be at least as effective as the federal False Claims Act by granting states a portion of any federal Medicaid funds recovered through Medicaid-related actions. Most states have enacted state false claims laws, and many of those states included laws with qui tam provisions. States had until March 31, 2013 to enact or amend their false claims laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act for review and approval to receive a greater portion of any recovery.\nThe Affordable Care Act includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid starting in 2012 to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals beginning in August 2013 and to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services starting in 2014 for subsequent public disclosure. Manufacturers must also disclose investment interests held by physicians and their family members. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to $1 million per year for knowing violations and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. In addition, some states, such as Massachusetts and Vermont, impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians. If we receive FDA clearance to market our epidural anesthetic injections and/or our intra-articular injection instruments in the United States, these laws could affect our promotional activities by limiting the kinds of interactions we could have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of our system. Both the disclosure laws and gift bans will impose administrative, cost and compliance burdens on us.\nWe are unable to predict whether we could be subject to actions under any of these laws, or the impact of such actions. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, or an administrative action of suspension or exclusion from government health care reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the FCPA and other countries\u2019 anti-corruption/anti-bribery regimes, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. The FCPA prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.\nSafeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on two principal manufacturers. If Milestone Scientific cannot maintain its existing relationships or develop new ones, it may have to cease operations.\nMilestone Scientific and its subsidiary has informal arrangements with the manufacturer of the STA Instrument, CompuDent\u00ae and CompuMed\u00ae and with one of the principal manufacturers of the handpieces, for those items, respectively. Pursuant to the informal arrangements, they manufacture these instruments and handpieces under specific purchase orders without minimum purchase commitment. Milestone Scientific has a manufacturing agreement with one of the principal manufacturers, which is a related party, of its handpieces pursuant to which they manufacture products under specific purchase orders but without minimum purchase commitments. Milestone Scientific has been supplied by the manufacturer of the STA Instrument, CompuDent\u00ae and CompuMed\u00ae epidural and intra-articular instruments since the commencement of production in 1998, the manufacturer of its handpieces since 2003. However, termination of the manufacturing relationship with any of these manufacturers could significantly and adversely affect the ability to produce and sell the products. Though other alternate sources of supply for handpieces exist, Milestone Scientific would need to recover its existing tools or have new tools produced to establish relationships with new suppliers. Establishing new manufacturing relationships could involve significant expense and delay. Any curtailment or interruptions of the supply, whether or not as a result or termination of the relationship, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims that are not fully covered by insurance and that could put Milestone Scientific under financial strain.\nMilestone Scientific could be subject to claims for personal injury from the alleged malfunction or misuse of the dental and medical products. While Milestone Scientific carries liability insurance that is believed to be adequate, Milestone Scientific cannot assure that the insurance coverage will be sufficient to pay such claims should they be successful. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMilestone Scientific relies on the continuing services of its Chief Executive Officer and Director of Clinical Affairs.\nMilestone Scientific depends on the personal efforts and abilities of its Chief Executive Officer and Director of Clinical Affairs. Milestone Scientific maintains a key man life insurance policy in the amount of $1,000,000 on the life of its Chief Executive Officer. However, the loss of his services or the services of its Director of Clinical Affairs, on whom Milestone Scientific maintains no insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on the business.\nThe market price of Milestone Scientific\u2019s common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of various factors, some of which are beyond Milestone Scientific\u2019s control.\nMilestone Scientific\u2019s stock price has been extremely volatile, fluctuating during the last two years between $4.00 and $1.27. The market price of common stock could continue to fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, some of which may be beyond Milestone Scientific\u2019s control.\nMilestone Scientific is controlled by a limited number of stockholders.\nMilestone Scientific\u2019s principal stockholders, Leonard Osser, Gian Domenico Trombetta, K. Tucker Andersen, and Robert Gintel beneficially own approximately 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, they have the ability to exercise substantial control over Milestone Scientific\u2019s affairs and corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including electing directors, selling all or substantially all of the assets, merging with another entity or amending its certificate of incorporation. This de facto control could delay, deter or prevent a change in control and could adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for Milestone Scientific\u2019s securities.\nFuture sales or the potential for sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock could cause the trading price of common stock to decline and could impair Milestone Scientific\u2019s ability to raise capital through subsequent equity offerings.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public markets, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of the stock to decline and could materially impair its ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. At December 31, 2016, Milestone Scientific had outstanding options to purchase 1,736,994 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $0.75 to $3.89 per share with a weighted average exercise price of $1.85. Holders of these options are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of the common stock and are likely to exercise their securities at a time when Milestone Scientific would be able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms. Thus, the terms upon which Milestone Scientific will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected, since the holders of outstanding options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when Milestone Scientific would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable than the exercise terms provided by such outstanding securities. The market price of the common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of various factors, many of which are beyond Milestone Scientific\u2019s control.\nAdherence to Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be so costly that compliance could have an adverse effect on Milestone Scientific.\nThe management of Milestone Scientific has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Milestone Scientific complied with Sarbanes-Oxley requirements to include in the annual report a management report on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. In 2005, Milestone Scientific hired an outside consultant to assist with the development and implementation of the necessary internal controls and reporting procedures. In 2016 and 2015, Milestone Scientific utilized the outside consultant on a quarterly basis to review compliance with the internal controls over financial reporting. This expense amounted to approximately $20,000 and $14,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively and the cost is expected to continue in 2017.", "PERMNO": 82621, "SIC": 3843, "TIC": "MLSS"}
