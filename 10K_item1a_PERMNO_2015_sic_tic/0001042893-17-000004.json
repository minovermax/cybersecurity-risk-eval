{"cik": "1042893", "company": "DRIL-QUIP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn this Item 1A., the terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cDril-Quip\u201d used herein refer to Dril-Quip, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated or as the context so requires.\nA material or extended decline in expenditures by the oil and gas industry could significantly reduce our revenue and income.\nOur business depends upon the condition of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on exploration, drilling and production operations. The level of capital expenditures is generally dependent on the prevailing view of future oil and gas prices, which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas, including:\n\u2022\nworldwide economic activity;\n\u2022\nthe level of exploration and production activity;\n\u2022\ninterest rates and the cost of capital;\n\u2022\nenvironmental regulation;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and foreign policies regarding exploration and development of oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability and/or desire of OPEC and other major producers to set and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations regarding future oil and gas exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring and producing oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe cost of developing alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\nthe availability, expiration date and price of onshore and offshore leases;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in onshore and offshore areas;\n\u2022\nthe success of drilling for oil and gas in unconventional resource plays such as shale formations;\n\u2022\nalternative opportunities to invest in onshore exploration and production opportunities;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances; and\n\u2022\nweather conditions.\nOil and gas prices and the level of drilling and production activity have been characterized by significant volatility in recent years. Worldwide military, political and economic events have contributed to crude oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future.\nWe expect continued volatility in both crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as in the level of drilling and production related activities. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and gas may cancel or curtail programs, seek to renegotiate contract terms, including the price of our products and services, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons. These risks are greater during periods of low or declining commodity prices. Continued significant or prolonged declines in hydrocarbon prices have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to satisfy technical requirements, testing requirements or other specifications under contracts and contract tenders.\nOur products are used primarily in deepwater, harsh environment and severe service applications. Our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services, which may also include extensive testing requirements. We anticipate that such testing requirements will become more common in our contracts. In addition, recent scrutiny of the drilling industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications. We cannot assure you that our products will be able to satisfy the specifications or that we will be able to perform the full-scale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts, or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations. If our products are unable to satisfy such requirements, or we are unable to perform any\nrequired full-scale testing, our customers may cancel their contracts and/or seek new suppliers, and our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on technology provided by third parties and our business may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to renew our licensing arrangements with them.\nWe have existing contracts and may enter into new contracts with customers that require us to use technology or to purchase components from third parties, including some of our competitors. In the ordinary course of our business, we have entered into licensing agreements with some of these third parties for the use of such technology, including a license from a competitor of a technology important to our subsea wellheads. We may not be able to renew our existing licenses or to purchase these components on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to use a technology or purchase a component, we may not be able to meet existing contractual commitments without increased costs or modifications or at all. In addition, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology or component or to redesign our products, either of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully compete with other manufacturers of drilling and production equipment.\nSeveral of our primary competitors are diversified multinational companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than ours and which have been engaged in the manufacturing business for a much longer time than us. If these competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to developing and marketing competitive products and services, we may not be able to compete effectively. Similarly, consolidation among our competitors could enhance their product and service offerings and financial resources, further intensifying competition.\nThe loss of a significant customer could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur principal customers are major integrated oil and gas companies, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies throughout the world. Drilling contractors and engineering and construction companies also represent a portion of our customer base. In 2016, our top 15 customers represented approximately 75% of total revenues, and Chevron and its affiliated companies accounted for approximately 16% of total revenues. In 2015 and 2014, our top 15 customers represented approximately 61% of total revenues, and Chevron and its affiliated companies accounted for approximately 12% and 10% of total revenues, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in 2016, 2015 or 2014. While we are not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, the loss of one or more of our significant customers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur customers\u2019 industries are undergoing continuing consolidation that may impact our results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry is rapidly consolidating and, as a result, some of our largest customers have consolidated and are using their size and purchasing power to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions. This consolidation may result in reduced capital spending by some of our customers or the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers, which may lead to decreased demand for our products and services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our level of sales to a customer that has consolidated or replace that revenue with increased business activity with other customers. As a result, the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We are unable to predict what effect consolidations in the industry may have on price, capital spending by our customers, our selling strategies, our competitive position, our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with our customers.\nIncreases in the cost of raw materials and energy used in our manufacturing processes could negatively impact our profitability.\nAny increases in commodity prices for items such as nickel, molybdenum and heavy metal scrap that are used to make the steel alloys required for our products would result in an increase in our raw material costs. Similarly, any increase in energy costs would increase our product costs. If we are not successful in raising our prices on products to compensate for any increased raw material or energy costs, our margins will be negatively impacted.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner.\nOur manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials from third parties. The ability of these third parties to deliver raw materials may be affected by events beyond our control. Any interruption in the supply of raw\nmaterials needed to manufacture our products could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation with our customers.\nConditions in the global financial system may have impacts on our business and financial position that we currently cannot predict.\nUncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact the ability of our customers to finance purchases of our products and services and could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders included in our backlog or adversely affect the collectability of our receivables. If the availability of credit to our customers is reduced, they may reduce their drilling and production expenditures, thereby decreasing demand for our products and services, which could have a negative impact on our financial position. Additionally, unsettled conditions could have an impact on our suppliers, causing them to be unable to meet their obligations to us. Although we do not currently anticipate a need to access the credit markets in the short term, a prolonged constriction on future lending by banks or investors could result in higher interest rates on future debt obligations or could restrict our ability to obtain sufficient financing to meet our long-term operational and capital needs.\nWe are exposed to the credit risks of our customers, and a general increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by customers could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. Certain of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. In an economic downturn, commodity prices typically decline, and the credit markets and availability of credit can be expected to be constrained. Additionally, certain of our customers\u2019 equity values could decline. The combination of lower cash flow due to commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of available debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our customers\u2019 liquidity and ability to pay or otherwise perform on their obligations to us. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. Any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could adversely affect our liquidity.\nOur backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future revenues and earnings.\nThe revenues projected in our backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. All of the projects currently included in our backlog are subject to change and/or termination at the option of the customer. In the case of a change or termination, the customer is generally required to pay us for work performed and other costs necessarily incurred as a result of the change or termination.\nWe can give no assurance that our backlog will remain at current levels. Sales of our products are affected by prices for oil and natural gas, which have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. Contracts denominated in foreign currency are also affected by changes in exchange rates, which may have a negative impact on our backlog. When drilling and production levels are depressed, a customer may no longer need the equipment or services currently under contract or may be able to obtain comparable equipment or services at lower prices. As a result, customers may exercise their termination rights or attempt to renegotiate contract terms. Continued declines in oil and natural gas prices could also reduce new customer orders, possibly causing a decline in our future backlog. If we experience significant project terminations, suspensions or scope adjustments to contracts reflected in our backlog, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nOur international operations expose us to instability and changes in economic and political conditions and other risks inherent to international business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nWe have substantial international operations, with approximately 66% of our revenues from foreign sales in 2016 compared to 63% in both 2015 and 2014. We operate our business and market our products and services in many of the significant oil and gas producing areas in the world and are, therefore, subject to the risks customarily attendant to international operations and investments in foreign countries. Risks associated with our international operations include:\n\u2022\nvolatility in general economic, social and political conditions;\n\u2022\nterrorist threats or acts, war and civil disturbances;\n\u2022\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets;\n\u2022\nrenegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;\n\u2022\nforeign taxation, including changes in laws or differing interpretations of existing laws;\n\u2022\nassaults on property or personnel;\n\u2022\nrestrictive action by local governments;\n\u2022\nforeign and domestic monetary policies;\n\u2022\nlimitations on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ntravel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats; and\n\u2022\nchanges in currency exchange rates.\nAny of these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to manufacture products abroad or the demand for our products and services in some locations. To date, we have not experienced any significant problems in foreign countries arising from local government actions or political instability, but there is no assurance that such problems will not arise in the future. Interruption of our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our overall operations.\nOur international operations expose us to compliance risks.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis exposes us and our subsidiaries to risks inherent in complying with the laws and regulations of a number of different nations, including various anti-bribery laws. We do business and have operations in a number of developing countries that have relatively underdeveloped legal and regulatory systems compared to more developed countries. Several of these countries are generally perceived as presenting a higher than normal risk of corruption, or as having a culture in which requests for improper payments are not discouraged. Maintaining and administering an effective anti-bribery compliance program under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act of 2010 and similar statutes of other nations in these environments presents greater challenges than is the case in more developed countries.\nIn addition, our import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. The laws and regulations concerning import and export activity, recordkeeping and reporting, import and export control and economic sanctions are complex and subject to frequent change.\nThe precautions we take to prevent and detect misconduct, fraud or non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations may not be able to prevent such occurrences, and we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines, penalties or other sanctions, including debarment from government contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and there are inherent uncertainties in the final determination of our tax liabilities.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. Accordingly, our effective income tax rate and other tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, disagreements with taxing authorities with respect to the interpretation of tax laws and regulations and changes in tax laws. In particular, foreign income tax returns of foreign subsidiaries and related entities are routinely examined by foreign tax authorities, and these tax examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, interest or penalties. Refer to \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d regarding tax assessments in Brazil. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to discretion. If our assessments are incorrect, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMoreover, the United States Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and other government agencies in the other jurisdictions where we and our subsidiaries do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of \"base erosion and profit shifting,\" where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the United States and other countries in which we and our subsidiaries do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and such changes could adversely affect us.\nOur excess cash is invested in various financial instruments which may subject us to potential losses.\nWe invest excess cash in various financial instruments including interest bearing accounts, money market mutual funds and funds which invest in U.S. Treasury obligations and repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury obligations. However, changes in the financial markets, including interest rates, as well as the performance of the issuers, can affect the market value of our short-term investments.\nWe may suffer losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations and limitations on the ability to repatriate income or capital to the United States.\nWe conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the U. S. dollar, and our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot assure you that we will be able to protect the Company against such fluctuations in the future. Historically, we have not conducted business in countries that limit repatriation of earnings. However, as we expand our international operations, we may begin operating in countries that have such limitations. Further, we cannot assure you that the countries in which we currently operate will not adopt policies limiting repatriation of earnings in the future.\nOur foreign subsidiaries also hold significant amounts of cash that may be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes of the applicable foreign country if we dividend that cash to us, as we are located in the United States.\nOur business involves numerous operating hazards that may not be covered by insurance. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur products are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion and production applications that can cause personal injury, product liability and environmental claims. In addition, certain areas where our products are used, including in and near the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, are close to high population areas and subject to hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis. A catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and/or services are used may expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, product liability, environmental damage or commercial claims. Our general liability insurance program includes an aggregate coverage limit of $200 million for claims with respect to property damage, injury or death and pollution. However, our insurance policies may not cover fines, penalties or costs and expenses related to government-mandated cleanup of pollution. In addition, our insurance does not provide coverage for all liabilities, and we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe attempt to further limit our liability through contractual indemnification provisions with our customers. We generally seek to enter into contracts for the provision of our products and services that provide for (1) the responsibility of each party to the contract for personal injuries to, or the death of, its employees and damages to its property, (2) cross-indemnification with other contractors providing products and/or services to the other party to the contract with respect to personal injury, death and property damage and (3) the operator being responsible for claims brought by third parties for personal injury, death, property loss or damage relating to pollution or other well control events. We may not be able to successfully obtain favorable contractual provisions, and a failure to do so may increase our risks and costs, which could materially impact our results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that any party that is contractually obligated to indemnify us will be financially able to do so.\nWe may lose money on fixed-price contracts.\nA portion of our business consists of the designing, manufacturing and selling of our equipment for major projects pursuant to competitive bids, and is performed on a fixed-price basis. Under these contracts, we are typically responsible for all cost overruns, other than the amount of any cost overruns resulting from requested changes in order specifications. Our actual costs and any gross profit realized on these fixed-price contracts may vary from the estimated amounts on which these contracts were originally based. This may occur for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nerrors in estimates or bidding;\n\u2022\nchanges in availability and cost of labor and materials;\n\u2022\nvariations in productivity from our original estimates; and\n\u2022\nmaterial changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThese variations and the risks inherent in our projects may result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, variations from estimated contract performance could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we do not develop new products and secure and retain patents related to our products.\nTechnology is an important component of our business and growth strategy, and our success as a company depends to a significant extent on the development and implementation of new product designs and improvements. Whether we can continue to develop systems and services and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements and, if so, at prices acceptable to our customers will be significant factors in determining our ability to compete in the industry in which we operate. Many of our competitors are large multinational companies that may have significantly greater financial resources than we have, and they may be able to devote greater resources to research and development of new systems, services and technologies than we are able to do.\nOur ability to compete effectively will also depend on our ability to continue to obtain patents on our proprietary technology and products. Although we do not consider any single patent to be material to our business as a whole, the inability to protect our future innovations through patents could have a material adverse effect.\nWe may be required to recognize a charge against current earnings because of percentage-of-completion accounting.\nRevenues and profits on long-term project contracts are recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis. We calculate the percent complete and apply the percentage to determine revenues earned and the appropriate portion of total estimated costs. Accordingly, purchase order price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as the work progresses, and adjustments proportionate to the percentage complete are reflected in the period when such estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits, we would have to recognize a charge against current earnings, which could be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment.\nLoss of our key management or other personnel could adversely impact our business.\nWe depend on the services of Blake DeBerry, President and Chief Executive Officer, and James Gariepy, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Together, Mr. DeBerry and Mr. Gariepy have over 40 years with the Company and approximately 70 years of relevant industry experience. The loss of either of these officers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn addition, competition for skilled machinists, fabricators and technical personnel among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is intense, and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research activities successfully and develop and produce marketable products and services. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increase in the wage rates paid by us or both. If either of these events were to occur, in the near-term, the profits realized by us from work in progress would be reduced and, in the long-term, our production capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nAcquisitions, dispositions and investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate purchases and sales of assets, businesses or other investments. These transactions may not result in the anticipated realization of savings, creation of efficiencies, offering of new products or services, generation of cash or income or reduction of risk. In addition, acquisitions may be financed by borrowings, requiring us to incur debt, or by the issuance of our common stock. These transactions involve numerous risks, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022\nany acquisition would be successfully integrated into our operations and internal controls;\n\u2022\nthe due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition would uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure;\n\u2022\nthe use of cash for acquisitions would not adversely affect our cash available for capital expenditures and other uses;\n\u2022\nany disposition, investment, acquisition or integration would not divert management resources from the operation of our business; or\n\u2022\nany disposition, investment, acquisition or integration would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur operations and our customers\u2019 operations are subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.\nOur business and our customers\u2019 businesses may be significantly affected by:\n\u2022\nfederal, state, local and foreign laws and other regulations relating to the oilfield operations, worker safety and the protection of the environment;\n\u2022\nchanges in these laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nlevels of enforcement of these laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\ninterpretation of existing laws and regulations.\nIn addition, we depend on the demand for our products and services from the oil and gas industry. This demand is affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry in general, including those specifically directed to offshore operations. For example, the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for economic or other policy reasons could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products. We cannot determine the extent to which our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations and enforcement thereof.\nVarious new regulations intended to improve particularly offshore safety systems and environmental protection have been issued since 2010 that have increased the complexity of the drilling permit process and may limit the opportunity for some operators to continue deepwater drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial operations. Third-party challenges to industry operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may also serve to further delay or restrict activities. If the new regulations, policies, operating procedures and possibility of increased legal liability are viewed by our current or future customers as a significant impairment to expected profitability on projects, they could discontinue or curtail their operations, thereby adversely affecting our financial operations by decreasing demand for our products.\nBecause of our foreign operations and sales, we are also subject to changes in foreign laws and regulations that may encourage or require hiring of local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. If we fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur businesses and our customers\u2019 businesses are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are also subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment. These environmental laws and regulations affect the products and services we design, market and sell, as well as the facilities where we manufacture our products. For example, our operations are subject to numerous and complex laws and regulations that, among other things, may regulate the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes; require acquisition of environmental permits related to our operations; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various materials that can be released into the environment; limit or prohibit operation activities in certain ecologically sensitive and other protected areas; regulate specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; require compliance with operational and equipment standards; impose testing, reporting and record-keeping requirements; and require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations. We are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with such environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. In addition, environmental laws and regulations could limit our customers\u2019 exploration and production activities. These laws and regulations change frequently, which makes it impossible for us to predict their cost or impact on our future operations. For example, legislation to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases has been introduced, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the annual United Nations Climate Change Conferences, including the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP 21) in November 2015, which\nresulted in the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, signed by the U.S. on April 22, 2016, requires countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, every five years. Also, the EPA has undertaken efforts to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions and their effects. Following a finding by the EPA that certain greenhouse gases represent a danger to human health, the EPA has expanded its regulations relating to those emissions and has adopted rules imposing permitting and reporting obligations. The results of the permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of these greenhouse gases by the EPA. Subsequent to the Paris Agreement, there has been no significant legislative progress in cap and trade proposals or greenhouse gas emission reductions. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the hydrocarbons that our customers produce. Consequently, such legislation or regulatory programs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. It is too early to determine whether, or in what form, further regulatory action regarding greenhouse gas emissions will be adopted or what specific impact a new regulatory action might have on us or our customers. Generally, the anticipated regulatory actions do not appear to affect us in any material respect that is different, or to any materially greater or lesser extent, than other companies that are our competitors. However, our business and prospects could be adversely affected to the extent laws are enacted or modified or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts our customers\u2019 exploration and production activities or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to us or our customers.\nEnvironmental laws may provide for \u201cstrict liability\u201d for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety, rendering a party liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws and regulations provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. In addition, we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. These laws and regulations also may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at the time such acts were performed. Any of these laws and regulations could result in claims, fines or expenditures that could be material to results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a failure or breach of our information technology systems.\nOur business operations depend on our information technology (IT) systems. Despite our security and back-up measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to computer viruses, natural disasters and other disruptions or failures. The failure of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous adverse consequences, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and those of our customers, inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, increased overhead costs, loss of intellectual property and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to prevent or respond to damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock and the price at which we may sell common stock in the future are subject to large fluctuations in response to any of the following:\n\u2022\nlimited trading volume in our common stock;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022\ngeneral financial market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe prices of natural gas and oil;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nour liquidity;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise additional funds;\n\u2022\nour involvement in litigation; and\n\u2022\nother events.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the near future.\nWe have not paid any dividends in the past and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our Board of Directors review this policy on a regular basis in light of our earnings, financial position and market opportunities. We currently intend to retain any earnings for the future operation and development of our business as well as potential stock repurchases or acquisition opportunities.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nThe existence of some provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult, including:\n\u2022\nprovisions relating to the classification, nomination and removal of our directors;\n\u2022\nprovisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovisions requiring the approval of the holders of at least 80% of our voting stock for a broad range of business combination transactions with related persons; and\n\u2022\nthe authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.\nOur stockholder rights plan could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, our company or a large block of our common stock. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.", "PERMNO": 85424, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "DRQ"}
