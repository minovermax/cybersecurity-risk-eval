RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our capital stock involves a number of risks. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all of the risks, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. The realization of events pertaining to any of these risks could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as the market value of our capital stock. Additional risks not presently known to the Company, or currently deemed immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe operate in a heavily regulated environment.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OFR. Banking regulations govern the activities in which we may engage and are primarily intended to protect depositors and the banking system as a whole, not the interests of shareholders. These regulations impact our lending and investment practices, capital structure and dividend policy, among other things. The financial services industry is subject to frequent legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes, including sweeping changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act, the full-impact of which cannot be predicted. Changes to such regulations may have a materially adverse effect on our operations by subjecting the Company to additional compliance costs, restrictions on our operations, and other enforcement actions in the event of noncompliance.\nWe are also required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and NASDAQ. In particular, we are required to include management reports on internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The SEC also has proposed a number of new rules or regulations requiring additional disclosure, including compensation rules under the Dodd-Frank Act. We expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. Any failure to track and comply with the various rules may have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the value of our securities.\nRecent legislation, regulatory initiatives and government actions in response to market and economic conditions may significantly affect our business, capital requirements, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act restructured the regulation of depository institutions and the financial services industry. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created largely to administer and enforce consumer and fair lending laws, a function that has historically been performed by the depository institution regulators. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business and operations will not be fully known until all regulations implementing the Act are written and adopted. The Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased compliance costs resulting from possible changes to future consumer and fair lending regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the limits on federal deposit insurance to $250 thousand.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved the final rules to implement the Basel III capital guidelines creating changes to the regulatory capital framework including, but not limited to, revised definitions of \u201ccapital\u201d for regulatory purposes, the types and minimum levels of capital required under the prompt corrective action rules and for other regulatory purposes, and the risk-weighting of various assets. Various provisions have been included in the final rules to provide relief to banking organizations under $50.0 billion in assets, such as community banks like ours. Compliance with the final Basel III rules was mandatory as of January 1, 2015 for banking organizations with total assets less than $250.0 billion. The Company has adopted these new rules and does not feel they will have a material impact.\nIn addition to U.S. based regulatory initiatives, the federal government is also coordinating reform activities with other countries. There can be no assurance that these various initiatives or any other future legislative or regulatory initiatives will be successful at improving economic conditions globally, nationally or in our markets, or that the measures adopted will not adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nJACKSONVILLE BANCORP, INC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Cont.)\nWe are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements. If we fail to maintain sufficient capital, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our regulatory requirements, could be adversely affected.\nBoth Bancorp and the Bank must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient capital and liquidity and our regulators may modify and adjust such requirements in the future. The Bank\u2019s Board of Directors has agreed to a memorandum of understanding with the FDIC and the OFR for the Bank to maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.00% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.00%. As of December 31, 2014, the Bank was well capitalized for regulatory purposes and met the capital requirements of the 2012 MoU. If noncompliance or other events cause the Bank to become subject to formal enforcement action, the FDIC could determine that the Bank is no longer \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d for regulatory purposes. Failure to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to make distributions on our trust preferred securities, and our business, results of operation, liquidity and financial condition, generally.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems, losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We could also experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of other banks\u2019 difficulties or failure, which would increase the capital we need to support such growth.\nAs a member institution of the FDIC, we are assessed a quarterly deposit insurance premium. Bank failures have significantly depleted the FDIC\u2019s DIF and reduced its ratio of reserves to insured deposits. As a result, the FDIC has adopted a revised risk-based deposit insurance assessment schedule which raised deposit insurance premiums, and the FDIC has also implemented a special assessment on all depository institutions, which may be imposed in future periods if needed. Regulatory assessments were $0.7 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These assessments are included in noninterest expense and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\nDifficult market conditions have adversely affected and may continue to affect us and the financial services industry.\nWe are exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy and, particularly, in the local markets in which we operate in Florida. Declines in the housing markets, including falling home prices and low sales volumes, as well as foreclosures, have negatively affected the credit performance of mortgage and commercial real estate loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by the Bank and financial institutions in general, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers, including other financial institutions. This market turmoil and the tightening of credit have led to increased levels of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility, reduced real estate values and sales volumes, reduced credit availability for real estate borrowers and reductions in general business activities. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and borrowers and reduced confidence in the financial markets have historically adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nJACKSONVILLE BANCORP, INC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Cont.)\nAlthough the difficult conditions in the financial markets appear to be stabilizing or improving, a continuation or worsening of present conditions would likely have adverse effects on us and other financial institutions, including the following:\n\u2022 Reduced ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers or to estimate the value of assets, especially in regards to collateral securing existing loans. We estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure, the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and the values of certain assets by using estimates based on difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including estimates as to the effects of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might affect the value of assets or the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. If the models and approaches we use become less predictive of future behaviors, valuations, assumptions or estimates, the value of collateral, especially real estate, associated with existing loans may be reduced and consequently increase our credit risk exposure;\n\u2022 Reduced ability to raise capital or borrow funds from other financial institutions on favorable terms, or at all. The availability of capital or borrowed funds may also experience adverse effects from continued disruptions in the capital markets, or other events, including, among other things, changes in investor expectations; and\n\u2022 Failures of other depository institutions in our markets and increasing consolidation of financial services companies as a result of current market conditions could increase our deposits and assets, necessitating additional capital, and may have unexpected adverse effects upon our ability to compete effectively or attract capital as needed.\nOur results are significantly impacted by the economic conditions of our principal market areas.\nThe success of our operations depends on the general economic conditions of the State of Florida and the specific markets we serve. Unlike larger organizations that are more geographically diverse, our operations are concentrated in Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida and the surrounding areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, the economic conditions in our primary market areas have a significant impact on our financial results, including the demand for the Bank\u2019s products and services, the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of collateral securing existing loans, and the stability of our funding sources. This is particularly true because a number of our borrowers are small businesses that may be less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. Consequently, their ability to repay loans may be especially adversely affected during economic downturns which could lead to higher rates of loss and loan payment delinquencies. Moreover, the value of the real estate or other collateral that may secure our loans could be adversely affected if local economic conditions experience further deterioration. If a borrower is unable to repay its loan and the value of the underlying real estate collateral declines to a point that is below the amount of the loan, then we will suffer a loss.\nWeaknesses in the real estate markets, including the secondary market for residential mortgage loans, have adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us.\nFinancial institutions continue to be affected by ongoing challenges in real estate markets and secondary mortgage markets. Increased volatility in housing markets, combined with the correction in residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales, could result in further price reductions in single family home values and continue to adversely affect the liquidity and value of collateral securing our real estate-related loans. This is especially true for collateral securing commercial loans for residential land acquisition, construction and development, as well as residential mortgage loans and residential property securing loans currently outstanding. Additional consequences of continued deterioration of the housing markets include reduced mortgage loan originations and reduced gains on the sale of mortgage loans.\nDeclining real estate prices have caused higher delinquencies and losses on certain mortgage loans in general, and particularly with regard to second lien mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Significant ongoing disruptions in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans have limited the market for, and liquidity of, most residential mortgage loans other than conforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans. These trends could continue despite various government programs to boost the residential mortgage markets and stabilize the housing markets.\nOur financial condition, including capital and liquidity, and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by declines in real estate values and home sales volumes, financial stress on borrowers as a result\nJACKSONVILLE BANCORP, INC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Cont.)\nof unemployment, interest rate resets on adjustable rate mortgage loans or other factors that result in higher delinquencies and increased charge-offs related to credit losses. Furthermore, in the event that our allowance for loan losses is insufficient to cover such losses, our earnings, capital and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur concentration of real estate mortgage loans and loans secured by real estate may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 84.2% and 87.6% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of real estate mortgage loans, respectively. Commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) loans are especially cyclical and pose risks of loss to us due to concentration levels and similar risks of the asset. CRE loans represented 65.3% and 67.9% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Banking regulators continue to give CRE lending greater scrutiny and banks with higher levels of CRE loans are expected to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing. In addition, an increased concentration of CRE loans requires higher levels of allowances for possible losses and capital levels as a result of CRE lending growth and exposures. The downturn in the real estate market, the continued deterioration in the value of collateral, and the local and national economic recessions have adversely affected our customers\u2019 ability to sell or refinance real estate and repay their loans. If these conditions persist, or worsen, our customers\u2019 ability to repay their loans will be further eroded. In the event we are required to foreclose on a property securing one of our mortgage loans, or otherwise pursue remedies in order to protect our investment, we may be unable to recover enough value from the collateral to prevent a loss.\nThe amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default and foreclosure is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 general or local economic conditions;\n\u2022 environmental clean-up liability;\n\u2022 neighborhood values;\n\u2022 real estate tax rates;\n\u2022 operating expenses of the foreclosed properties;\n\u2022 ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties;\n\u2022 zoning laws, governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and\n\u2022 natural disasters.\nCertain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. In the event that the cost of operating real property exceeds the rental income earned from such property, we may be required to advance funds in order to protect our investment or dispose of the real property at a loss.\nCurrent levels of market volatility are significant, and negative conditions and new developments in the financial services industry and the credit markets have and may continue to adversely affect our operations, financial performance and stock price.\nThe capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for the past several years. The markets have placed downward pressure on stock prices and the availability of capital, credit and liquidity has been adversely affected for many issuers, in some cases, without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial condition or performance. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, we may experience adverse effects, which may be material, on our ability to maintain or access capital and credit, and on our business, financial condition (including liquidity) and results of operations.\nThe financial markets are experiencing adverse effects due to economic uncertainties, including its direction and growth, as well as high unemployment rates. As a result of a weaker economy and an historical decline in the value of collateral supporting loans, especially with respect to the State of Florida, many financial institutions have seen\nJACKSONVILLE BANCORP, INC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Cont.)\ndeterioration in loan portfolio performance. In addition, stock prices of bank holding companies, like us, have been negatively affected by the recent and current conditions in the financial markets, as has our ability to raise capital as needed, compared to the period preceding the latest economic recession.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market.\nWe face competition for deposits, loans and other financial services from other community banks, regional banks, out-of-state and in-state national banks, savings banks, thrifts, credit unions and other financial institutions. The Company also faces competition from other entities that provide financial services, including consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, mortgage brokers, insurance companies, mutual funds, and other lending sources and alternative investment providers. Some of these financial institutions and financial services organizations are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are and may have lower cost structures. Many of our competitors offer products and services different from us, and have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence than we do, which benefit them in attracting business. Larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we can, and have broader customer and geographic bases to draw upon. Failure to compete effectively to attract new and retain current customers could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe banking industry is also subject to increased competition as a result of rapid technological changes with the frequent introduction of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to providing better service to customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and may enable us to reduce costs. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional operating efficiencies. Many of our competitors, especially large national and regional banks, have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements, which may permit them to perform certain functions at a lower cost than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to implement new technology-driven products and services effectively or efficiently or be successful in marketing these to our customers, which may reduce our ability to compete effectively in the industry.\nWe could be negatively impacted by changes in interest rates.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by changes in interest rates or the yield curve, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Our profitability is largely a function of the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and those paid on deposits and other liabilities. Changes in interest rates may negatively affect our earnings and the value of our assets as well as our levels of interest income, interest expense and net interest spread and margin. If our assets reprice more slowly than our deposits and other liabilities, our earnings will be adversely affected if interest rates rise, but will benefit if the interest rates on our earning assets rise more quickly than the interest rates we pay on our deposits and other liabilities. Most banks, including us, have experienced compression and reduced interest spreads and margins as a result of current historically low interest rates. Our interest spreads and net interest margins are also affected by the shape of the yield curve, which is affected especially by monetary policy, including the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions to keep interest rates low in recent years. While we seek to manage our interest-rate risk, these measures are based on estimates and assumptions that may not be realized.\nWe have incurred losses in recent years and there is no assurance that current income will be sustained or that additional losses will not occur in future periods.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred a net loss of $960 thousand. In response to recent losses, management raised additional capital and implemented a strategy to accelerate the disposal of substandard assets in order to strengthen the Company\u2019s balance sheet, increase tangible common equity and improve capital adequacy ratios applicable to Bancorp and the Bank. These initiatives have resulted in general improvements to the Company\u2019s financial condition, asset quality and results of operations as evidenced by the continued reduction in substandard assets and net income of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. While management believes that these strategies will continue to improve our financial condition and results of operations going forward, there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that additional losses will not occur in future periods.\nJACKSONVILLE BANCORP, INC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Cont.)\nChanges in accounting and tax rules applicable to banks and bank holding companies could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in us restating prior period financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to operational risk may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilar to other financial institutions, the Company and its subsidiaries are exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, the risk that sensitive customer or Company data may be compromised, and the risk of operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors. The Company seeks to mitigate operational risks through a system of internal controls; however, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or result in a reduction of the intended risk exposure. Failure to do so may result in losses incurred by the Company, including explicit charges, increased operational costs in the form of noninterest expenses, litigation costs, harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, and forgone opportunities with regards to future growth. Such losses may have a materially adverse effect on the business, our financial condition and results of operations.\nReputational risk and social factors may impact our results of operations.\nOur ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon customer and other external perceptions of our business practices and financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our business practices or financial health could damage our reputation in both the customer and funding markets, leading to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. Adverse developments with respect to the consumer or other external perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or the financial services industry as a whole, may also adversely impact our reputation. Negative public opinion surrounding our Company or our industry may also result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws, regulations or regulatory actions that may change or constrain the manner in which we engage with our customers and the products we offer. Adverse reputational impacts or events may also increase our litigation risk.\nThe loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success is, and is expected to remain, highly dependent on our senior management team. We rely heavily on our senior management because, as a community bank, our management\u2019s extensive knowledge of, and relationships in, the community generates business for us. Successful execution of our business strategies will continue to place significant demands on our management and the loss of any such persons\u2019 services may adversely affect our ability to resolve these problems, recapitalize the Company, grow and remain profitable.\nOn December 4, 2013, the Company appointed Kendall L. Spencer as President and Chief Executive Officer to provide advanced leadership and commercial banking management expertise as well as additional proficiencies in strategic financial planning and execution of operational initiatives. On September 2, 2014, the Company appointed Joseph W. Amy as Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer to replace Margaret A. Incandela who resigned from that position effective August 29, 2014. We also continue to rely upon the services of Scott M. Hall, Executive Vice President and the Bank\u2019s President, and Valerie A. Kendall, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. If the services of these individuals were to become unavailable for any reason, or if we were unable to hire highly qualified and experienced personnel to replace them, our results and financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to environmental liability risk with respect to other real estate owned.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We have been aggressively managing problem assets and, as a result, have taken title to the underlying\nJACKSONVILLE BANCORP, INC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Cont.)\ncollateral for a number of underperforming loans. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $4.1 million in other real estate owned. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third persons for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur lending limit restricts our ability to compete with larger financial institutions and may limit our growth.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our per customer lending limit was approximately $12.9 million, subject to further reduction based on regulatory criteria relevant to any particular loan. Accordingly, the size of loans which we can offer to potential customers is less than the size that many of our competitors with larger lending limits are able to offer. This limit has affected and will continue to affect our ability to seek relationships with larger businesses in the market. We seek to accommodate loans in excess of our lending limit through the sale of portions of such loans to other banks although this market has been disrupted from time to time in recent years, as other banks have exited the market or failed, and we may lose loans to competitors. Our lending limit also impacts the efficiency of our lending activities because it lowers our average loan size, which means we have to generate an increased number of transactions in order to achieve the same portfolio volume as other institutions with higher lending limits.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk as a result of reliance on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\nThe Company often relies on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties when deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions. Financial statements, credit reports, and related financial information are considered in conjunction with certain representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties for which there are limited opportunities for management to independently verify. For example, management may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Reliance on materially misleading information with regards to lending arrangements could have a materially adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio and may result in additional losses in the event of borrower default. Such effects may adversely impact the Company\u2019s overall asset quality, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the quality of our assets, particularly loans. In originating loans, there is a substantial likelihood that credit losses will be experienced. The risk of loss will vary with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the quality of the collateral for the loan. Management maintains an allowance for loan losses based on, among other things, anticipated experience, an evaluation of economic conditions, and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality. Based upon such factors, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for probable loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans when their ultimate collectability is considered questionable. Our regulators may also require us to add to our provision for loan losses in the ordinary course of their review of the Bank.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses was $14.4 million which represented 3.83% of our gross loan portfolio as of the same date. Nonperforming assets consisted of approximately $9.2 million in nonperforming loans and $4.1 million in other real estate owned. Management monitors our asset quality and seeks to maintain an adequate loan loss allowance; however, the allowance may not prove sufficient to cover future loan losses. Furthermore, although management uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the\nJACKSONVILLE BANCORP, INC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Cont.)\nassumptions used or adverse developments arise with respect to our nonperforming or performing loans. Accordingly, the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover loan losses, or significant increases to the allowance may be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen. Among other adverse consequences, significant additions to our allowance for loan losses could have a material impact on our financial performance and reduce our net income and capital.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and expose us to increased risk of loss.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our nonperforming loans were $9.2 million, or 2.5% of our gross loan portfolio, and our nonperforming assets (which include nonperforming loans) were $13.3 million, or 2.7% of total assets. In addition, we had approximately $6.8 million in loans past due 30-89 days and still accruing interest as of December 31, 2014. The Company experienced a decrease in nonperforming assets of approximately $6.8 million from the prior year ended December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, our nonperforming loans were $17.0 million, or 4.6% of our gross loan portfolio, and our nonperforming assets (which include nonperforming loans) were $20.1 million, or 4.0% of total assets. In addition, we had approximately $5.9 million in accruing loans that were 30-89 days delinquent as of December 31, 2013.\nWe do not record interest income on nonperforming loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our income and increasing our loan administration costs. We also incur the costs of funding problem assets and other real estate owned. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its then fair value less our expected selling costs, which, when compared to the principal amount of the loan, may result in a loss. In addition, given the increased levels of mortgage foreclosures in our market areas, the foreclosure process is now taking longer than it has in recent years; this has served to increase the cost of foreclosures and the time needed to take title to the underlying property. Once we take possession of foreclosed real estate, the costs of maintenance, taxes, security and potential environmental liability can be significant and serve to decrease the amount of recovery we may realize upon a sale of the property.\nAs described above, our nonperforming assets can adversely affect our net income in a variety of ways, which negatively affects our results of operations and financial condition. While we have used loan sales, workouts, restructurings and other activities to improve our level of problem assets, decreases in the value of these assets, or the underlying collateral, or in the related borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. Until economic and market conditions significantly improve, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an increase in nonperforming assets in future periods. As a result, we may continue to incur additional losses related to nonperforming assets, including losses on the potential disposition of loans and foreclosed assets.\nWe have had to adjust the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and reduce our deferred tax asset to zero.\nWe evaluate deferred tax assets for recoverability based on all available evidence. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results. As of the end of 2011, the Company established a valuation allowance for all our deferred tax assets, based on available evidence at the time, that it was more-likely-than-not that all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. In determining the more-likely-than-not criterion, management evaluates all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, the Company determined that the need for a full valuation allowance still existed. Future adjustments, either increases or decreases, to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry-back or carry-forward periods under the tax law.\nDue to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, we may or may not be able to recapture these deferred tax assets in future periods.\nJACKSONVILLE BANCORP, INC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Cont.)\nOur location on the east coast of Florida makes us susceptible to disruptions in operations due to weather-related problems.\nOur Bank branches and corporate headquarters are located in the Jacksonville and Jacksonville Beach, Duval County, Florida area and are vulnerable to tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes and flood and wind damage. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future weather events will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas. Such weather events could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in payment delinquencies, foreclosures or loan losses. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of future weather events. Many of our customers have incurred significantly higher property and casualty insurance premiums on their properties located in our markets, which may adversely affect real estate sales and values in our markets.\nSystem failures, interruptions or breaches of security could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nTechnology and information systems are essential to our daily business operations, such as systems to manage accounting activities, customer deposits and loan operations. In addition, the Bank provides its customers the ability to bank online. While the Company has established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions and security breaches, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, the secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is a critical element of online banking. The Bank\u2019s network or those of its customers could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security problems. In order to mitigate these risks, the Bank may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could expose the Bank to litigation or other liabilities and also cause existing customers to lose confidence in the Bank\u2019s systems which could adversely affect our reputation and the ability to generate deposits, and, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company's business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company's business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While the Company has selected these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problem caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failures of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect the Company's ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt the Company's operations if those difficulties interface with the vendor's ability to serve the Company. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to the Company's business operations.\nWe are dependent on the operating performance of the Bank to provide us with operating funds in the form of cash dividends, and the Bank is subject to regulatory limitations regarding the payment of dividends.\nWe are a bank holding company and, in the ordinary course of business, are dependent upon dividends from the Bank for funds to pay expenses and, if declared, cash dividends to shareholders. A Florida state-chartered commercial bank may not pay cash dividends that would cause the bank\u2019s capital to fall below the minimum amount required by federal or state law. Accordingly, commercial banks may only pay dividends out of the total of current net profits plus retained net profits of the preceding two years to the extent it deems expedient, except no bank may pay a dividend at any time that the total of net income for the current year when combined with retained net income from the preceding two years, produces a loss. In addition, banks may not pay a dividend if the dividend would result in the bank being \u201cundercapitalized\u201d for prompt corrective action purposes, or would violate any minimum capital requirement specified by law or the Bank\u2019s regulators. The Bank cannot currently pay dividends without prior regulatory approval. Therefore, the Bank may not be able to provide Bancorp with adequate funds to conduct ongoing operations, which would adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nJACKSONVILLE BANCORP, INC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Cont.)\nMore specifically, reduced liquidity may adversely affect Bancorp\u2019s ability to pay interest on material company debt in the form of junior subordinated debt related to its trust preferred securities. As of December 31, 2014, Bancorp had approximately $16.2 million of junior subordinated debentures issued incident to trust preferred securities and another $0.9 million of other liabilities. Bancorp has depended on the revolving loan agreements with its directors, cash on hand, and net proceeds from capital raise transactions to pay its operating expenses and interest expenses related to its material debt obligations. As of December 31, 2014, Bancorp had approximately $1.8 million of cash on hand and $2.2 million in funds available under its revolving loan agreements. There is no assurance that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet Bancorp\u2019s expenses going forward.\nOur business may face significant risks with respect to future expansion.\nTo supplement our current growth strategy, we may continue to acquire other financial institutions or parts of financial institutions in the future and we may engage in additional de novo branch expansion. Acquisitions and mergers involve a number of risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022 the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners, and negotiations and consummation of any such transactions;\n\u2022 the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate;\n\u2022 the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022 our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022 the diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;\n\u2022 entry into new markets where we lack experience;\n\u2022 the introduction of new products and services into our business;\n\u2022 the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with an acquisition and possible adverse effects on our results of operations; and\n\u2022 the risk of loss of key employees and customers.\nWe may incur substantial costs to expand and can give no assurance that such expansion will result in the levels of profits we would expect. We may issue equity securities, including common stock, in connection with future acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our shareholders. There is no assurance that, following any future mergers or acquisitions, our integration efforts will be successful or, after giving effect to the acquisition, that we will achieve profits comparable to, or better than, our historical experience.\nFuture liquidity needs may exceed our available liquidity sources.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could limit our asset growth and have a materially adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Our funding sources include federal funds purchases, non-core deposits, and short- and long-term debt. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, where we can obtain advances collateralized with eligible assets. The Bank can also use eligible collateral to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity.\nOther sources of liquidity may be available to us on an as-needed basis, including additional non-core deposits (subject to applicable regulatory restrictions, if any), the sale of debt securities, and the issuance and sale of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms which are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired\nJACKSONVILLE BANCORP, INC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Cont.)\nby factors that are not specific to us, such as further disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and elevated levels of volatility and disruption in the credit markets.\nAdditional capital may not be available when needed and, if available, could result in dilution of our shareholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nAny capital that is generated by our operations over the next several years is expected to be needed to support our operations. Additionally, our Board may determine from time to time that we need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities. These issuances likely would dilute the ownership interest of our then-current shareholders, including the per share book value of our common stock and nonvoting common stock and would only require shareholder approval under certain circumstances. The terms of security issuances by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants, which may have a further dilutive effect on current ownership interests. Also, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs, whether or not an offering is completed successfully. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe are currently authorized to issue up to 20.0 million shares of common stock, 5.0 million shares of nonvoting common stock, and 10.0 million shares of preferred stock, of which 3,180,300 shares, 2,614,821 shares and no shares, respectively, were issued and outstanding as of February 27, 2015. Our Board has the authority, and in certain circumstances without shareholder approval, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued common stock or nonvoting common stock, and to establish the terms of any series of preferred stock. Any authorized but unissued shares could be issued on terms or in circumstances that could dilute the interests of other shareholders, including the book value of each share of our common stock and nonvoting common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nShares of capital stock are not an insured deposit.\nShares of our common stock and nonvoting common stock are not a bank deposit and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Investment in our capital stock is subject to investment risk, which could result in a loss of the entire investment.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and, therefore, shareholders and investors may have difficulty selling shares.\nOur common stock is thinly traded, which can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market. We cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, and our shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at the volumes, prices, or times that they desire, or at all.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market could depress the stock price of our common stock and the value of our other securities.\nThrough multiple capital raise transactions completed during 2012 and 2013, the Company registered an additional 5.5 million shares of its common stock and nonvoting common stock. Each share of nonvoting common stock will automatically convert into one share of common stock in the event of a \u201cpermitted transfer\u201d to a transferee. Shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and nonvoting common stock issued in the capital raise transactions have been registered for resale with the SEC and are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Sales of substantial amounts of these shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or other securities. Also, these sales might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities at a time and price that we otherwise would deem appropriate.\nJACKSONVILLE BANCORP, INC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Cont.)\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that dividends will be paid on our common stock or nonvoting common stock for the foreseeable future and intend to retain all earnings, if any, to support our business. Future dividend payments will depend on Bancorp\u2019s internal dividend policy, earnings, capital and regulatory requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by the Board.\nA Florida state-chartered commercial bank may not pay cash dividends that would cause the bank\u2019s capital to fall below the minimum amount required by federal or state law. Accordingly, commercial banks may only pay dividends out of the total of current net profits plus retained net profits of the preceding two years to the extent it deems expedient, except as follows: No bank may pay a dividend at any time that the total of net income for the current year, when combined with retained net income from the preceding two years, produces a loss. The Bank met this restriction in 2014 as our net income for the year combined with retained earnings from the preceding two years produced a loss. The future ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Bancorp will also depend in part on the FDIC capital requirements in effect at such time and our ability to comply with such requirements.", "PERMNO": 89529, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "JAXB"}
