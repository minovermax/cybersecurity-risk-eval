{"cik": "1023734", "company": "BPZ RESOURCES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Bankruptcy.\nBPZ Resources, Inc. (the \u201cDebtor\u201d) filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on March 9, 2015 (the \u201cChapter 11 Case\u201d) and is subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 cases. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Case, our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks and uncertainties include:\n\u25cf\nour ability to develop, prosecute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 Case;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in the Chapter 11 Case from time to time;\n\u25cf\nthe actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in the Chapter 11 Case that may be inconsistent with our plans;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a plan of reorganization, to appoint a U.S. trustee or to convert the Chapter 11 Case to a Chapter 7 case;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain and maintain normal payment and other terms with customers, vendors and service providers;\n\u25cf\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees;\n\u25cf\nour ability to retain key vendors or secure alternative supply sources;\n\u25cf\nour ability to fund and execute our business plan;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain acceptable and appropriate financing, including debtor-in-possession financing if required; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with the Chapter 11 Case could adversely affect our relationships with our vendors and employees, as well as with customers, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, we need Bankruptcy Court approval for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond timely to events or take advantage of opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Case, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 proceedings will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is no certainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm included under Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Case, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. While operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, and subject to Bankruptcy Court, approval or otherwise as permitted in the normal course of business, we may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.\nA plan of reorganization or liquidation may result in holders of our capital stock receiving very limited or no distribution on account of their interests and cancellation of their existing stock. If certain requirements of the Bankruptcy Code are met, a Chapter 11 plan or reorganization can be confirmed notwithstanding its rejection by our equity securityholders and notwithstanding the fact that such equity securityholders do not receive or retain any property on account of their equity interests under the plan.\nOperating under Bankruptcy Court protection for a long period of time may harm our business. Our future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization. A long period of operations under Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Case continue, our senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. A prolonged period of operating under Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, the longer the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Case continue, the more likely it is that our customers and suppliers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our businesses successfully and will seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nFurthermore, so long as the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Case continue, we will be required to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 Case. The Chapter 11 Case filing will also likely require us to seek debtor-in-possession financing to fund operations. If we are unable to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all, our chances of successfully reorganizing our business may be seriously jeopardized, the likelihood that we instead will be required to liquidate our assets may be enhanced, and, as a result, any securities in the Debtor could become further devalued or become worthless.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the liabilities that will be subject to a plan of reorganization. Even once a plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders to do business with a company that recently emerged from Chapter 11 proceedings.\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization. To emerge successfully from Bankruptcy Court protection as a viable entity, we must meet certain statutory requirements with respect to adequacy of disclosure with respect to a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, solicit and obtain the requisite acceptances of such a plan and fulfill other statutory conditions for confirmation of such a plan, which have not occurred to date. The confirmation process is subject to numerous, unanticipated potential delays, including a delay in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s commencement of the confirmation hearing regarding our plan.\nWe may not receive the requisite acceptances of constituencies in the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Case to confirm our Plan. Even if the requisite acceptances of our Plan are received, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm such a plan. The precise requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming a plan, notwithstanding its rejection by one or more impaired classes of claims or equity interests, depends upon a number of factors including, without limitation, the status and seniority of the claims or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e., secured claims or unsecured claims, subordinated or senior claims, preferred or common stock).\nIf a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if anything, holders of claims against us would ultimately receive with respect to their claims.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Case, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability. The Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation and specified debts arising afterwards. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to March 9, 2015 and before confirmation of a plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise or treatment under the plan of reorganization or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged by the Bankruptcy Court could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nEven if a Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face risks. Even if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face a number of risks, including certain risks that are beyond our control, such as further deterioration or other changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry, potential revaluing of our assets due to Chapter 11 proceedings, changes in consumer demand for, and acceptance of, our oil and gas and increasing expenses. Some of these concerns and effects typically become more acute when a case under the Bankruptcy Code continues for a protracted period without indication of how or when the case may be completed. As a result of these risks and others, there is no guaranty that a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization reflecting the Plan will achieve our stated goals.\nIn addition, at the outset of the Chapter 11 Case, the Bankruptcy Code gives the Debtor the exclusive right to propose the Plan and prohibited creditors, equity security holders and others from proposing a plan. We have currently retained the exclusive right to propose the Plan. If the Bankruptcy Court terminates that right, however, or the exclusivity period expires, there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve confirmation of the Plan in order to achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, even if our debts are reduced or discharged through the Plan, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Case. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms.\nTransfers of our equity, or issuances of equity in connection with our restructuring, may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards in the future. Under federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income in any year net operating losses carried forward from prior years. We have net operating loss carryforwards related to the Debtor of approximately $163.0 million as of December 31, 2014. Our ability to deduct net operating loss carryforwards will be subject to a significant limitation if we were to undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, during or as a result of our Chapter 11 proceedings and we are unable to qualify for the exception to the carryforward limit for corporations that have changed ownership under a Chapter 11 plan. Our ability to deduct net operating loss carryforwards would be reduced by the amount of any cancellation of debt income resulting from the proposed restructuring that is allocable to the Debtor.\nOur financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends. While in bankruptcy, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the filing of the Chapter 11 Case. In addition, if we emerge from bankruptcy, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. In addition, if we emerge from bankruptcy, we may be required to adopt fresh start accounting. If fresh start accounting is applicable, our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date. The fair value of our assets and liabilities may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, if fresh start accounting is required, our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting may be different from historical trends.\nOur successful reorganization will depend on our ability to motivate key employees and successfully implement new strategies. Our success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our people. In particular, the successful implementation of our business plan and our ability to successfully consummate a plan of reorganization will be highly dependent upon our management. Our ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees is restricted by provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, which limit or prevent our ability to implement a retention program or take other measures intended to motivate key employees to remain with the Company during the pendency of the bankruptcy. In addition, we must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of employment contracts and other employee compensation programs. The loss of the services of such individuals or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the implementation of our business plan, including our restructuring program, and on our ability to successfully reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy.\nThe prices of our debt and equity securities are volatile and, in connection with our reorganization, holders of our securities may receive no payment, or payment that is less than the face value or purchase price of such securities. The market price for our common stock has been volatile and our current common stock could be cancelled for no value or current stockholders could be substantially diluted under an agreement we reach with a group of our bondholders. Prices for our debt securities are also volatile and prices for such securities have generally been substantially below par. We can make no assurance that the price of our securities will not fluctuate or decrease substantially in the future. See \u201c-- Our shares are subject to risks associated with trading in an over-the-counter market\u201d for discussion of the risks of the Debtor\u2019s securities trading in the over-the-counter market.\nAccordingly, trading in our securities is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of such securities, as holders may not be able to resell such securities or, in connection with our reorganization, may receive no payment, or a payment or other consideration that is less than the par value or the purchase price of such securities.\nRisks Relating to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry, the Power Industry, and Our Business.\nOil and natural gas prices are highly volatile. A substantial or extended decline in oil prices and, to a limited extent, natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity or results of operations as well as our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments necessary to implement our business plan. Any revenues, cash flow, profitability and future rate of growth we achieve will be greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and gas. Our borrowing capacity and ability to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also dependent on oil and gas prices.\nHistorically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. The price of oil per barrel has dropped precipitously by more than half since its high in June 2014. Oil and natural gas are commodities and their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. Those factors include among others:\n\u25cf\ninternational political conditions (including wars and civil unrest, such as the recent unrest in the Middle East);\n\u25cf\nthe domestic and foreign supply of oil and gas;\n\u25cf\nthe level of consumer demand;\n\u25cf\nweather conditions;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and other actions;\n\u25cf\nactions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d);\n\u25cf\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u25cf\noverall global economic conditions.\nLower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any, and, as such, may have a negative impact on our reserves. A continuation of low or significant declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and borrowing capacity, and may require a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and other assets. While our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and gas prices increase significantly, exploration and production costs and acquisition costs for additional properties and reserves may also increase. We currently do not enter into hedging arrangements or use derivative financial instruments such as crude oil forward and swap contracts to hedge our risk associated with fluctuations in commodity prices.\nOur reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and the calculation of the estimated value of reserves.\nIn order to prepare our reserve estimates, our independent petroleum engineers must project production rates and timing of development expenditures as well as analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The quality and reliability of this data can vary which in turn can have an effect on our reserve estimations. The process of estimating reserves also requires economic assumptions about matters, such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise, and can vary.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from our estimates, and those variances may be material. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and estimated value of our reserves.\nWe continue to assess new data we have collected or will collect in the near future, including the continuing assessment of acquired 3-D seismic data, analysis of cores drawn or to be drawn from our drilling program, production from our recent drilling program and planned acquisition of additional two dimensional (\u201c2-D\u201d) and 3-D seismic data. The results of our assessments could affect reported reserves. In addition, our independent petroleum engineers may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, drilling results, prevailing oil and natural gas prices, availability of funds and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the estimated value of our proved reserves prepared in accordance with the SEC\u2019s guidelines is the current market value of our estimated oil reserves. We base the estimated value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves on an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month during the 12-month calendar year and year-end costs. Actual future prices, costs, taxes and the volume of produced reserves may differ materially from those used in the estimated value.\nWe have entered into a significant joint venture that may limit our operations and corporate flexibility in Block Z-1; actions taken by our joint venture partner in Block Z-1 may materially impact our financial position and results of operation, and we may not realize the benefits we expect from this joint venture. Various aspects of our Pacific Rubiales joint venture could materially impact us: The development of Block Z-1 is subject to the terms and conditions of a Joint Operating Agreement and we no longer have unlimited flexibility to control the development of this property. We share approval rights over major decisions and overall supervision of joint operations through a joint operating committee. Pacific Rubiales may have interests and goals that are inconsistent with ours. The performance of our joint venture partner\u2019s obligations under the Joint Operating Agreement is outside of our direct control. The ability or failure of our joint venture partner to pay its funding commitment could increase our costs of operations or result in reduced drilling and production of oil and gas, or loss of rights to develop Block Z-1. In addition, the ability or failure of us to pay for our share of the funding commitment could impair our ability to participate in the benefits of those projects and operations and may result in the loss of our rights to develop Block Z-1 with our joint operating partner. These restrictions may preclude transactions that could be beneficial to our shareholders. Pacific Rubiales is the technical operator of the field under an Operating Services Agreement. Their ability to deliver the continued safe and efficient operations of the Block under this agreement will have a material impact on us. Disputes between us and our joint venture partner, or actions taken by our joint venture partner, may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate projects and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.\nWe have not been profitable since we commenced operations and have historically had limited earnings from operations. To date, we have been unable to support our exploration and development activities solely through earnings from operations. At times when we have had a working capital surplus, the sources of our working capital surplus have generally been equity issuances, debt financings and asset sales, rather than revenue from operations, and we may incur working capital deficits in the future. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be profitable in the future or that we will be able to generate cash from operations or financings to fund working capital deficits.\nWe require additional financing for the exploration and development of our oil and gas properties and the construction of our proposed power generation facility, pipeline and gas processing facility. Since becoming a public company in 2004, we have funded our operations with the net proceeds of sales of securities, debt financing and the sale of a 49% participating interest in Block Z-1 for $150.0 million in 2012. We began to generate revenues from operations in the fourth quarter of 2007. We will need additional financing to fully implement our development plan. As we continue to execute our business plan and expand our operations, our cash generation from operations along with our commitments are likely to increase and, therefore, the likelihood of our seeking additional financing, either through the equity markets, debt financing, joint ventures, asset sales or a combination thereof may occur. If we are unable to timely generate or obtain adequate funds to finance our exploration and development plans, our ability to develop our oil and natural gas reserves may be limited or substantially delayed. In addition, if we are unable to fund our commitments under the joint venture with Pacific Rubiales, we could lose certain rights to develop Block Z-1. Such limitations or delays could result in a failure to realize the full potential value of our properties (and could affect the value of our properties as recorded in our financial statements) or could result in the potential loss of our oil and gas properties if we were unable to meet our obligations under the license agreements, which could, in turn, limit our ability to repay our debts.\nIn addition, inability to timely generate or obtain funds also could cause us to delay, scale back or abandon our plans for construction of our power generation facility, pipelines and gas processing facility, possibly resulting in further asset impairment charges. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred impairments of $58.0 million related to our power plant and related equipment, due to recent developments, including Chapter 11 reorganization, that may change the extent or manner in which the asset may be used.\nWe may obtain future amounts required to fund our activities through additional equity and debt financing, joint venture arrangements, the sale of oil and gas interests, and/or future cash flows from operations. However, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms. The exact nature and terms of such funding sources are unknown at this time, and there can be no assurance that we will obtain such funding or have funding available to adequately finance our future operations.\nChanges in the financial and credit market may impact economic growth and may also affect our ability to obtain funding on acceptable terms. Global financial markets and economic conditions have been disruptive and volatile. Accordingly, the equity capital markets can become exceedingly distressed. Market discontinuities, credit risk pricing and weak economic conditions can make it difficult to obtain debt or equity capital funding. In addition, debt securities generally are susceptible to interest rate risk, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates.\nDue to these and possibly other factors, we cannot be certain funding will be available when and if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. If funding is not available as needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to implement our exploratory and development plan, enhance our existing business, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.\nOur business involves many uncertainties and operating risks that may prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses. Our exploration and production activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including weather, the drilling of dry holes, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling of a natural gas or oil well will not ensure we will realize a profit on our investment. A variety of factors, including geological, regulatory and market-related factors can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economical. Our business involves a variety of operating risks, including among others:\n\u25cf\nfires;\n\u25cf\nexplosions;\n\u25cf\nblow-outs and surface cratering;\n\u25cf\nuncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil and formation water;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u25cf\npipe, cement, subsea well or pipeline failures;\n\u25cf\ncasing collapses;\n\u25cf\nmechanical difficulties, such as lost or stuck oil field drilling and service tools;\n\u25cf\nabnormally pressured formations; or\n\u25cf\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases.\nExperiencing any of these operating risks could lead to problems with any well bores, platforms, barges, gathering systems and processing facilities, which could adversely affect our present and future drilling operations. Affected drilling operations could further lead to substantial losses as a result of:\n\u25cf\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u25cf\nsevere damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u25cf\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u25cf\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u25cf\nregulatory requirements, investigations and penalties;\n\u25cf\nsuspension of our operations; or\n\u25cf\nrepairs to resume operations.\nIf any of these risks occur, we may have to curtail or suspend any drilling or production operations and we could have our oil sales interrupted or suspended, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, operations and ability to execute our business plan.\nWe have a limited operating history and have only been in commercial production in our Block Z-1 since November 2010. We are in the initial stages of developing our oil and natural gas reserves. We have transitioned from an extended well testing program into commercial production in the Corvina and Albacora fields in our Block Z-1 and have produced and sold oil under extended well testing programs in both fields in the past. We are also subject to all of the risks inherent in attempting to expand a relatively new business venture. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the possible inability to profitably operate our existing properties or properties to be acquired in the future, our possible inability to fully fund the development requirements of such properties, our possible inability to raise adequate amounts of debt or equity capital to meet our development obligations and our possible inability to acquire additional properties that will have a positive effect on our operations. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve a level of profitability that will provide a return on invested capital or that will result in an increase in the market value of our securities. Accordingly, we are subject to the risk that because of these factors and other general business risks noted throughout these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d we may not be able to profitably execute our plan of operation.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 69% of our estimated net proved reserves were undeveloped. There can be no assurance that all of these reserves will ultimately be developed or produced. We own rights to oil and gas properties that have limited or no development. We can provide no guarantees that our properties will be developed profitably or that the potential oil and gas resources on the property will produce as expected if they are developed.\nRecovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. We have prepared estimates of our oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards. However, the estimated costs may not be accurate, development may not occur as scheduled, or the actual results may not be as estimated. Our estimates of reserves may change from time to time depending upon our ability to produce such reserves in a timely manner. We may not have or be able to obtain the capital we need to develop these proved reserves.\nWe may not be able to drill proved undeveloped reserve locations included in our proved oil reserves that are scheduled to be drilled five years from initial disclosure of the related reserves. We may not be able to drill proved undeveloped locations scheduled to be drilled five years after their initial disclosure. This may result from unexpected governmental permitting delays, facilities limitations on the CX-11 offshore platform and contractual, as well as construction issues related to the CX-15 offshore platform in Block Z-1 located in environmentally sensitive remote locations. These proved undeveloped reserves are located in areas where we continue to actively drill. Proved undeveloped reserves scheduled to be drilled after the initial five year period could be, based on available precedent, challenged by regulatory authorities and there is a risk that our reserves would have to be revised to exclude these reserves.\nWe may not be able to replace our reserves. Our future success will depend upon our ability to find, acquire and develop oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Any reserves we develop will decline as they are produced unless we are able to conduct successful revitalization activities or are able to replace the reserves by acquiring properties containing proven reserves, or both. To develop reserves and achieve production, we must implement our development and production programs, identify and produce previously overlooked or by-passed zones and shut-in wells, acquire additional properties or undertake other replacement activities. We can give no assurance that our planned development, revitalization, and acquisition activities will result in significant reserves replacement or that we will have success in discovering and producing reserves economically. We may not be able to locate geologically satisfactory property, particularly since we will be competing for such property with other oil and gas companies, most of which have much greater financial resources than we do. Moreover, even if desirable properties are available to us, we may not have sufficient funds with which to acquire or develop them.\nAny failure to meet our debt obligations, including our Convertible Notes due 2015 or our Convertible Notes due 2017, would adversely affect our business and financial condition. We currently have the following convertible notes outstanding: (i) $59.9 million principal amount of the 2015 Convertible Notes, which bear interest semi-annually at a rate of 6.50% per year, and (ii) $168.7 million principal amount of the 2017 Convertible Notes, which bear interest semi-annually at a rate of 8.50% per year. The 2015 Convertible Notes matured with repayment of $59.9 million due on March 1, 2015. We exercised a provision under the indenture governing the 2015 Convertible Notes providing for a 10-day grace period on principal due and a 30-day grace period on interest due for a total amount due of approximately $62 million. The grace period on the principal amount due expired on March 10, 2015 and the grace period for interest amount due will expire on March 30, 2015. As a result of our decision to not pay the principal and interest on the 2015 Convertible Notes when due on March 1, 2015 and after exercise of the grace period until March 10, 2015, a cross default provision contained on the 2017 Convertible Notes was triggered. In addition, on March 9, 2015, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, which was an event of default under the Indentures for the 2015 Convertible Notes and the 2017 Convertible Notes. Therefore all of our debt and related interest is considered due and callable once the default provisions were triggered. The ability of the holders of the 2015 Convertible Notes and the 2017 Convertible Notes to seek remedies and enforce their rights under the Indentures was automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Case, and the creditors\u2019 rights of enforcement are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nAs a result of the events of default, all debt has been classified as current at December 31, 2014. In addition, our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm included under Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Our ability to meet our current and future debt obligations and other expenses will depend on the outcome of our Chapter 11 restructuring and our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we are unable to control. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our future debt, we may be required to refinance the debt, sell assets or sell shares of common stock on terms that we do not find attractive, if it can be done at all.\nOur future operating revenue depends upon the performance of our properties. Our future operating revenue depends upon our ability to profitably operate our existing properties by drilling and completing wells that produce commercial quantities of oil and gas and our ability to expand our operations through the successful implementation of our plans to explore, acquire and develop additional properties. The successful development of oil and gas properties requires an assessment of potential recoverable reserves, future oil and gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors. Such assessments are necessarily inexact. No assurance can be given that we can produce sufficient revenue to operate our existing properties or acquire additional oil and gas producing properties and leases. We may not discover or successfully produce any recoverable reserves in the future, or we may not be able to make a profit from the reserves that we may discover. In addition, we regularly bring wells on or offline depending on technical performance, work-over requirements and, if applicable, testing period requirements. In the event that we are unable to produce sufficient operating revenue to fund our future operations, we will be forced to seek additional third-party funding, if such funding can be obtained. Such options would possibly include debt financing, sale of equity interests, joint venture arrangements, or the sale of oil and gas interests. If we are unable to secure such financing on a timely basis, we could be required to delay or scale back our operations. If such unavailability of funds continued for an extended period of time, this could result in the termination of our operations and the loss of an investor\u2019s entire investment.\nFuture oil and natural gas price declines or unsuccessful exploration efforts may result in significant charges or a write-down of our asset carrying values. We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our investments in oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, oil and gas lease acquisition costs and intangible drilling costs associated with exploration efforts that result in the discovery of proved reserves and costs associated with development drilling, whether or not successful, are capitalized when incurred. Certain costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determinations that proved reserves have been discovered. If proved reserves are not discovered with an exploratory well, the costs of drilling the well are expensed.\nIf the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, on a field basis, exceed the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of that field, we must write down the costs of that field to our estimate of its fair value. Unproved properties are evaluated at the lower of cost or fair value. Accordingly, a significant decline in oil or natural gas prices or unsuccessful exploration efforts could cause a future write-down of our capitalized oil and natural gas property costs. In addition, if we are unable to find a market for gas from our onshore gas wells in Peru or no significant further activities are conducted on such wells, we may write off the costs of such wells.\nWe evaluate impairment of our proved oil and gas properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset\u2019s carrying amount may not be recoverable. In addition, write-downs would occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties cannot be reversed at a later date even if oil or natural gas prices increase.\nOur oil and gas operations involve substantial costs and are subject to various economic risks. Our oil and gas operations are subject to the economic risks typically associated with exploration, development and production activities, including the necessity of significant expenditures to locate and acquire producing properties and to drill exploratory wells. The cost and length of time necessary to produce any reserves may be such that it will not be economically viable. In conducting exploration and development activities, the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations, miscalculations or accidents may cause our exploration, development and production activities to be unsuccessful. In addition, the cost and timing of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain. We also face the risk that the oil and/or gas reserves may be less than anticipated, that we will not have sufficient funds to successfully drill on the property, that we will not be able to market the oil and/or gas due to a lack of a market and that fluctuations in the prices of oil and/or gas will make development of those wells uneconomical. This could result in a total loss of our investments made in our operations.\nWe conduct offshore exploration, exploitation and production operations off the coast of northwest Peru, all of which are also subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment. Such risks include collisions, groundings and damage or loss from adverse weather conditions or interference from commercial or artesian fishing activities. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities, tankers and vessels, as well as interrupt operations. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, exploitation and acquisitions or result in loss of equipment and properties. Further our insurance may not adequately cover such events to reimburse us for the losses we may incur.\nDisruptions of services provided by marine service providers could temporarily impair our operations and delay delivery of our oil to be sold. We depend on marine service providers to support our offshore operations in the Block Z-1. These services include, among others, tender support barges for our drilling operations and tank vessels for oil storage and transportation. Any disruptions or delay of the services provided by our marine service providers because of adverse weather or sea conditions, accidents, mechanical failures, scheduling conflicts with other tankers at the Talara refinery, insufficient personnel or other events could temporarily impair our operations, delay implementation of our business plan and increase our costs.\nWe currently have one customer for our crude oil sales and any disruption to their operations could temporarily impair our operations and delay delivery of our oil to be sold. Our oil is delivered by vessel to the refinery owned by the Peruvian national oil company, Petroleos del Peru - PETROPERU S.A., in Talara, located approximately 70 miles south of the CX-11 platform. Produced oil is kept in production inventory until inventory quantities are at a sufficient level to make a delivery to the refinery in Talara. Although all of our oil sales are to Petroperu, we believe that the loss of Petroperu as our sole customer would not materially impact our business because we could readily find other purchasers for our oil production both in Peru and throughout the world. However this could take time and effort to re-market this crude oil and there can be no guarantee that we will be successful at this effort. Should we not be successful it would impact our cash flows related to oil sales.\nWe are assessing additional joint venture or partner relationships in our other blocks and our power generation project which subjects us to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our operations, our financial position and our results of operations. We may enter into additional joint venture arrangements in the future for Block Z-1 or our other blocks and our power generation project. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, including technical and operational as well as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these obligations, including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, is outside our direct control. If these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, our business may be adversely affected. Any joint venture arrangements we may enter into may involve risks not otherwise present when exploring and developing properties directly, including, for example:\n\u25cf\nour joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;\n\u25cf\nour joint venture partners may not pay their share of the joint venture\u2019s obligations, leaving us liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;\n\u25cf\nwe may incur liabilities as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners;\n\u25cf\nour joint venture partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, our interests or goals;\n\u25cf\nour joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives; and\n\u25cf\ndisputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.\nThe risks described above or the failure to continue our joint venture or to resolve disagreements with our joint venture partner could adversely affect our ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture and increase our expenses, which would in turn negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Geographic Location and Concentration.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms of certain contracts related to our foreign operations, we could lose our rights under each of those contracts. The terms of each of our Peruvian oil and gas license contracts require that we perform certain minimum work programs in each period under the contracts, such as seismic acquisition, processing and interpretations and the drilling of required wells in accordance with those contracts and agreements. We are also required to conduct environmental impact studies and environmental impact assessments and establish our ability to comply with environmental regulations. Our Peruvian operating subsidiary that holds the license contracts has posted guaranties as required in favor of Perupetro to insure performance for the minimum work program for the applicable period under the license contracts, generally in the amount of fifty percent of the estimated value of the minimum work program for the period. BPZ Resources, Inc. has also issued a parent company guaranty as required in favor of Perupetro providing for joint and several liability to Perupetro with respect to fulfillment of such minimum work programs for the applicable periods. If we (i) fail to timely perform those activities as required, (ii) we fail to maintain valid subsidiary or parent guaranties in favor of Perupetro and do not replace the guaranty within the time allowed under the license contract or (iii) there has been a declaration of insolvency, dissolution, liquidation or bankruptcy has been pronounced of the entity that granted the guaranty and we have not provided notice to Perupetro following receipt of Perupetro\u2019s request for a replacement guaranty, identifying the company that will assume such guaranty, once qualified and accepted by Perupetro, then our current production and sale of oil could be suspended, we could lose our rights under a particular contract and/or lose the amounts we have posted as a guaranty for the performance of such activities, which would result in a significant loss to us.\nThe geographic concentration of our properties in northwest Peru and southwest Ecuador subjects us to an increased risk of loss of revenue or curtailment of production from factors affecting that region specifically. The geographic concentration of our properties in northwest Peru and southwest Ecuador and adjacent waters means that some or all of our properties could be affected by the same event should that region, for example, experience:\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters such as earthquakes and/or severe weather (such as the effects of \u201cEl Ni\u00f1o,\u201d which can cause excessive rainfall and flooding in Peru and Ecuador);\n\u25cf\ndelays or decreases in production, the availability of equipment, facilities or services;\n\u25cf\ndelays or decreases in the availability of capacity to transport, gather or process production; or\n\u25cf\nchanges in the political or regulatory environment.\nBecause all our properties could experience the same conditions at the same time, these conditions could have a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other operators who have properties over a wider geographic area.\nOur operations in Peru and Ecuador involve substantial costs and are subject to certain risks because the oil and gas industry in Peru and Ecuador is less developed in comparison to the United States. Because the oil and gas industry in Peru and Ecuador is less developed than in the United States, our drilling and development operations, in many instances, will take longer to complete and may cost more than similar operations in the United States. The availability of technical expertise and specific equipment and supplies may be more limited or costly in Peru and Ecuador than in the United States. If we are unable to obtain, or unable to obtain without undue cost, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel, our exploitation and exploration operations could be delayed or adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, once oil and natural gas production is recovered, there are fewer ways to transport it to market for sale. Marine transportation for our offshore operations is subject to risks such as adverse weather conditions, collisions, groundings and other risks of damage or delay. Pipeline and trucking operations are subject to uncertainty and lack of availability. Oil and natural gas pipelines and truck transport travel through miles of territory and are subject to the risk of diversion, destruction or delay. We expect that such factors will continue to subject our international operations to economic and operating risks that companies with domestic operations do not experience.\nAlong with the general instability that comes from international operations, we face political and geographical risks specific to working in South America. All of our oil and gas properties are located in South America, and specifically in Peru and Ecuador. The success and profitability of our international operations may be adversely affected by risks associated with international activities, including among others:\n\u25cf\neconomic, labor, and social conditions;\n\u25cf\nlocal and regional political instability;\n\u25cf\ntax laws (including host-country export, excise and income taxes and U.S. taxes on foreign operations); and\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currencies in which oil and gas producing activities may be conducted.\nLegal uncertainty, operating expenses and fluctuations in exchange rates may make our assumptions about the economic viability of our oil and gas properties incorrect. If these assumptions are incorrect, we may not be able to earn sufficient revenue to cover our costs of operations.\nSocial and political unrest in Peru and Peruvian election results could cause heightened scrutiny over oil and gas regulatory matters. Peru\u2019s next Presidential election will be held in April 2016. The electoral campaigns could bring heightened attention to various topics, including the regulation of oil and gas companies operating in Peru, and related environmental law compliance. These elections and the result from the election could result in increased environmental regulation, including additional regulation and oversight of the hydrocarbon and mining sectors, and regulation to combat global climate change and decrease the emission of greenhouse gases. In addition, the elections could result in increased scrutiny of the royalties on oil and gas production, which could help fund domestic social-regeneration projects.\nWe are subject to numerous foreign laws and regulations of the oil and natural gas industry that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Our operations are subject to extensive foreign laws and regulations relating to the exploration for oil and natural gas and the development, production and transportation of oil and natural gas, as well as electrical power generation. Because the oil and gas industry in the countries in which we operate is less developed than elsewhere, changes in laws and interpretations of laws, including an interpretation that the oil period under the License Contract in Peru will not extend to the full 40 year period provided for gas operations, are more likely to occur than in countries with a more developed oil and gas industry. Future laws or regulations, as well as any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may harm our results of operations and financial condition. We may be required to make our share of contributions to large and unanticipated expenditures to comply with governmental regulations, such as:\n\u25cf\nwork program guarantees and other financial responsibility requirements;\n\u25cf\ntaxation;\n\u25cf\nroyalty requirements;\n\u25cf\ncustomer requirements;\n\u25cf\nemployee compensation and benefit costs;\n\u25cf\noperational reporting;\n\u25cf\nenvironmental and safety requirements; and\n\u25cf\nunitization requirements.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for our share of:\n\u25cf\npersonal injuries;\n\u25cf\nproperty and natural resource damages;\n\u25cf\nunexpected employee compensation and benefit costs;\n\u25cf\ngovernmental infringements and sanctions; and\n\u25cf\nunitization payments.\nCompliance with, or breach of, laws relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment can be costly and could limit our operations. As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties in Peru and Ecuador, we are subject to various national, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, (i) impose liability on the owner or lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up resulting from operations; (ii) subject the owner or lessee to liability for pollution damages and other environmental or natural resource damages; and (iii) require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. We have established practices for continued compliance with environmental laws and regulations and we believe the costs incurred by these policies and procedures so far have been necessary business costs in our industry. However, there is no assurance that changes in or additions to laws or regulations regarding the protection of the environment will not increase such compliance costs, or have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner and feasibility of our planned operations. The exploration for, and the development, production and sale of oil and gas in South America, and the construction and operation of power generation and gas processing facilities and pipelines in South America are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Our ability to conduct continued operations is subject to satisfying applicable regulatory and permitting controls. For example, we are required to obtain an environmental permit or approval from the government in Peru prior to conducting seismic operations, drilling a well or constructing a pipeline in Peruvian territory, including the waters offshore of Peru, where we intend to conduct future oil and gas operations. We are also required to comply with numerous environmental regulations in order to transition from exploration into production in any new fields we develop. Additionally, environmental laws and regulations promulgated in Peru impose substantial restrictions on, among other things, the use of natural resources, interference with the natural environment, the location of facilities, the handling and storage of hazardous materials such as hydrocarbons, the use of radioactive material, the disposal of waste, and the emission of noise and other activities. The laws create additional monitoring and reporting obligations in the event of any spillage or unregulated discharge of hazardous materials such as hydrocarbons. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our planned drilling operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties.\nOur current permits and authorizations and our ability to obtain future permits and authorizations may, over time, be susceptible to increased scrutiny, resulting in increased costs, or delays in receiving appropriate authorizations. In particular, we may experience delays in obtaining permits and authorizations in Peru necessary for our operations.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs of operations, as well as further restrict our foreign operations. Moreover, these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. These laws and regulations have changed in the past and have generally imposed more stringent requirements that increase operating costs or require capital expenditures in order to remain in compliance. It is also possible that unanticipated developments could cause us to make environmental expenditures that are significantly higher than those we currently anticipate, thereby increasing our overall costs. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could cause us to suspend or terminate certain operations or subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties. Any of these liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to implement our plan of operation.\nBPZ E&P is subject to labor and health and safety regulations and may be exposed to liabilities and potential costs for compliance. BPZ E&P is subject to Peruvian government and local labor and health and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the relationship between BPZ E&P and its employees and the health and safety of BPZ E&P\u2019s employees. For example, according to the Peruvian Safety and Health at Work Law (Ley de Seguridad y Salud en el Trabajo), Law No. 29783, BPZ E&P is required to adopt certain measures to safeguard the health and safety of its employees, as well as third parties, in its facilities. If compliance by BPZ E&P with such requirements should be reviewed by the applicable authorities and if an adverse final decision that BPZ E&P violated any labor laws, including the Peruvian Safety and Health at Work Law, should be issued in an administrative process, BPZ E&P may be exposed to penalties and sanctions, including the payment of fines and, depending on the level of severity of the infraction, exposed to the closure of its facilities and/or stoppage of its operations and the cancellation or suspension of governmental registrations, authorizations and licenses, any one of which may result in interruption or discontinuity of activities in BPZ E&P\u2019s facilities, and materially and adversely affect BPZ E&P.\nOur management team has limited experience in the power generation business. Our plan of operation includes constructing power generation and pipelines in Peru. However, the experience of our management team has primarily been in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry and we have limited experience in the power generation business. We have hired a Commercial Manager who has experience related to the power generation business. We continue relying on consultants and outside engineering and technical firms to provide the expertise to plan and execute the power generation aspects of our strategy and we have not yet hired all necessary full-time employees to manage this line of business. No assurance can be given that we will be able to recruit and hire qualified personnel on acceptable terms. Inability to hire such key technical personnel when necessary may adversely affect our gas-to-power project.\nConstruction and operation of power generation and pipelines involve significant risks and delays that cannot always be covered by insurance or contractual protections. The construction of power generation and pipelines involve many risks, including:\n\u25cf\nsupply interruptions;\n\u25cf\nwork stoppages;\n\u25cf\nlabor disputes;\n\u25cf\nsocial unrest;\n\u25cf\ninability to negotiate acceptable construction, supply or other contracts;\n\u25cf\ninability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals;\n\u25cf\nweather interferences;\n\u25cf\nunforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated cost overruns;\n\u25cf\npossible delays in the acquisition of support equipment necessary for our gas turbines;\n\u25cf\npossible delays in transporting the necessary equipment to our planned facility in Northern Peru;\n\u25cf\npossible delays in connection with power plant construction;\n\u25cf\npossible delays or difficulties in completing financing arrangements for the gas-to-power project; and\n\u25cf\npossible difficulties or delays with respect to any necessary Peruvian regulatory compliance.\nThe construction and future operation of these facilities involve all of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performances below expected levels of output or efficiency. We intend to maintain commercially reasonable levels of insurance, where such insurance is available and cost-effective, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels. However, the coverage or proceeds of any such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not be adequate to cover lost revenues or increased expenses. Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could result in lost revenues, increased expenses and higher costs.\nThe success of our gas-to-power project will depend, in part, on the existence and growth of markets for natural gas and electricity in Peru. Peru has a well-developed and stable market for electricity. Hydroelectric and gas-fired thermal power plants are the primary sources of electric generation, with each source providing approximately 50%. Hydroelectric plants are much less expensive to operate than plants that utilize natural gas, but they are subject to variable output based on rainfall and reservoir levels. Peru has natural gas reserves and production, but does not have a well-developed natural gas infrastructure, particularly in northwest Peru where we operate. Our immediate business plan relies on the continued stability of the power market in Peru. We currently do not expect to complete our power plant earlier than 2017. Further, we cannot guaranty that our efforts to complete the gas-to-power project will be successful. Our assessment of the future power market and demand in Peru and the near-term viability of the project could be inaccurate. We are subject to the following risks:\n\u25cf\nrelatively more favorable business conditions for hydroelectric plants, a material reduction in power demand or other competitive issues may adversely affect the demand and prices for the electricity that we expect to produce by the time the power plant is completed;\n\u25cf\nour lifting costs could exceed the minimum wholesale power prices available, making the sale of our gas uneconomical;\n\u25cf\ngas supply and reserves may not develop as anticipated;\n\u25cf\npotential disruptions or changes to the regulation of the natural gas or power markets in the region could occur by the time our power plant is completed, or we may not receive the necessary environmental or other permits and governmental approvals necessary to operate our power plant or to proceed with the plant in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\nalthough we plan to enter into long-term contracts to sell a significant part of our future power production, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such contracts or that they will be on favorable terms; and\n\u25cf\nwe will be subject to the general commercial issues related to being in the power business, including the credit-worthiness of, and collections from future customers and the ability to profitably operate our future power plant.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and our failure to comply with the laws and regulations thereunder could result in material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to the FCPA, and our failure to comply with the laws and regulations thereunder could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials to secure any improper advantage for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. Since all of our oil and gas properties are in Peru and Ecuador, there is a risk of potential FCPA violations. We have a FCPA policy and a compliance program designed to ensure that we, our employees and agents comply with the FCPA. There is no assurance that such policy or program will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we acquire. Any violation of these laws could result in monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.\nCompetition for oil and natural gas properties and prospects is intense; many of our competitors have larger financial, technical and personnel resources that give them an advantage in evaluating and obtaining properties and prospects. We operate in a highly competitive environment for reviewing prospects, acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel and equipment. In addition, changes in Peruvian government regulation have enabled multinational and regional companies to enter the Peruvian energy market. We compete with other companies in our industry when acquiring new leases or oil and gas properties. Competition in our business activities has increased and may increase further, as existing and new participants expand their activities as a result of these regulatory changes. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial resources that allow them to obtain substantially greater technical and personnel resources than we have. For example, if several companies are interested in an area, Perupetro may choose to call for bids, either through international competitive biddings or through private bidding processes by invitation, and award the contract to the highest bidder. These additional resources can be particularly important in reviewing prospects and purchasing properties. Our competitors may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial, technical or personnel resources permit. Our competitors may also be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay. On the acquisition opportunities made available to us, we may compete with other companies in our industry for properties operated by third parties through a private bidding process, direct negotiations or some combination thereof. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted. The availability of properties for acquisition depends largely on the business practices of other oil and natural gas companies, commodity prices, general economic conditions and other factors we cannot control or influence. Our size and current financial status may impair our ability to compete for oil and natural gas properties and prospects.\nOther Business Risks.\nWe are subject to routine and ongoing tax audits with the United States Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and tax authorities for other jurisdictions that could result in additional tax assessment. We have been subject to audits by the IRS and the tax and customs office in Peru (\u201cSUNAT\u201d). If the IRS or SUNAT disagrees with the positions taken by us on our tax returns, we could have additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. If our positions are not upheld through the appeal process and we ultimately pay such amounts, the payment could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.\nFailure to generate taxable income and realize our deferred tax assets in Peru could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The assessment of deferred tax assets and of valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets require management to make estimates and judgments about the realization of deferred tax assets, which realization will be primarily based on forecasts of future taxable income. Such estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain. We evaluate our deferred tax assets generated in Peru for realization annually or whenever there is an indication that they are not realizable. The ultimate realization of our foreign deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in Peru within the time periods required by applicable tax statutes. Should we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our foreign deferred tax assets will not be realized, we will be required to record a valuation allowance in connection with these deferred tax assets. Such valuation allowance, if taken, would be recorded as a charge to income tax expense and our financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected in the period such determination is made.\nInsurance does not cover all risks. Exploration for, and the production of, oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts, cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can result in (i) damage to or destruction of wells and/or production facilities, (ii) damage to or destruction of formations, (iii) injury to persons, (iv) loss of life, or (v) damage to property, the environment or natural resources. As a result, we presently maintain insurance coverage in amounts consistent with our business activities and to the extent required by our license contracts. Such insurance coverage includes certain physical damage to our and third parties\u2019 property, hull and machinery, protection and indemnity, employer\u2019s liability, comprehensive third party general liability, workers\u2019 compensation and certain pollution and environmental risks. However, we are not fully insured against all risks in all aspects of our business, such as political risk, civil unrest, war, business interruption, environmental damage and reservoir loss or damage. Further, no such insurance coverage can insure for all operational or environmental risks. The occurrence of an event that is not insured or not fully insured could result in losses to us. For example, uninsured or under insured environmental damages, property damages or damages related to personal injuries could divert capital needed to implement our plan of operation. If any such uninsured losses are significant, we may have to curtail or suspend our drilling or other operations until such time as replacement capital is obtained, if ever, and this could have a material adverse impact on our financial position.\nThe loss of senior management or key technical personnel could adversely affect us. We have engaged certain members of management who have substantial expertise in the type of endeavors we presently conduct and the geographical areas in which we conduct them. We do not maintain any life insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. To the extent their services become unavailable, we will be required to retain other qualified personnel. There can be no assurance we will be able to recruit and hire qualified persons on acceptable terms. Similarly, the oil and gas exploration industry requires the use of personnel with substantial technical expertise. In the event that the services of our current technical personnel become unavailable, we will need to hire qualified personnel to take their place. No assurance can be given that we will be able to recruit and hire such persons on acceptable terms. Inability to replace lost members of management or key technical personnel may adversely affect us.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss. Businesses have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial of service on websites.\nThe oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and for compliance reporting. The use of mobile communication devices has also increased rapidly. The complexity of the technologies needed to extract oil and gas in increasingly difficult physical environments, such as deep water, and global competition for oil and gas resources make certain information more attractive to thieves.\nWe depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves and for many other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology.\nOur technologies, systems and networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nA cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others:\n\u25cf\nunauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, operational results or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our competitive position in developing our oil and gas resources;\n\u25cf\ndata corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in a dry hole cost or even drilling incidents;\n\u25cf\ndata corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production or accidental discharge;\n\u25cf\na cyber-attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt one of our major projects, effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project;\n\u25cf\na cyber-attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u25cf\na cyber-attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;\n\u25cf\na deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u25cf\nsignificant business interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation, or a negative impact on the price of our common stock.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber incidents, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Securities.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile. The market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. The market price and trading volume of our stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this section of the Form 10-K, as well as other factors including:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf\nour voluntary filing under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code;\n\u25cf\nour delisting from the NYSE;\n\u25cf\nfailure to be covered by securities analysts, or failure by us to meet securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u25cf\nsuccess of our operating strategies;\n\u25cf\ndecline in the stock price of companies that are our peers;\n\u25cf\nrealization of any of the risks described in this section; or\n\u25cf\ngeneral market and economic conditions.\nFrom January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the closing price of our common stock as reported on the NYSE ranged from a high of $3.40 to a low of $0.17. As a result of this volatility and our recent filing under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, an investment in our stock is subject to substantial risk. A plan of reorganization may result in holders of our capital stock receiving very limited or no distribution on account of their interests and cancellation of their existing stock. Furthermore, the volatility of our stock price could negatively impact our ability to raise capital in the future.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced in the past, and may in the future experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nOur shares are subject to risks associated with trading in an over-the- counter market. On March 2, 2015, we were notified by the NYSE that the staff of NYSE Regulation, Inc. had determined to commence proceedings to delist our common stock from the NYSE. Trading of our common stock on the NYSE was suspended immediately and currently only trades in the over-the-counter market. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market generally have significantly less liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange, through factors such as a reduction in the number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the number of market makers in the securities, reduction in securities analyst and news media coverage and lower market prices than might otherwise be obtained. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all. Furthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur, the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors or parties with whom we have business relationships. With respect to the Company, in some cases, we may be subject to additional compliance requirements under applicable state laws in the issuance of our securities. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future. In addition, we may experience other adverse effects, including, without limitation, the loss of confidence in us by current and prospective suppliers, customers, employees and others with whom we have or may seek to initiate business relationships.\nInvestor profits, if any, may be limited for the foreseeable future. In the past, we have never paid a dividend. Further we have voluntarily filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and common shareholders may receive very limited, if any amount on their investment in the event a plan of reorganization is approved by the Bankruptcy Court as such plan may not assign any equity interest to prior shareholders. We do not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future following our reorganization. Accordingly, investors in our common stock may not derive any profits from their investment in us for the foreseeable future, other than through any price appreciation of our common stock that may occur. Further, any appreciation in the price of our common stock may be limited or nonexistent, or in fact it could decline, as long as we continue to have operating losses and are subject to the Bankruptcy Court proceedings. We have not been profitable and have accumulated a deficit of operations totaling $539.5 million through December 31, 2014. To date we have had limited revenue and no earnings from operations. There can be no assurances that sufficient revenue to cover total expenses can be achieved until, if at all, we can complete our reorganization and fully implement our operational plan. Accordingly we urge extreme caution in making an investment decision with respect to our securities.\nAdditional infusions of capital may have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders. We have voluntarily filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and common shareholders may receive very limited, if any amount on their investment in the event a plan of reorganization is approved by the Bankruptcy Court as such plan may not assign any equity interest to prior shareholders. Any financing received through the Chapter 11 proceedings will be senior in priority to all of our other debt and equity.\nOur certificate of formation does not provide for preemptive rights, although by contract we have granted the International Finance Corporation (\u201cIFC\u201d) the right to purchase shares of our common stock to retain its proportionate ownership pursuant to the Subscription Agreement dated December 16, 2006 by and between IFC and us. Any future additional equity financing that we receive may involve substantial dilution to our then-existing shareholders. In addition, we are authorized to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, the rights and preferences of which may be designated by our Board of Directors. If we issue shares of preferred stock, such preferred stock may have rights and preferences that are superior to those of our common stock.\nOur corporate organizational documents and the provisions of Texas law to which we are subject may delay or prevent a change in control of us that some shareholders may favor. Our certificate of formation and bylaws contain provisions that, either alone or in combination with the provisions of Texas law described below, may have the effect of delaying or making it more difficult for another person to acquire us by means of a hostile tender offer, open market purchases, a proxy contest or otherwise. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\nA board of directors classified into three classes of directors with each class having staggered, three-year terms. As a result of this provision, at least two annual meetings of shareholders may be required for the shareholders to change a majority of our board of directors.\n\u25cf\nThe board\u2019s authority to issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval, which preferred stock could have voting, liquidation, dividend or other rights superior to those of our common stock. To the extent any such provisions are included in any preferred stock, they could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control.\n\u25cf\nOur shareholders cannot act by less than unanimous written consent and must comply with the provisions of our bylaws requiring advance notification of shareholder nominations and proposals. These provisions could have the effect of delaying or impeding a proxy contest for control of us.\n\u25cf\nProvisions of Texas law, which we did not opt out of in our certificate of formation, that restrict business combinations with \u201caffiliated shareholders\u201d and provide that directors serving on staggered boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.\nAny or all of these provisions could discourage tender offers or other business combination transactions that might otherwise result in our shareholders receiving a premium over the then current market price of our common stock. Further we have voluntarily filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and there may be a change in control on the execution of an agreed upon plan of reorganization through the Bankruptcy Court proceeding.\nOur officers, directors, entities affiliated with them and certain institutional investors may exercise significant control over us. In the aggregate, our management and directors own or control approximately 6.5% of our common stock, and several institutional investors own approximately another 22.2% of our common stock, issued as of December 31, 2014. These shareholders own in total approximately 28.7%, and, if acting together, would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. However we have voluntarily filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and the ability of our officers, directors and institutional investors to exercise significant control over us may be significantly diminished or removed entirely through the Bankruptcy Court proceeding.", "PERMNO": 84553, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "BPZRQ"}
