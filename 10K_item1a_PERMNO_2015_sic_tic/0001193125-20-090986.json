{"cik": "895665", "company": "SUPERCONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following section includes some of the material factors that may adversely affect our business and operations. This is not an exhaustive list, and additional factors could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. This discussion of risk factors includes many forward-looking statements. For cautions about relying on such forward looking statements, please refer to the section entitled \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Report immediately prior to Item 1.\nWe have included disclosures throughout this Report, including Risk Factors, that relate to our business as it was conducted prior to the planned Merger and asset disposition described above. Readers are cautioned that both historical and forward looking disclosures, as well as Risk Factors, regarding our business must be read in conjunction with the information regarding the planned Merger and asset dispositions, because some disclosures regarding historical operations may not be indicative of future or current operations and plans. In particular, but without limitation, the reference to our historical business operations regarding our HTS wire should not be viewed as a statement that such operations continue to this day. Please see \u201cOur Future Business\u201d for additional important information.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and may never become profitable.\nIn each of our last five years, we have experienced significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. In 2019, we incurred a net loss of $9.2 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $8.8 million. In 2018, we incurred a net loss of $8.1 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $6.9 million. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included in its audit reports an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Unless we can successfully implement our strategic alternatives plan including, among others, a business combination such as our merger with Clearday, or a sale of STI, we will need to raise additional capital during this fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 to maintain our viability.\nWe may need to raise additional capital or complete a strategic alternative for the company. If we are unable to raise capital, our ability to implement our strategic plan and ultimately our viability as a company could be adversely affected.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $0.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our current forecast is that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the first quarter of 2020. Our cash resources will not be sufficient to fund our business through the end of the current fiscal year. Therefore we will need to raise additional capital during this fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 to maintain the viability of the Company.\nWe entered a Merger Agreement and consummated various asset sales that fundamentally change our risk profile.\nOn February 26, 2020 we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Allied Integral United, Inc. (\u201cClearday\u201d), a privately-held company dedicated to delivering next generation longevity care and wellness services, whereby a wholly-owned subsidiary of STI will merge with and into Clearday in a stock-for-stock transaction with Clearday. Upon completion of the merger, STI will change its name to Clearday, Inc. The merged company will focus on the development of Clearday\u2019s non-residential daily care service model as well as\nthe continued operation of Clearday\u2019s existing Memory Care America residential memory care facilities. As part of plans to develop and expand its assortment of innovative, non-residential daily care services, Clearday intends to leverage STI\u2019s existing Cryogenic Cooler as an enabling technology for one of its service offerings in the home healthcare market.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement by each of STI and Clearday stockholders, (ii) Nasdaq approval of continued listing of STI Common Stock under its applicable rules, including the rules applicable to its change of control listing application, (iii) the Registration Statement being declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and (iv) the STI officers with severance rights entering Waiver Agreements. Each party\u2019s obligation to complete the Merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (i) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, performance by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement, (iii) the absence of any Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on the other party and (iv) the absence of any law, order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the Merger or making the completion of the Merger illegal. In addition, it is a condition to closing that STI\u2019s adjusted net working capital computed in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement be not less than negative $250,000 as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that all directors of STI, other than Jeffrey Quiram, STI\u2019s current Chief Executive Officer, shall have resigned from the Board of Directors of STI; Mr. Quiram is expected to remain a member of the Board of Directors.\nThe Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties. The representations, warranties and covenants of each party set forth in the Merger Agreement have been made only for the purposes of, and were and are solely for the benefit of the parties to, the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Accordingly, the representations and warranties may not describe the actual state of affairs at the date they were made or at any other time, and investors should not rely on them as statements of fact. In addition, such representations and warranties (i) will not survive consummation of the Merger and (ii) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date as is specified in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the parties\u2019 public disclosures. Accordingly, the Merger Agreement is included with this filing only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement, and not to provide investors with any factual information regarding STI or Clearday, their respective affiliates or their respective businesses. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the STI, Clearday, their respective affiliates or their respective businesses, the Merger Agreement and the Merger that will be contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the S-4 Registration Statement, as well as this report, and Forms 10-Q and other filings that STI makes with the SEC.\nSubsequent to the announcement on January 28, 2020 about our cost reduction plan, we started the process of selling, in separate transactions, assets that we deemed non-essential going forward. The latest such transaction entered into on March 5th, when considered in combination with the prior transactions since January 28, 2020, may be deemed a material definitive purchase agreement for sales of various production, R&D, and testing equipment and selected intellectual property related primarily to our superconducting wire initiative. The aggregate sales prices of the post January 28th transactions is expected to be approximately $1,075,000, all sold to purchasers having no affiliation with us. When the transactions are completed over the next several weeks, we will continue to hold production, R&D, and testing assets for our Sapphire cryocooler business, along with the majority of our intellectual property assets. The proceeds from this series of transactions is expected to be sufficient, together with the our other capital resources, for us to complete the Merger.\nAs a result of these sales, we no longer have the ability to resume HTS wire operations without significant new investments and restructured operations and a new HTS wire business plan, neither of which we currently intend to pursue, as we instead focus our efforts on completing the Merger.\nAs of the date of this Report, the Nasdaq Hearing Panel has not ruled on our request to obtain additional time in which to cure our listing deficiencies. There is no assurance as to when or how the Nasdaq Hearing Panel will rule, or whether, even if a ruling is to provide us additional time, the amount of time will be sufficient. In addition, there is no assurance that the SEC will declare our planned Form S-4 effective at all or in a timely manner, nor is there any assurance that the various conditions to the Merger Agreement will be satisfied at all or in a timely manner. In particular, there is no assurance that the financial statements required of Clearday will be provided in a timely manner or that they will be reasonably satisfactory to us.\nThere is no certainty that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger is not completed our securities may become delisted from Nasdaq and quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTC Pink Sheet Market, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange. In that case, the liquidity and price of our securities is likely to be significantly more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nEven if the Merger is completed, there is no certainty regarding the performance of the combined company. Clearday is a private company with limited financial data. Any financial data of Clearday will only be available to stockholders upon the filing of the registration statement on Form S-4. Completion of the Merger would highly dilute the shares of existing STI stockholders, who, together with STI warrant holders, are collectively expected to own less than 5% of the combined company.\nAdditionally, the price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction to the Merger and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities may never develop following the Merger or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities following the Merger may vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports\nWe have not yet received sufficient financial information from Clearday in order for us to request or receive a fairness opinion and we reserve the right to terminate the Merger Agreement (among other reasons) if such information is untimely or inadequate.\nAs of the date of this Report, due to delays in obtaining Clearday financial information, as disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 3, 2020, our Board of Directors still retains the right to terminate the Merger Agreement at no cost to us if certain material financial information regarding Clearday is not timely delivered or is not reasonably acceptable to us or if the firm we retained to provide a fairness opinion to us declines to render such opinion on account of Clearday\u2019s financial information. Although we have received valuation information that our Board of Directors deemed sufficient in order to enter into the Merger Agreement, we have not yet received a fairness opinion and do not intend to request one until sufficient financial information to support a fairness opinion is provided to us. While our Board of Directors believes that the Merger Agreement is in the best interests of our stockholders, stockholders or prospective stockholders should understand these limitations in the information that our Board of Directors has, to date, received. We intend, but are not obligated, to inform our stockholders and the market when and if our Board of Directors has received the above-mentioned Clearday financial information and, if available, affirmative fairness opinion.\nThere are numerous technological challenges that must be overcome in order for our Conductus wire to become commercially successful and our ability to address such technological challenges may adversely affect our ability to gain customers.\nOur plan, prior to our announcements discussed in \u201cOur Future Business\u201d, was for commercial production of Conductus wire following completion of qualification orders. We have experienced in the past, and may\ncontinue to experience, delays in achieving commercial production of Conductus. Commercialization can be delayed, among other factors, by technological challenges as we seek to improve our products and processes, delays from customer qualification orders and customer analysis of those orders, and decisions made by our customers with respect to post-qualification orders. Many of the factors that affect successful commercialization of our products are affected by third party decisions.\nConductus wire was uniquely positioned to address three key technical challenges in the market: high performance, improved economics and commercial-scale capacity. To date, we, along with existing HTS wire manufacturers, have not overcome these challenges to allow for broad commercialization of HTS wire. Customers cannot purchase long-length wire with any reasonable confidence or guaranteed volume; and electric utilities lack confidence in product availability which leads to delays in their deployment roadmap. HTS wire performance is currently below what many customers require. Many power applications require high performance wire with high current carrying capacity, mechanical durability, electrical integrity with low AC losses and minimal splices. Producing high performance HTS wire has proven difficult, especially at volumes required for large scale deployment. The high demand for high performance wire available in very low volume results in a high wire price that narrows the market and limits commercial viability.\nWe have made significant progress in these areas, however delays in our Conductus wire development, as a result of technological challenges or other factors, may result in the introduction or commercial acceptance of our Conductus wire products later than expected.\nThe commercial uses of superconducting wire and superconducting wire related products are limited today, and a broad commercial market may not develop.\nEven if the technological hurdles are overcome, there is no certainty that a robust commercial market for unproven HTS wire products will come to fruition. To date, commercial use of HTS wire has been limited to small feasibility demonstrations, and these projects are largely subsidized by government authorities. While customer demand is high and market forecasts project large revenue opportunity for superconducting wire in power applications, the market may not develop and superconducting wire might never achieve long term, broad commercialization. In such an event, we would not be able to commercialize our Conductus wire initiative and our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling superconducting wire products, and our failure to effectively market and sell our superconducting wire solutions would lower our revenue and cash flow.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling our Conductus wire. Once our Conductus wire is ready for commercial use, we will have to hire and develop a marketing and sales team to effectively demonstrate the advantages of our product over both more traditional products and competing superconducting products or other adjacent technologies. We may not be successful in our efforts to market this new technology.\nWe expect continued customer pressures to reduce our product pricing which may adversely affect our ability to operate on a commercially viable basis.\nWe expect to face pressure to reduce prices and accordingly, the average selling price of our Conductus wire. We anticipate customer pressure on our product pricing will continue for the foreseeable future. HTS wire is currently being sold at $250/kiloampere-meter (kA-m). At this price, HTS wire represents a significant cost of the end device. A price reduction is required for long term commercialization. Cryogenic systems, including cryocoolers and cryostats, have been developed but will also need to be cost optimized as HTS wire becomes available in volume. We have plans to further reduce the manufacturing cost of our products, but there is no assurance that our future cost reduction efforts will keep pace with price erosion. We will need to further reduce our manufacturing costs through engineering improvements and economies of scale in production and purchasing in order to achieve adequate gross margins. We may not be able to achieve the required product cost savings at a\nrate needed to keep pace with competitive pricing pressure. Additionally, we may be forced to discount future orders or may never reach commercial viability. If we fail to reach our cost saving objectives or we are required to offer future discounts, our business may be harmed.\nWe face competition with respect to various aspects of our technology and product development.\nOur former wireless products compete on the basis of performance, functionality, reliability, pricing, quality, and compliance with industry standards. With respect to our Conductus wire materials, our competition includes American Superconductor (AMSC), SuperPower (Furukawa), SuNam , Bruker, Shanghai Superconductor, BASF, SuperOx, Fujikura, Sumitomo, THEVA, Showa Cable Systems (SWCC), and Suzhou Advanced Materials Research Institute (SAMRI). In addition, we previously supplied components and license technology to several companies that may eventually decide to manufacture or design their own HTS components, rather than purchasing or licensing our technology. If we are unable to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, then our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively against alternative technologies.\nOur products also compete with a number of alternative approaches and technologies. Some of these alternatives may be more cost effective or offer better performance than our products and we may not succeed in competing against these alternatives.\nWe currently rely on specific technologies and may not successfully adapt to the rapidly changing market environments.\nWe must overcome technical challenges to commercialize our Conductus wire. If we are able to do so, we will need to attain customer acceptance of our Conductus wire, and we cannot ensure that such acceptance will occur. We will have to continue to develop and integrate advances to our core technologies. We will also need to continue to develop and integrate advances in complementary technologies. We cannot guarantee that our development efforts will not be rendered obsolete by research efforts and technological advances made by others. Our business success depends upon our ability to keep pace with advancing technology, including materials, processes and industry standards.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe lack of any contractual obligation by our customers to purchase their forecasted demand for our products;\n\u2022\nvariations in the timing, cancellation, or rescheduling of customer orders, shipments and government contracts; and\n\u2022\nhigh fixed expenses that may disproportionately impact operating expenses, especially during a quarter with a sales shortfall.\nIf our customers desire to purchase products in excess of the forecasted amounts or in a different product mix, there may not be enough inventory or manufacturing capacity to fill their orders. Customer backlog may not be converted in to commercial revenues.\nDue to these and other factors, our past results have limited predictive value as to our Conductus wire initiative or government contract revenues. Future revenues and operating results may not meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors. In either case, the price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nAny outbreak of contagious diseases, or other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, or other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. For example, the coronavirus may impact the global economy or negatively affect various aspects of our business, including demand for our products and services. The extent to which the coronavirus may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus. A health epidemic or other outbreak could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWorldwide economic uncertainty may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe United States and global economies continue to experience a period of economic and financial uncertainty, which could result in economic volatility having direct and indirect adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition in a number of ways. For example, current or potential customers may delay or decrease spending with us, may delay paying us for previously purchased products, or may not pay us at all. In addition, this recent downturn has had, and may continue to have, an unprecedented negative impact on the global credit markets. If we are required to obtain financing in the near term to meet our working capital or other business needs, we may not be able to obtain that financing. Further, even if we are able to obtain the financing we need, it may be on terms that are not favorable to us, with increased financing costs and restrictive covenants.\nOur reliance on a limited number of suppliers and the long lead time of components for our products could impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our systems on a timely basis.\nA number of components used in our products are available from a limited number of outside suppliers due to unique designs as well as certain quality and performance requirements. Our reliance on sole or limited source suppliers involves certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These include the possibility of a shortage or the discontinuation of certain key components. Any reduced availability of these parts or components when required could impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our systems on a timely basis and result in the delay or cancellation of orders, which could harm our business.\nIn addition, the purchase of some of our key components involves long lead times and, in the event of unanticipated increases in demand for our solutions, we may be unable to obtain these components in sufficient quantities to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. We do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with any of these suppliers, do not maintain an extensive inventory of parts or components and customarily purchase sole or limited source parts and components pursuant to purchase orders. Business disruptions, quality issues, production shortfalls or financial difficulties of a sole or limited source supplier could materially and adversely affect us by increasing product costs, or eliminating or delaying the availability of such parts or components. In such events, our inability to develop alternative sources of supply quickly and on a cost-effective basis could impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our systems on a timely basis and could harm our business.\nOur reliance on a limited number of suppliers exposes us to quality control issues.\nOur reliance on certain single-source and limited-source components exposes us to quality control issues if these suppliers experience a failure in their production process or otherwise fail to meet our quality requirements.\nA failure in single-source or limited-source components or products could force us to repair or replace a product utilizing replacement components. If we cannot obtain comparable replacements or effectively return or redesign our products, we could lose customer orders or incur additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and results of operations.\nOur ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain, exposing us to possible losses of competitive advantage.\nOur efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not succeed in preventing infringement by others or ensure that these rights will provide us with a competitive advantage. Pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and the validity of issued patents may be subject to challenge. Third parties may also be able to design around the patented aspects of the products. Additionally, certain of the issued patents and patent applications are owned jointly with third parties. Because any owner or co-owner of a patent can license its rights under jointly-owned patents or applications, inventions made by us jointly with others are not subject to our exclusive control. Any of these possible events could result in losses of competitive advantage.\nWe depend on specific patents and licenses to technologies, and we will likely need additional technologies in the future that we may not be able to obtain.\nWe utilize technologies under licenses of patents from others for our products. These patents may be subject to challenge, which may result in significant litigation expense (which may or may not be recoverable against future royalty obligations). Additionally, we continually try to develop new products, and, in the course of doing so, we may be required to utilize intellectual property rights owned by others and may seek licenses to do so. Such licenses may not be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. It is also possible that we may inadvertently utilize intellectual property rights held by others, which could result in substantial claims.\nIntellectual property infringement claims against us could materially harm results of operations.\nOur products incorporate a number of technologies, including high-temperature superconductor technology, technology related to other materials, and electronics technologies. Our patent positions, and that of other companies using high-temperature superconductor technology, is uncertain and there is significant risk that others, including our competitors or potential competitors, have obtained or will obtain patents relating to our products or technologies or products or technologies planned to be introduced by us.\nWe believe that patents may be or have been issued, or applications may be pending, claiming various compositions of matter used in our products. We may need to secure one or more licenses of these patents. There can be no assurances that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may be required to expend significant resources to develop alternatives that would not infringe such patents or to obtain licenses to the related technology. We may not be able to successfully design around these patents or obtain licenses to them and may have to defend ourselves at substantial cost against allegations of infringement of third party patents or other rights to intellectual property. In those circumstances, we could face significant liabilities and also be forced to cease the use of key technology.\nOther parties may have the right to utilize technology important to our business.\nWe utilize certain intellectual property rights under non-exclusive licenses or have granted to others the right to utilize certain intellectual property rights licensed from a third party. Because we may not have the exclusive rights to utilize such intellectual property, other parties may be able to compete with us, which may harm our business.\nBecause competition for target employees is intense, we may be subject to claims of unfair hiring practices, trade secret misappropriation or other related claims.\nCompanies in HTS wire industries whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices, trade secret misappropriation or other related claims. We may be subject to such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel, and such claims may result in material litigation. If this should occur, we could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims, regardless of their merits.\nOur success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and technical personnel with relevant expertise.\nAs a competitor in a highly technical market, we depend heavily upon the efforts of our existing senior management and technical teams. The loss of the services of one or more members of these teams could slow product development and commercialization objectives. Due to the specialized nature of our products, we also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical personnel with substantial industry knowledge and expertise. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nRegulatory changes could substantially harm our business.\nCertain regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries set standards for operations within their territories. HTS wire is subject to a regulatory regime, which may become more strictly regulated if the market grows. Any failure or delay in obtaining necessary approvals could harm our business.\nWe may acquire or make investments in companies or technologies that could cause loss of value to stockholders and disruption of business.\nWe may explore opportunities to acquire companies or technologies in the future. Other than the acquisition of Conductus, Inc. in 2002, we have not made any such acquisitions or investments to date and, therefore, our ability as an organization to make acquisitions or investments is unproven. An acquisition entails many risks, any of which could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to integrate operations, services and personnel;\n\u2022\nthe price paid may exceed the value eventually realized;\n\u2022\nloss of share value to existing stockholders as a result of issuing equity securities to finance an acquisition;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees from either our then current business or any acquired business;\n\u2022\nentering into markets in which we have little or no prior experience;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial resources and management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nassumption of unanticipated liabilities related to the acquired assets; and\n\u2022\nthe business or technologies acquired or invested in may have limited operating histories and may be subject to many of the same risks to which we are exposed.\nIn addition, future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets, any of which could harm our business. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed.\nIf we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our potential growth, we may not be able to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan.\nOur ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process. Growth in future operations would place a significant strain on management systems and resources. We expect that we would need to improve our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures, and would need to expand, train and manage our work force worldwide. Furthermore, we expect that we would be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers and other third parties.\nCompliance with environmental regulations could be especially costly due to the hazardous materials used in the manufacturing process. In addition, we could incur expenditures related to hazardous material accidents.\nWe are subject to a number of federal, state and local governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our business. Current or future laws and regulations could require substantial expenditures for preventative or remedial action, reduction of chemical exposure, waste treatment or disposal. Any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines, suspension of production or interruption of operations. In addition, these regulations could restrict our ability to expand or could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expense to comply with environmental regulations or to clean up prior discharges.\nIn addition, although we believe that our safety procedures for the handling and disposing of hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, there is always the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. To date, we have not incurred substantial expenditures for preventive action with respect to hazardous materials or for remedial action with respect to any hazardous materials accident, but the use and disposal of hazardous materials involves risk that we could incur substantial expenditures for such preventive or remedial actions. If such an accident were to occur, we could be held liable for resulting damages. The liability in the event of an accident or the costs of such remedial actions could exceed our resources or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe reliability of market data included in our public filings is uncertain.\nSince we operate in a rapidly changing market, we have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, include market data from industry publications and our own internal estimates in some of the documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The reliability of this data cannot be assured. Industry publications generally state that the information contained in these publications has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that its accuracy and completeness is not guaranteed. Although we believe that the market data used in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission is and will be reliable, it has not been independently verified. Similarly, internal company estimates, while believed by us to be reliable, have not been verified by any independent sources.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is expected to be, subject to significant volatility. The value of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance or prospects. Factors affecting our market price include:\n\u2022\nmarket perception as to the Merger and the information provided about Clearday when and if it becomes available, including the risks related to the Clearday business;\n\u2022\nour perceived prospects and liquidity;\n\u2022\nprogress or any lack of progress (or perceptions related to progress) in timely overcoming the remaining substantial technical and commercial challenges related to our Conductus wire initiative;\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results and whether we have achieved key business targets;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or our failure to meet, earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 buy/sell recommendations;\n\u2022\ndifferences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new contracts by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarket reaction to any acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, political or stock market conditions.\nRecent events have caused stock prices for many companies, including ours, to fluctuate in ways unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance. The general economic, political and stock market conditions that may affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control. The market price of our common stock at any particular time may not remain the market price in the future.\nIf we fail to maintain the listing of our common stock with a U.S. national securities exchange, the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market or if we are unable to transfer our listing to another stock market.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq has adopted a number of continued listing standards that are applicable to our common stock, including a requirement that the bid price of our common stock be at least $1.00 per share. Failure to maintain the minimum bid price can result in the delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOn July 9, 2019, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market notifying us that the minimum bid price per share for our common stock fell below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days and that therefore we did not meet the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d). The letter also states that we will be provided 180 calendar days, or until January 6, 2020, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, which we were unable to do.\nOn December 2, 2019, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that we also did not meet the minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders\u2019 equity required by Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) for continued listing (the \u201cStockholders\u2019 Equity Requirement), which we also were unable to remedy.\nOn January 7, 2020, we received a letter (the \u201cNasdaq Letter\u201d) from the Staff notifying us that we had not regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cBid Price Requirement) by January 6, 2020, the 180 calendar day period previously provided in the letter received from the Staff on July 9, 2019 to regain compliance. The letter also confirmed that we are not eligible for a second 180 day period to regain compliance due to us not satisfying the Stockholders\u2019 Equity Requirement.\nOn January 13, 2020, we submitted a written request for a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d) to appeal the determination of the staff of the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department (the \u201cStaff\u201d) relating to the previously disclosed Nasdaq Letter. The hearing before the Panel was on February 27, 2020 and no decision has been received yet. The hearing request will stay any delisting action by Nasdaq of our common stock at least until the Panel renders a decision in this matter. At the hearing, we outlined our plan to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement and the Stockholders\u2019 Equity Requirement. There can be no assurance that the Panel will accept our compliance plan. Our plan of compliance is to complete the Merger with Clearday, and regain compliance based upon the combined company\u2019s financial condition and operations and governance. The Merger will take time to complete, and the Nasdaq Hearing Panel may not, under Nasdaq\u2019s rules, grant us beyond July 6, 2020, if they decide to grant us any time at all, in their discretion.\nAs of the date of this Report, the Nasdaq Hearing Panel has not ruled on our request to obtain additional time in which to cure our listing deficiencies. There is no assurance as to when or how the Nasdaq Hearing Panel\nwill rule, or whether, even if a ruling is to provide us additional time, the amount of time will be sufficient. In addition, there is no assurance that the SEC will declare our planned Form S-4 effective at all or in a timely manner, nor is there any assurance that the various conditions to the Merger Agreement will be satisfied at all or in a timely manner. In particular, there is no assurance that the financial statements required of Clearday will be provided in a timely manner or that they will be reasonably satisfactory to us.\nIf our common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board, OTC QB or another over-the-counter market. Any such alternative would likely result in it being more difficult for us to raise additional capital through the public or private sale of equity securities and for investors to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our common stock. In addition, there can be no assurance that our common stock would be eligible for trading on any such alternative exchange or markets.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants and options, and future sales of the shares obtained upon exercise of these options or warrants could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 137,256 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $25.20 per share and warrants to purchase up to 16,181,232 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.60 per share. The holders may sell these shares in the public markets from time to time under a registration statement or under Rule 144, without limitations on the timing, amount or method of sale. As our stock price rises, the holders may exercise their warrants and options and sell a large number of shares. This could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur corporate governance structure may prevent our acquisition by another company at a premium over the public trading price of our shares.\nIt is possible that the acquisition of a majority of our outstanding voting stock by another company could result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the public trading price for our shares. Provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, each as amended, and of Delaware corporate law could delay or make more difficult an acquisition of our company by merger, tender offer or proxy contest, even if it would create an immediate benefit to our stockholders. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation does not permit stockholders to act by written consent, and our bylaws generally require ninety days advance notice of any matters to be brought before the stockholders at an annual or special meeting.\nIn addition, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms, rights and preferences of this preferred stock, including voting rights of those shares, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. At December 31, 2019, 1,370,710 shares of preferred stock remained unissued. The rights of the holders of common stock may be subordinate to, and adversely affected by, the rights of holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock, even at a premium over our public trading price.\nFurthermore, our certificate of incorporation also provides for a classified board of directors with directors divided into three classes serving staggered terms. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us without action by our stockholders and, therefore, could adversely affect the price of our stock or the possibility of sale of shares to an acquiring person.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.", "PERMNO": 79006, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "SCON"}
