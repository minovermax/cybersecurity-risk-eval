{"cik": "1280776", "company": "VITAL THERAPIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding to invest in our company or deciding to maintain or increase or decrease your investment, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below. The risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, are not the only ones we face. If one or more of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In January, 2019, we entered into an Exchange Agreement with Immunic AG, or Immunic, pursuant to which, subject to the approval of our stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, Immunic would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vital Therapies, or the Company, referred to herein as the Transaction. If the Transaction is completed, which could be as early as the first half of April, the business of Immunic will become the business of the Company. Additional information regarding the Transaction including risk factors related to Immunic can be found in our registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2019.\nRisks Related to the Transaction\nThe Exchange Ratio is not adjustable based on the market price of our common stock so the Transaction consideration at the closing may have a greater or lesser value than at the time the Exchange Agreement was signed.\nThe relative proportion of the Company that the our existing stockholders will own when the Transaction closes will be based on the relative valuations of the Company and Immunic as negotiated by the parties and as specified in the Exchange Agreement. Following the completion of the Transaction, (a) our existing stockholders are expected to own approximately 11% of the common stock of the Company and (b) Immunic shareholders are expected to own approximately 89% of the common stock of the Company, on a fully-diluted basis (including shares issued in a concurrent financing by Immunic), assuming that Immunic closes its concurrent financing immediately prior to the effective time of the Transaction. These estimates are based on the anticipated exchange ratio, or the Exchange Ratio, and are subject to adjustment as provided in the Exchange Agreement. Fluctuations in our stock price will not affect our valuation under the Exchange Agreement or the portion of the company to be retained by our existing stockholders. The terms of the Exchange Agreement provide for adjustments to the relative valuations of both Vital Therapies and Immunic in certain events. For example, prior to the consummation of the Transaction, the Exchange Ratio at the closing of the Transaction may be subject to either (i) an upward adjustment to the extent that our net cash at the effective time of the Transaction is less than $4,200,000 (and as a result, our existing securityholders could own less, and Immunic securityholders could own more, of the Company) or (ii) a downward adjustment to the extent that our net cash at the effective time of the Transaction is greater than $5,200,000 (and as a result, our existing securityholders could own more, and Immunic securityholders could own less, of the Company). In addition, if our net cash at the effective time of the Transaction is less than a specified minimum amount of approximately $1,500,000, the Exchange Ratio at the closing of the Transaction may be subject to an additional upward adjustment (and as a result, our existing securityholders could own less, and Immunic securityholders could own more, of the Company). The minimum specified amount will be $1,500,000 if the Transaction closes on or before March 31, 2019, and the minimum cash will be reduced by $5,000 for each day (including any partial day) after March 31, 2019 until the Transaction closes.\nFailure to complete the Transaction may result in the Company paying a termination fee to Immunic and could harm the our common stock price and our future business and operations.\nIf the Transaction is not completed, we are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\nwe may be required to pay Immunic a termination fee of $500,000 and/or up to $275,000 in expense reimbursements;\n\u2022\nthe price of our common stock may decline and remain volatile;\n\u2022\nwe will have incurred significant expenses related to the Transaction, such as legal and accounting fees, which we estimate will total approximately $1.4 million, many of which must be paid even if the Transaction is not completed; and\n\u2022\nwe may be forced to cease its operations, dissolve and liquidate its assets.\nIn addition, if the Exchange Agreement is terminated and our the board of directors determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that we will be able to find a partner willing to provide equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided in the Transaction or any partner at all.\nIf the conditions to the closing of the Transaction are not met, the Transaction may not occur.\nEven if the change of control and related share issuance are approved by our stockholders, specified conditions must be\nsatisfied or waived to complete the Transaction. These conditions are set forth in the Exchange Agreement, including Immunic\u2019s concurrent financing. We cannot assure you that all of the conditions will be satisfied or waived. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Transaction may not occur or will be delayed, and we would lose the intended benefits of the Transaction.\nThe Transaction may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the Transaction, industry-wide changes and other causes.\nIn general, either the Company or Immunic can refuse to complete the Transaction if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party between January 6, 2019, the date of the Exchange Agreement, and the closing of the Transaction. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Transaction, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on the Company or Immunic, including:\n\u2022\nany rejection by a governmental body of a registration or filing by the Company or Immunic relating to their respective intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nany change in the cash position of the Company or Immunic that results from operations in the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nconditions generally affecting the industries in which the Company or Immunic participates or the U.S. or global economy or capital markets as a whole, to the extent that such conditions do not have a disproportionate impact on the Company or Immunic and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole;\n\u2022\nany failure by Immunic to meet internal projections or forecasts on or after the date of the Exchange Agreement, provided that any such effect, change, event, circumstance or development causing or contributing to any such failure to meet projections or forecasts may constitute a material adverse effect of the Company or Immunic and may be taken into account in determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet internal projections or forecasts or third-party predictions for any period ending (or for which results are released) on or after the date of the Exchange Agreement or any change in the price or trading volume of the our common stock, provided that any such effect, change, event, circumstance or development causing or contributing to any such failure to meet projections or forecasts may constitute a material adverse effect and may be taken into account in determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred;\n\u2022\nthe execution, delivery, announcement or performance of obligations under the Exchange Agreement or the announcement, pendency or anticipated consummation of the Transaction or Immunic\u2019s concurrent financing;\n\u2022\na transfer, sale, lease, disposition or license of our assets that is permitted under the Exchange Agreement;\n\u2022\nany natural disaster or any acts of terrorism, sabotage, military action or war or any escalation or worsening thereof; or\n\u2022\nany changes after the date of the Exchange Agreement in U.S. GAAP or applicable laws.\nIf adverse changes occur and we still complete the Transaction, our stock price following the closing of the Transaction may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the Transaction to our stockholders.\nSome of our executive officers and directors have interests in the Transaction that are different from yours and that may influence them to support or approve the Transaction without regard to your interests.\nSome of our officers and directors are parties to arrangements that provide them with interests in the Transaction that are different from yours, including, among others, service as an officer or director of the company following the closing of the Transaction, severance and retention benefits, the acceleration of equity award vesting, and continued indemnification.\nThe market price of our common stock following the Transaction may decline as a result of the Transaction.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Transaction for a number of reasons, including if:\n\u2022\ninvestors react negatively to the prospects of our business and prospects following the closing of the Transaction;\n\u2022\nthe effect of the Transaction on our business and prospects following the closing of the Transaction is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or\n\u2022\nwe do not achieve the perceived benefits of the Transaction as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by stockholders or financial or industry analysts.\nOur stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in, and will exercise less influence over the management of, the Company following the closing of the Transaction as compared to their current ownership and voting interest.\nAfter the completion of the Transaction, our stockholders will own a smaller percentage of the Company than their ownership prior to the Transaction. Immediately after the Transaction, it is currently estimated that Immunic securityholders will own approximately 89% of the common stock of the Company, with our current stockholders, whose shares of our common stock will remain outstanding after the Transaction, will own approximately 11% of the common stock of the Company on a fully-diluted basis, calculated on a pro forma basis including after giving effect to (i) the issuance of common shares by Immunic immediately prior to the effective time of the Transaction pursuant to a concurrent investment, and (ii) the Transaction. These estimates are based on the anticipated Exchange Ratio and are subject to adjustment as provided in the Exchange Agreement.\nIn addition, the five member board of directors of the Company will initially consist of four individuals with prior affiliations with Immunic and Dr. Duane D. Nash, currently Chief Executive Officer, President and a director of the Company. Consequently, our current stockholders will exercise substantially less influence over the management and policies of the Company following the closing of the Transaction.\nDuring the pendency of the Transaction, we may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the Exchange Agreement, which could adversely affect our businesses.\nCovenants in the Exchange Agreement impede our ability to make acquisitions, subject to specified exceptions relating to fiduciary duties or complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the Transaction. As a result, if the Transaction is not completed, we may be at a disadvantage to their competitors during that period. In addition, while the Exchange Agreement is in effect, we are generally prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into specified extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination, with any third party, subject to specified exceptions, even if any such transactions could be favorable to us.\nCertain provisions of the Exchange Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting competing proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Exchange Agreement.\nThe terms of the Exchange Agreement prohibit us from soliciting competing proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except in limited circumstances when our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor, if any, and outside counsel, that an unsolicited competing proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a superior competing proposal and that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the board of directors. In addition, if we terminate the Exchange Agreement under specified circumstances, including terminating because of a decision of a board of directors to recommend a superior competing proposal, we may be required to pay Immunic a termination fee of $500,000 and/or up to $275,000 in expense reimbursements. This termination fee may discourage third parties from submitting competing proposals to our stockholders, and may cause our board of directors to be less inclined to recommend a competing proposal.\nBecause the lack of a public market for Immunic\u2019s capital stock makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the Transaction, we may pay more than the fair market value of Immunic\u2019s capital stock.\nThe outstanding capital stock of Immunic is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of Immunic\u2019s capital stock. Because the percentage of the Company\u2019s equity to be issued to Immunic shareholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that we may pay more than the aggregate fair market value for Immunic\u2019s capital stock.\nRisks Related to Our Evaluation of Strategic Alternatives\nOur activities to evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives may not be successful.\nIn September 2018, we voluntarily discontinued our development of our product candidate, the ELAD\u00ae System, or ELAD, in view of the results of our VTL-308 phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S. and Europe. We have engaged Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., as a financial advisor to assist us in pursuing strategic alternatives, and on January 7, 2019, we announced that we had entered in to the Exchange Agreement. We continue to evaluate additional strategic alternatives in order to enhance stockholder value, including the possibility of a sale of our assets related to the ELAD System, and we have suspended many of our research and development activities to reduce operating expenses while we evaluate and pursue these opportunities. We have and expect to continue to devote significant time and resources to identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives, including the Transaction; however, there can be no assurance that the Transaction or other such activities will enhance stockholder value. In addition, potential strategic transactions that require stockholder approval, such as the\nTransaction and the related matters stockholders are being asked to approve, may not be approved by our stockholders. Further, any strategic transaction that is completed ultimately may not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance stockholder value.\nAny strategic transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near- and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022exposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022write downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges;\n\u2022increased amortization expenses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership;\n\u2022\nthe inability to sell assets or to reduce its leased space; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to retain key employees of our company or any acquired businesses.\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any strategic transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we do not successfully consummate a strategic transaction, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend significantly on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities.\nThere can be no assurance that the Transaction or any other strategic transactions we may identify or undertake, including the possible sale of our assets, will result in one or more successfully consummated transactions. If the Transaction is not completed, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision and, ultimately, such liquidation, since the amount of cash available for distribution continues to decrease as we fund our operations while we continue to pursue our strategic alternatives. In addition, if our board of directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of our company, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. Our commitments and contingent liabilities may include (i) regulatory and clinical obligations; (ii) obligations under our employment and related agreements with certain employees that provide for severance and other payments following a termination of employment occurring for various reasons, including a change in control of our company; (iii) potential litigation against us, and other various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business; and (iv) non-cancelable facility lease obligations. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of our company. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our board of directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company.\nOur business to date has been almost entirely dependent on the success of ELAD and we have recently decided to discontinue further development of ELAD in the U.S. and Europe, and devote significant time and resources to identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives, which may not be successful.\nTo date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources into the research and development of the ELAD System, which was our only product candidate to enter clinical trials. In September 2018, we voluntarily discontinued our development of ELAD in the U.S. and Europe in view of the results of our VTL-308 phase 3 clinical trial.\nWe are evaluating and pursuing strategic alternatives with a goal to enhance stockholder value , including the Transaction and the potential sale of assets, and have suspended most of our research and development activities, other than our early stage normothermic liver perfusion program, to reduce operating expenses while we focus on closing the Transaction and pursuing other strategic alternatives with respect to the sale of assets.\nThere can be no assurance that our efforts to sell certain of our assets will result in any definitive agreement to buy such assets or if made, what the terms thereof will be or that the Transaction or any asset sale will be approved or consummated. In addition, there can be no assurance that any transactions, involving our company and/or assets, that is consummated would enhance stockholder value. There also can be no assurance that we will conduct additional research or development activities in the future.\nWe are substantially dependent on our remaining employees to facilitate the consummation of a strategic transaction. We could lose such key employees, in particular, as a result of the VTL-308 data and the reduction in our workforce that we announced in September 2018.\nIn September 2018, we instituted across the board expense reductions to conserve capital, including a workforce reduction of approximately 85%. Our cash conservation activities may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce and reduced employee morale, which may cause remaining employees to seek alternative employment. Our ability to successfully complete a strategic transaction, including the Transaction, depends in large part on our ability to retain certain of our remaining personnel, particularly Duane D. Nash M.D., our Chief Executive Officer and President, Robert A. Ashley, our Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Michael V. Swanson, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and John M. Dunn, our General Counsel and Secretary. Despite our efforts to retain these employees, one or more may terminate their employment with us on short notice. The loss of the services of any of these employees could potentially harm our ability to evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives, as well as fulfill our reporting obligations as a public company.\nCompetition among biotechnology companies for qualified employees is intense, and the ability to retain our key employees is critical to our ability to effectively manage our resources and to consummate a strategic transaction. Although we have suspended most of our research and development activities, if we resume the development of ELAD outside the U.S. or of new therapeutic products, such development requires expertise from a number of different disciplines, some of which are not widely available. The failure of the VTL-308 clinical trial will likely make it more challenging to retain qualified personnel and difficult to recruit personnel in the future, if necessary. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive, key employee, consultant or advisor may impede our ability to identify and execute on a strategic path forward.\nOur key employees have a significant amount of know-how and experience in our company, and the loss of one or more of them could have a material and adverse effect on our operations or ability to consummate a strategic transaction. While we have taken steps to retain our employees, including the granting of equity awards, paying competitive salaries and implementing appropriate bonus programs, these factors may not be enough to retain the employees that we need, particularly in light of the recent failure of our VTL-308 clinical trial and the scaling back of our operations.\nThe loss of the services of existing personnel or the failure to recruit additional, suitable key scientific, managerial, clinical, regulatory, operational and other personnel in a timely manner, if required, could harm our business. We may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly-skilled employees with appropriate qualifications as needed, particularly in light of the recent failure of our VTL-308 clinical trial. If we fail to retain and motivate our current personnel or fail to attract new personnel, our business and future growth prospects and our ability to consummate a strategic transaction would be harmed.\nFurthermore, while we have entered into employment letters with each of our executive officers, any of them could leave our employment at any time, as all of our employees are \u201cat will\u201d employees. It can be challenging to retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive, key employee, consultant or advisor may impede our ability to identify and execute on our strategy.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe were dependent on the success of the ELAD System, and we do not expect be able to complete the development of, successfully obtain regulatory or marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize, the ELAD System in the United States, or the U.S., or Europe.\nWe are subject to all of the uncertainties and complexities affecting a clinical-stage, combination product, biologic and medical device company. We have not successfully completed clinical development for any of the ELAD System\u2019s potential indications in the U.S. or Europe where the ELAD System is regulated as a combination biologic and medical device, and as a combined somatic cell Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product, respectively. In September 2018, we announced that our VTL-308 clinical trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. In light of these results, we do not believe that the ELAD System can be approved in the U.S. or Europe, if ever, without additional clinical trials that would require substantial capital and time to complete. Consequently, we have ceased any further development of the ELAD System and are exploring strategic options including the potential sale of these assets. We do not have any other product candidates in our near-term product pipeline, other than our normothermic liver perfusion program which is early in development.\nOur VTL-308 clinical trial was performed in certain subjects with severe alcoholic hepatitis, or sAH. Any additional indications we elect to pursue in future trials will require the initiation and completion of additional phase 3 clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy for each such indication. For example, even prior to our VTI-208 clinical trial, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, had noted its view that preliminary clinical evidence did not indicate that the ELAD System may demonstrate a substantial improvement over standard of care. Since then, our VTI-208 and VTL-308 clinical trials failed to meet both their primary and secondary endpoints. There is no guarantee that any potential future clinical trials would be completed in a timely fashion or would succeed. Further, there can be no assurance that any potential future clinical trials will be timely, successful, or that regulators will approve the ELAD System in a timely manner, or at all. Finally, even if clinical testing of the ELAD System is resumed in the future and the ELAD System is subsequently proven to be safe and effective and ultimately receives regulatory approval, there is no guarantee that its commercialization would be successful.\nWe are a clinical-stage company with no approved products, which makes assessment of our future viability and performance difficult.\nWe are a clinical-stage company, and we have no approved products or revenues from the sale of products. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing, staffing and financing our company, applying for patent rights, manufacturing on a clinical scale, undertaking clinical trials, and engaging in research and development. Our VTL-308, VTI-208, VTI-210 and VTI-212 trials failed to reach both their primary and secondary endpoints or were terminated. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval, manufacture products on a commercial scale, or conduct the sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. As a result, there is limited information about us for investors to use when assessing our future viability and our potential to successfully develop product candidates, conduct clinical trials, manufacture our products on a commercial scale, obtain regulatory approval or profitably commercialize any approved products.\nWe have not obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates in the U.S. or any other country, and we do not believe that the ELAD System can obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. or Europe, if ever, without additional clinical trials that would require substantial capital and time to complete.\nWe must obtain regulatory approval for each indication we seek before we can market and sell the ELAD System in a particular jurisdiction for such indication. To date, we have not applied for or received the regulatory approvals required for the commercial sale of the ELAD System for any indication in the United States or Europe. In light of the clinical results from our VTL-308 clinical trial, we do not believe that the ELAD System can be approved in the U.S. or Europe, if ever, without additional clinical trials that would require substantial capital and time to complete.\nAlthough we have suspended our research and development activities related to the ELAD System, if we resume development, and if we were able to secure marketing approval, our commercial success would be determined by our ability to obtain acceptable pricing and reimbursement for the ELAD System.\nAlthough we have suspended our research and development activities related to the ELAD System, if we resume the development of the ELAD System, therapies such as the ELAD System are paid for primarily by private and government insurance, although in some markets payment may be made by private individuals and their families. Reimbursement policies and decisions for medical products is a highly bureaucratic, politicized and regulated process that includes consideration of factors such as cost effectiveness and meaningful patient benefit. Government and third-party payors are under great pressure to reduce costs. Furthermore, there are no therapies approved to restore liver function and the lack of an established reimbursement structure introduces additional uncertainty with regard to reimbursement for the ELAD System. Although we do not expect to pursue regulatory approval of the ELAD System at this time, we believe it may be difficult to sustain a commercial price outside of the U.S. at or above the commercial price within the U.S. In addition, we will have no control over the reimbursement or conditions that may be set by the government or private insurers, if any, assuming we were able to secure marketing approval for the ELAD System. In markets where payment would be made by private individuals and their families, such private payors may not be prepared to pay an acceptable price.\nAlthough we have suspended our research and development activities related to the ELAD System, if we resume development, and if we are unable to implement our sales, marketing, distribution, training and support strategies in the U.S. and Europe or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions in markets outside of the U.S. and Europe, we would not be able to effectively commercialize the ELAD System or any other product candidates and may not reach profitability.\nAlthough we have suspended our research and development activities, if we resume the development of the ELAD System or of any other product candidates, we may not be able to effectively commercialize any potential product candidates. Our technology is new and complex, and potential customers will have limited knowledge of, or experience with, such a product. In addition, we have no related sales and marketing experience either domestically or abroad. We have not commercialized any products anywhere. Our commercial success would depend on our ability to market and receive adequate reimbursement. This success would also depend on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate pricing.\nFurther, we do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of biologic products and medical devices. To achieve commercial success of any product candidates, assuming we were to obtain marketing approval, we would need to establish a sales and marketing organization, and we are unable to currently predict how we would market any such product candidates.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception and expect to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. Even if we ultimately achieve profitability, it may not be sustained, and we may require additional capital.\nWe are a clinical-stage company, and clinical development of a novel therapy is a highly speculative undertaking. We have incurred significant losses in each fiscal year since our inception, including net losses of $41.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and $52.1 million, $41.0 million and $52.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $337.4 million Even though we discontinued most of our research efforts in September 2018, we expect to continue to spend a considerable amount of our resources on strategic opportunities. We continue to incur expenses related to the pursuit of strategic alternatives, including the Transaction, and we expect these expenses will increase as we work towards obtaining stockholder approval and closing of the Transaction, and as we continue to evaluate opportunities to sell assets. We also may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on our decisions on strategic alternatives. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe anticipate incurring additional losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. We are not currently generating revenues, and we cannot estimate with precision the extent of our future losses. We do not currently have any products that are available for commercial sale, we may never generate significant revenue from selling products or achieve profitability and we may never resume the development of the ELAD System or complete the development of any other product candidates. We do not have a product candidate that has been approved for marketing in the United States or elsewhere, and we may never receive any such approval. Our two most recent clinical trials, VTI-208 and VTL-308, failed to reach both their primary and secondary endpoints. Our only product in development is our normothermic liver perfusion program, which is too early in development to assess its product value or potential product sales. If we do develop or acquire other product candidates, we would expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly. If we do acquire a new product candidate and successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for it, we also expect to incur significant sales and marketing expenses.\nWe have suspended most of our research and development activities to reduce operating expenses while we continue to pursue closing of the Transaction and efforts to sell assets. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we evaluate these strategic alternatives and continue our efforts to close the Transaction.\nAs a result of these factors, we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. These losses have had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity, financial position, cash flows and working capital. We are uncertain when or if we will achieve profitability and, if so, whether we will be able to sustain it. Our ability to produce revenue and achieve profitability is dependent on our ability to complete the development of product candidates, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, and to successfully manufacture and market products. We cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable even if we successfully enter into strategic transactions or commercialize products. Failure to become and remain profitable or the perception that we may never become profitable would adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations.\nAlthough we have suspended most of our research and development activities, if we resume the clinical development of any product candidates, we would need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and, if we were then unable to obtain such financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of any potential product candidates.\nWe have a history of incurring losses and negative cash flows from operations and have an accumulated deficit of $337.4 million through December 31, 2018. Based on our current employees, our known commitments, and our ongoing administrative costs to explore and pursue strategic options, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of $13.3 million as of December 31, 2018 should be sufficient to meet our known liabilities and commitments as of December 31, 2018; however, we expect our resource requirements to change materially to the extent we enter into the Transaction or any other strategic alternatives. To advance the development of product candidates, we would need to obtain additional financing and increase our expenditures.\nAdequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate any potential future research and development programs or potential future commercialization efforts. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operating requirements is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We have based this forecast on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe timing and structure of any strategic options that are being considered by us, including the Transaction and any potential asset sales;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish new collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of any future product candidates we pursue (if any);\n\u2022\nthe timing and progress in the development of our normothermic liver perfusion program;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of research and development and future clinical trials, if any, related to the ELAD System or other product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of any regulatory submissions;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of scaling up and validating the manufacturing process for the ELAD System or any other potential product candidates for commercialization;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of commercialization activities, including reimbursement, marketing, sales and distribution costs, both before and after product approval (if any);\n\u2022\nthe costs involved with being a public company;\n\u2022\nthe cost, timing and outcome of any future litigation;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patents, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and\n\u2022\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties, if any, on the ELAD System and any future product candidates.\nWe may finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, license agreements, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, marketing or distribution arrangements or a combination thereof. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. General market conditions or the market price of our common stock may not support capital raising transactions such as an additional public or private offering of our common stock or other securities. In addition, our ability to raise additional capital may be dependent upon our stock being quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, or upon obtaining stockholder approval. On October 25, 2018, we received a letter from the staff of Nasdaq providing notification that, for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for our common stock was below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement, or the Bid Price Requirement, for continued listing on Nasdaq. The notification had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock. In accordance with Nasdaq listing rules, we were afforded 180 calendar days, or until April 23, 2019, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq or that we will be able to obtain\nstockholder approval, if it is necessary, to take the steps needed to remedy the Bid Price Requirement. If our common stock is delisted, this would, among other things, substantially impair our ability to close the Transaction and limit our strategic alternatives, and result in fewer development opportunities. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to close our operations.\nWe may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Our inability to obtain additional funding when we need it could seriously harm our business.\nIf we resume the clinical development of any product candidates, additional capital that we may need to operate or expand our business may not be available.\nWe may require additional capital to operate or expand our business. The failure of the VTL-308 clinical trial to meet its primary or secondary endpoints may make it very difficult for us to seek and obtain financing from the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock could be substantially diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Furthermore, volatility in the credit or equity markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt or equity financing or the cost of such financing. If we do not have funds available to enhance any potential product candidates, maintain the competitiveness of our technology and pursue business opportunities, this could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $208.6 million and $203.0 million (prior to our adjustments for uncertain tax positions), net of estimated limitations caused by certain ownership changes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. In general, under Section 382, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOL and tax credit carryforwards. We believe our existing NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo any further ownership changes, such as in connection with the Transaction, our ability to utilize NOL and tax credit carryforwards could be further limited. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could also result in additional ownership changes under Section 382. The strategic options that we are pursuing, including the Transaction, will create an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which would limit all or substantially all of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs and tax credit carryforwards of companies that we may acquire in the future, if any, may be subject to limitations.\nFurthermore, in 2013, California adopted a single factor, sales, for apportioning income and losses to the state. Although completely offset by our valuation allowance, we had recognized NOL and tax credit carryforwards from 2013 through 2017 based on a multiple factor apportionment based on salaries, property and sales in the state. This position was based on prior court rulings supporting the use of the multiple factor apportionment. This ruling was overturned by the California Supreme Court in December 2015, and, in October 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case. California has no regulations or guidance nor have there been any rulings addressing how a company with no sales should apportion losses to California. As most of our operations are in California, we have filed our tax returns using a multiple factor apportionment. For these reasons and due to the limitations discussed above, we likely will not be able to utilize all or substantially all of such NOL and tax credit carryforwards, even if we attain profitability.\nWe conduct business and file income tax returns in various tax jurisdictions. Our tax position could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control. For example, in the U.S., recently enacted U.S. tax reform in December 2017 commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, may have a negative impact on our business. In addition, it is possible that further changes to the U.S. tax code and the tax rules in the other jurisdictions could occur in the near future. Although we monitor these developments, it is not possible to assess to what extent changes may be implemented in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, what impact they may have on the way in which we conduct our business, or how they may impact our effective tax rate due to the unpredictability and interdependency of these potential changes. Even though we maintain a full valuation allowance to offset our NOL and tax credit carryforwards, changes in tax laws and related regulations and practices could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, cash flows, effective tax rate, financial position and results of operations and likelihood of consummating a strategic transaction.\nOur internal computer systems, cloud-based systems and those systems previously used, or that may in the future be used, by our clinical investigators, contract research organizations or other contractors or consultants may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of any of our development programs.\nWe rely on information technology systems to keep financial records, maintain laboratory information, clinical data and corporate records, communicate with staff and external parties and operate other critical functions. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, cloud-based systems and those systems previously used, or that may in the future be used, by us, our clinical investigators, clinical research organizations, or CROs, and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. The techniques that could be used to attack these computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, we may not be able to address these risks proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. While, to our knowledge, we have not experienced any significant system failure, theft of information, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of any clinical development or manufacturing activities. For example, the loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in future regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption, theft of information, or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and any future clinical development or other development of product candidates could be delayed.\nIn the recent past, we have been involved in securities litigation, and defending against such litigation or an adverse resolution of such litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and ability to consummate strategic transactions.\nOur industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation, including claims regarding patent or other intellectual property rights, as well as product liability. Additionally, in the past, companies that experience volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. For example, following our announcement that the ELAD System, our sole product candidate, failed to meet its primary and secondary endpoints in our VTI-208 phase 3 clinical trial, we became the subject of a lawsuit alleging securities law violations. Although this litigation was dismissed, this type of litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and divert management's attention, and the outcome can be difficult to predict regardless of the facts involved. We are at a heightened risk of, and could be subject to, additional litigation following our announcement in September 2018 that the ELAD System failed to meet its primary and secondary endpoints in our VTL-308 phase 3 clinical trial. An unfavorable outcome with respect to a lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and ability to consummate strategic transactions.\nRisks Related to the ELAD System\u2019s or other Product Candidates' Potential Future Clinical Development\nIf we resume the clinical development of any product candidates, we have limited experience in conducting pivotal clinical trials used to support regulatory approval, and our prior clinical trials of the ELAD System did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in survival, the primary endpoint that was needed to support regulatory approval.\nOur VTI-208 phase 3 randomized, controlled, open-label trial evaluating the ELAD System in subjects primarily with severe alcoholic hepatitis, or sAH, failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival through at least 91 days assessed using the Kaplan Meier statistical method. Our protocol for our subsequent clinical trial of the ELAD system in sAH, VTL-308, incorporated limits on subjects' age, model for end-stage liver disease score, or MELD score, and its three components. While the endpoints and populations for VTL-308 were derived from results of our prior studies, including the results of VTI-208, and based on medical literature, in none of those prior studies had we demonstrated a statistically significant effect on the population based on the endpoints prospectively described in the study plan. Our prior clinical trials of the ELAD System in sAH did not demonstrate statistically significant improvement over standard of care in the primary endpoint of survival through at least study day ninety-one. Similarly, our prior clinical trials of the ELAD System in fulminant hepatic failure, or FHF, did not demonstrate statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of 28-day survival. In September 2018, we announced that the VTL-308 clinical trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints. The lack of statistical significance from these previous trials could be attributed to various factors, including the lack of power to demonstrate significance, the design of the studies and the lack of an ELAD System treatment benefit.\nIf we resume the clinical development of the ELAD System or any other product candidate, any positive results from previous clinical trials may not be predictive of future results.\nAny positive results from our prior clinical trials, including either statistical significance in some endpoints or trends towards statistical significance in other endpoints, should not be relied upon as evidence that our potential future clinical trials will necessarily succeed. For example, our primary endpoint in VTL-308 was based on the results of a subset of subjects in our VTI-208 clinical trial. Additionally, our primary endpoint in VTI-208 was based on the results of a subset of subjects in our VTI-206 clinical trial. Although these subsets showed a trend toward increased survival up to at least study day ninety-one, the subsequent trials still failed to meet their primary and secondary endpoints. The FDA has noted its belief that this preliminary clinical evidence did not indicate that our product may demonstrate a substantial improvement over standard of care. We cannot provide any guarantee that any potential future clinical trials of any product candidates will provide statistically significant data sufficient to support regulatory approval.\nRandom variation or changes in standard of care could cause any potential future clinical trials to be delayed and/or fail.\nRegulatory authorities worldwide have adopted the standard that, to gain marketing approval, clinical trials should produce a result that has less than a 5% probability of being due to random variation. There is no assurance that any of our potential future clinical trials will meet that standard. In addition, we have designed all of our past clinical trials to be judged by a survival primary endpoint, which may have been difficult to achieve for many reasons, including unanticipated survival rates of control subjects due to random variations, deficiencies in our exclusion and inclusion criteria, and the standard of care of the subjects, which may vary from site to site and country to country and is continuously evolving. Such difficulties may continue in any potential future clinical trials.\nAny of these factors, which are beyond our control, could materially and adversely affect the results of any potential future trials and prevent us from gaining regulatory approval of any product candidates. In addition, even if the results of any potential future clinical programs are positive, our inability to control or adequately account for these factors between treatment arms could cause the FDA or other regulatory authorities to determine that the results are not adequate, or must be reproduced in a confirmatory study, to support marketing approval.\nIf we resume clinical development, the ELAD System treatment could result in significant clinical risks to the patient, including death.\nThe ELAD System therapy was targeted toward very sick patients who were likely to die if left untreated. Patients with liver failure resulting from acute hepatocellular insult quickly develop failure of other organs including lungs, kidney, brain, and blood coagulation systems. Patients who received the ELAD System therapy were at risk of dying due to other serious health problems even if the ELAD System was demonstrated to be effective.\nAll extracorporeal therapy systems, including the ELAD System, cause a decline in blood platelets, which can lead to coagulation problems and uncontrolled bleeding because platelets are critical to clot formation. Patients with liver failure generally have serious blood clotting problems since the liver produces almost all of the body\u2019s blood clotting proteins. These patients therefore have wide variations in their ability to coagulate their blood. To minimize blood clotting issues during ELAD treatment, some subjects require an infusion of anti-coagulants, which can aggravate bleeding. Because every subject is different, the need for anti-coagulant therapy is variable and must be closely monitored during ELAD System therapy. The risk of uncontrolled bleeding may be treated during the ELAD System therapy by administering platelet transfusions or by administering blood coagulation factors. However, there have been cases of uncontrolled bleeding during and after the ELAD System therapy. Additionally, some patients have abnormal red blood cells, which have weakened cell walls subject to rupture by physical force, a process known as hemolysis. The physical force exerted on the red blood cells by the ultrafiltrate generator in the ELAD System line can, in some cases, be enough to cause overt mechanical hemolysis that resolves after ELAD treatment is stopped, but can result in death if it continues too long. The incidence of hemolysis was less than 0.5% in subjects enrolled in our prior clinical trials, and one patient died in our China trial as a result of hemolysis.\nData from our prior clinical trials suggest that ELAD treatment should not be used in subjects with acute kidney injury (defined as a serum creatinine level of greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL). The use of extracorporeal systems such as ELAD may cause harm in patients with pre-existing kidney injury because these subjects are at an increased risk to develop fluid overload due to the renal impairment. Furthermore, ELAD treatment should be stopped if a patient develops any indication for renal replacement therapy, because patients with renal impairment are less likely to be able to tolerate the increased stresses associated with two extracorporeal devices requiring high venous flow rates.\nSimilarly, data from our prior clinical trials suggest that ELAD treatment should not be used in subjects with severe coagulopathy (problems with blood clotting, defined as an International Normalized Ratio, or INR, of greater than 2.5). The use of extracorporeal systems such as ELAD may cause harm in patients with pre-existing severe coagulopathy because the circulation of blood outside the body can cause a depletion in circulating factors associated with the blood clotting cascade, and reductions in the number of circulating platelets in the blood which are required for the blood to clot properly. As a result, subjects on extracorporeal systems such as ELAD are at an increased risk to develop bleeding issues.\nHuman liver-derived C3A cells have been shown in animal studies to have the capacity to grow into a tumor mass under certain conditions. While it is possible that some VTL C3A cells could escape from the ELAD cartridges and cause tumors in patients or produce substances that could lead to the development of malignant tumors, it is expected within the natural medical history of this population of patients with chronic liver disease (whether caused by hepatitis B or alcohol) that a certain incidence of cancer will be reported. There was no evidence that the incidence or type of cancer was different between the ELAD and the control groups in our study in China. There have been two reported cancers (rectal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma) in our extended follow-up of ELAD-treated subjects from the VTI-208 study and there have been no such reported cases of cancer in VTL-308. These or other adverse events, even those that are currently unforeseen, could significantly affect any potential future development and commercialization efforts, cause the regulatory authorities to place any potential future clinical trials on hold or to refuse to grant or maintain any potential future marketing approval or result in withdrawal of the ELAD System from the market in the event that development of the ELAD System is resumed and ultimately receives marketing approval.\nDue to ethical considerations, we have conducted open-label clinical trials of the ELAD System, where control subjects do not receive a sham treatment, and this could introduce unacceptable bias into any future trial results.\nWe did not conduct our VTI-208, VTI-210, VTI-212 or VTL-308 clinical trials with a sham control extracorporeal circuit that includes empty cartridges. This is due to the potential harm that the extracorporeal circuit can cause to control subjects without the potential for any benefit, which makes it unethical to subject the controls to a sham. Although regulatory agencies agree that, due to the nature of the ELAD System therapy, it is not possible to conduct a blinded study, they have expressed concern that the open-label nature of the study design may introduce significant bias in the treatment of the ELAD System or control subjects, since the study subject, physicians and caregivers know who has and has not received the ELAD System therapy. We had developed a protocol that attempted to minimize this bias to the extent possible, including defining a protocol-specific standard of care, specifying steroid treatment, standardizing the discharge criteria for both the ELAD-treated and control subjects, requiring that follow-up visits are conducted by a blinded reviewer, ensuring home healthcare nurses and other clinical personnel are unaware of treatment assignment, educating subjects not to reveal treatment assignment to their caregivers and monitoring concomitant medications, alcohol recidivism and interaction with the healthcare system to provide evidence that there is no meaningful difference between the groups that might have significantly confounded the trial data. However, there is no guarantee that bias will not enter into any potential future clinical trial, affect the results of such trials or cause regulatory agencies to refuse marketing approval of the ELAD System or any other product candidates.\nIf we resume the clinical development of any product candidates, and if we encounter difficulties enrolling subjects, any potential future clinical trials could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nClinical trials for the ELAD System required us to identify and enroll a large number of subjects that met all of the entry criteria set forth in our protocols, including having the disease under investigation. If we resume the development of any product candidates and conduct any future clinical trials, we may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of subjects who meet our protocol requirements in a timely manner. Subject enrollment is affected by numerous factors, many of which fall outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe size and nature of the subject population;\n\u2022\ntimeliness of contracting with clinical trial sites, and obtaining approval of the trial by the applicable institutional review boards, or IRBs, or ethics committees;\n\u2022\nlack of a sufficient number of subjects who meet the enrollment criteria for potential future clinical trials;\n\u2022\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022\navailability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nefforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nscheduling conflicts with participating clinicians; and\n\u2022\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites and resources for prospective subjects.\nIn light of results and disclosures of our prior clinical trials by us or others, it is possible that subjects will be less willing to participate in any potential future trials. Even if we were to identify an appropriate subject population for a clinical trial, there can be no assurance that the subjects will elect to enroll in the study or complete the study. These difficulties could negatively impact any potential future clinical trials.\nIf we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of subjects to conduct any potential future clinical trials or if enrolled subjects fail to complete the study or comply with our protocols, particularly with regard to follow-up appointments, the completion of any potential future clinical trials would be delayed, and our business would be harmed.\nIf we resume the clinical development of any product candidates, we may face delays in completing any potential future clinical trials, and we may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate any potential future clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive, or the clinical trials are not well-designed or executed as expected.\nAny potential future clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations governing clinical studies, and are subject to oversight by the FDA, foreign governmental agencies, ethics committees and IRBs at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials may require large numbers of test subjects. Changes in regulatory requirements may occur at any time, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect such changes. In addition, we may voluntarily amend our protocols, as we did for our VTI-210 clinical trial. Amendments may require us to resubmit any potential future clinical trial protocols to ethics committees or IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of the underlying trial.\nAny potential future clinical trials may require amendment or be delayed, not approved, unsuccessful or terminated as a result of many factors, including:\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in designing an appropriate clinical trial protocol with sufficient statistical power and in reaching agreement on trial design with investigators and regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ndelays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays or failure by CROs, investigators and clinical trial sites in ensuring the proper and timely conduct of any potential future clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or failure by us in manufacturing sufficient quantities of product pursuant to required quality standards and by third-party manufacturers in supplying the product or necessary and suitable components;\n\u2022\ndelays or failure in transporting products to clinical trial sites with sufficient rapidity to enable treatment to begin early enough to have an opportunity for clinical benefit;\n\u2022\ndelays or failure in completing data analysis and achieving primary and secondary endpoints;\n\u2022\ndelays in subject enrollment or site initiation, including in light of, among other things, our prior clinical results;\n\u2022\nregulators or clinical site ethics committees or IRBs may not approve or may delay, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or concerns about subject safety;\n\u2022\nwe may suspend or terminate any potential future clinical trials if we believe our product is exposing the participating subjects to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons;\n\u2022\nsubjects may not complete any potential future clinical trials due to safety issues, adverse events, inconvenience or other reasons;\n\u2022\nsubjects in any potential future clinical trials may die or suffer other adverse events for reasons that may be either related or unrelated to our product;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty in maintaining contact with subjects after treatment, preventing us from collecting the data required by our study protocol; and\n\u2022\nfinal analysis of the data from any potential future clinical trials may conclude that such product candidate lacks sufficient clinical efficacy or presents unacceptable safety risks, such as occurred with the VTL-308 clinical trial.\nDue to the failure of VTI-208 and VTL-308 to provide evidence of safety and efficacy sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the regulatory authorities, we do not expect the ELAD System to be approved unless we are able to perform additional clinical trials showing such safety and efficacy.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nIf we resume the clinical development of any product candidates, the FDA regulatory approval process is complex, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable. In addition, the failure of our VTL-308 and VTI-208 clinical trials may adversely affect the attitude of regulatory authorities toward any potential future development of the ELAD System.\nPotential future clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. In the U.S., the ELAD System has been regulated by the FDA as a combination biologic and medical device. Before a biologic product can be marketed in the U.S., we must submit, and the FDA must approve, a Biologics License Application, or BLA. In addition, for a combination biologic and medical device, the device components must be found acceptable as part of the BLA. The regulatory review process for a novel therapy is complex, time-consuming and unpredictable. As a result, development costs, timelines and approvals are not readily predictable.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA to market a new therapy is unpredictable but typically takes many years and depends upon many factors, including the substantial discretion of regulatory authorities.\nEven if a product shows evidence of safety and efficacy in clinical trials, it could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA may disagree with the design or implementation of the clinical trials or the study endpoints. For example, in our ELAD clinical trials, the FDA had expressed concern about the open-label design and multiplicity of confounding variables, including the need for delineating the standard of care that both the treated and control groups received during our studies;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that our product is safe and effective for its proposed indications or that the product provides significant clinically relevant benefits or that the benefits outweigh the safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe results of a clinical trial may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA for approval or may not support approval of a label that could command a price sufficient for us to be profitable;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from any preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted outside their jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nthe opportunity for bias in any potential future clinical trials as a result of the open-label design may not be adequately handled and may cause any potential future trial to fail;\n\u2022\nthe product may be subject to an FDA advisory committee review, which is triggered by an FDA request and is solely within the FDA\u2019s discretion, which may result in unexpected delays or additional hurdles to approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may determine that the manufacturing processes at our facilities or facilities of third party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies are inadequate;\n\u2022\neven if a future clinical trial is successful in demonstrating a statistically significant improvement over standard of care, in light of the fact that certain confounding factors may be viewed by the FDA as limiting the persuasiveness of the study results, a single successful phase 3 clinical trial may not be sufficient to provide the substantial evidence of effectiveness necessary to support regulatory approval, and therefore we may need more than one additional phase 3 clinical trial to secure regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA may significantly change in a manner rendering any future clinical data insufficient for approval; and\n\u2022\nthe failure of prior clinical trials could result in more stringent requirements being imposed by regulatory bodies and advisory groups.\nThe FDA expressed concern with our past phase 3 clinical trials that to the extent there are significant differences in how treated and control subjects are treated during the study and after discharge from the hospital, the study may not be able to provide convincing evidence of safety and efficacy. For example, differences in length of hospital stay, rates of hospital re-admission, alcohol recidivism rates, nutritional support, and the use of concomitant medications could significantly confound the reported study results.\nIn addition, even if we were to obtain approval following any potential future clinical trials, the FDA may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Any of the above could materially harm a product's commercial prospects.\nIf we begin or resume the clinical development of any biologic product candidates, we do not have, and may never obtain, the regulatory approvals we need to market our product.\nIn responding to a BLA, the FDA may require additional testing or information, may require that the product labeling be modified, may impose a post-approval study and other commitments or reporting requirements or other restrictions on product commercialization, or may deny the application. The FDA has established performance goals for review of BLAs; however, the FDA is not required to complete its review within these time periods. The timing of final FDA review and action varies greatly, but can take years in some cases and may involve the input of an FDA advisory committee of outside experts. Sales of the product in the United States may commence only when the BLA is approved. To date, we have not applied for or received the regulatory approvals required for the commercial sale of any product.\nIn light of the clinical results from our VTL-308 clinical trial, we do not believe that the ELAD System can be approved for marketing for sAH in the U.S. or Europe, if ever, without additional clinical trials that would require substantial capital and time to complete. Therefore, the ELAD System may never be approved for marketing.\nIf we resume the development of any product candidates, the FDA may or may not grant an accelerated or \u201cPriority Review\u201d to any potential future BLA, if requested by us, and even if the FDA designates Priority Review for any product candidate, that designation would not assure FDA approval and may not even lead to a faster regulatory review or approval process.\nOn the date the FDA receives an original BLA submission, a 60 calendar day filing review period starts. Assuming the FDA accepts the submission for filing, a ten-month standard BLA review clock begins, which means the FDA has an aggregate twelve months from its receipt of the original submission to take regulatory action. A product may be eligible for Priority Review for a BLA submission if the FDA determines that the product candidate, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A six-month Priority Review clock would begin at the conclusion of the 60 calendar day filing review period that starts on the date of FDA receipt of the original BLA submission. Therefore, if Priority Review is granted, the FDA has a total of eight months to take action on an application as opposed to the standard timeline of twelve months. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant Priority Review even if we believe a product is eligible. Moreover, even if a product is designated for Priority Review, such a designation does not assure a faster regulatory review process or confer any advantage with respect to FDA approval. Moreover, a designation of Priority Review or even a standard review from the FDA does not guarantee approval within the eight-month or twelve-month review period, respectively, or at any time thereafter. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any future BLA will be approved in a timely manner, or at all.\nIf we resume the development of any product candidates, the regulatory approval processes of foreign regulatory authorities are complex, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable.\nOutside the U.S., our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from appropriate regulatory authorities. If any potential future clinical programs were to be successful, we would anticipate submitting applications for marketing authorization in Europe and other foreign countries based on need. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country, and we may be unable to meet such requirements. If the regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, efficacy, and quality has been presented, a marketing authorization should be granted. The foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with FDA approval.\nIf any product candidate receives regulatory approval, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements and may face regulatory or enforcement action.\nIf any product receives regulatory approval, we will be subject to significant ongoing regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including regulation of our manufacturing operations and any third-party manufacturing operations to ensure our compliance with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and/or Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements for post-approval clinical data, adverse event reporting and complaint handling, and advertising and promotional activities. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may subject us to sanctions. These may include warning letters, adverse publicity, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, product seizures or detention, and refusal to approve pending product marketing applications.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in fraud, misconduct or other illegal activity or that they do not comply with regulatory standards and requirements. Misconduct or non-compliance by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activities that violate (1) FDA regulations, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, (2) quality standards, including Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and cGMP, (3) federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, (4) laws that require the reporting of true and accurate financial information and data, (5) securities laws and regulations, (6) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, or (7) General Data Protection Regulation. If we were to obtain FDA approval of any future product candidate and begin commercializing that product in the United States, our potential exposure under such laws would increase significantly, and our costs associated with compliance with such laws would also be likely to increase. In particular, research, sales, marketing, education and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are also subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of subject recruitment for clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and third parties. We may fail to identify and deter misconduct or non-compliance by employees and third parties, or the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of changes to or even the halt of any potential future clinical trials or manufacturing or civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Medical Device Components of the ELAD System or Any of Our Products\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with QSR in the U.S. or Medical Device Directives and Standards in Europe, our business would suffer.\nWe are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with applicable regulations for the manufacturing of combination biologic products, including specified parts of the QSR and European Medical Device Directives, or MDD, with\nrespect to any biological product candidates. Our third-party medical device manufacturers are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the QSR and MDD. The QSR and MDD are complex regulatory schemes that cover the methods and documentation of and for the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of the regulated products. Regulatory agencies enforce the QSR and MDD through periodic inspections. Prior to any potential approval of any such product in the U.S. and Europe, our manufacturing facility would be subject to a preapproval inspection to determine compliance with the applicable regulations, including cGMPs, parts of the QSR, the European drug cGMP regulations, and the MDD. In addition, our third-party medical device component manufacturers would be subject to a preapproval inspection to determine compliance with QSR and MDD requirements. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to pass a preapproval inspection, or to take satisfactory and prompt corrective action in response to an adverse inspection, could prevent or significantly delay approval of any product.\nThe ELAD System bedside unit is based on a cardio-pulmonary bypass system that was replaced with an updated system, and regulatory authorities may not view the systems as interchangeable, which could cause regulatory approvals to be significantly delayed should we resume development of ELAD for new indications.\nThe ELAD System bedside unit was originally based exclusively on the LivaNova (formerly Sorin) St\u00f6ckert Perfusion System S3 Double Head Pump Module, a medical device indicated for use during cardio-pulmonary bypass surgery. All or part of our early clinical trials were carried out using an ELAD System bedside unit based on LivaNova\u2019s S3 system. However, LivaNova stopped selling the S3 system and replaced it with an updated S5 system. We carried out testing of an ELAD System bedside unit based on the S5 and we believe that the S3 and S5 systems are equivalent and interchangeable from a clinical and regulatory perspective. We have submitted information to both the U.S. and the European regulatory authorities to support equivalence. Both the S3 and S5 systems were used in our VTI-208, VTI-210 and VTL-308 clinical trials. There can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will continue to view the S3 and S5 systems interchangeably, or that LivaNova would cooperate with us or provide us with the documentation necessary for inclusion in a BLA submission, if any, which would be required to obtain regulatory approval of our ELAD System. If regulatory authorities do not view the S3 and S5 systems as equivalent, or LivaNova fails to provide the information necessary for inclusion in our regulatory filings, future development and approval of the ELAD System, if any, may be significantly delayed or prevented. In addition, effective January 1, 2018, LivaNova no longer supports its S3 systems. Accordingly, if a future trial is undertaken and successful, we would expect to commercialize ELAD with only the LivaNova S5 system.\nOne of the ELAD System component suppliers was subject to an FDA consent decree, which could have forced us to find another supplier for this component.\nOne of the components of the ELAD System bedside unit is manufactured by Terumo Cardiovascular Systems, or Terumo. In March 2011, Terumo entered into a consent decree with the FDA which limited its ability to ship products from certain of its manufacturing facilities including the one that manufactures the component we used in our prior clinical trials. We received notice from Terumo in June 2016 that all restrictions listed in the 2011 consent decree were lifted. If we had been unable to source the component we use from Terumo, we would have had to source the component from an alternative supplier. If Terumo or another component supplier has similar issues in the future, there is no guarantee that a qualified alternative supplier can be found that will agree to terms reasonably acceptable to us on a timely basis or at all. This and similar situations with other suppliers could significantly delay the development of future products.\nIn the development of combination biologic and device products, changes in any of the device components could affect our ability to complete any future clinical trials or to obtain and maintain approval and commercialization efforts.\nThe device components of the ELAD System must be reviewed as part of any BLA for ELAD. If the manufacturers of those components make modifications, discontinue supplying or are unable to supply sufficient quantities of such components during any potential clinical testing or after any approval, or if we elect to change a component, we would need to perform validation testing and obtain FDA and other regulatory approval prior to using the modified or replacement component. For example, one of our suppliers of a key component in our manufacturing process was having an issue meeting all of their customer orders for the component. If we were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the component on a timely basis, there could have been a delay in enrollment in our clinical trial or, following an approval, in the marketing of ELAD until additional supplies became available, or we would be required to validate an alternative component to use, which could delay any clinical trials or the marketing of a product, and increase our costs. If the FDA or any other regulatory body fails to approve use of those modified or replacement devices or if we were unable to validate a replacement component, we would not be able to initiate or complete clinical trials or, in the future, we might not be able to market or could have to suspend marketing in certain jurisdictions.\nIf we determine to resume the clinical development of ELAD, we may be unable to demonstrate that devices cleared for different uses may be safe and effective for use in the ELAD System.\nMost device components of the ELAD System have been previously cleared for use by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. However, in many instances, we would be using the components outside the scope of their cleared indications. Other device components have no regulatory approvals. If we resume development of the ELAD System, we may need to conduct additional testing to bridge the differences between the cleared indications for use and its use in the ELAD System in order to obtain any approval, or we could be required to obtain separate clearance for one or more of the components used in the ELAD System. The failure to provide adequate bridging information or to obtain separate clearance of these device components for use in the ELAD System, if required, could delay or prevent an approval of the ELAD System should further development of the ELAD System be pursued.\nRisks Related to the Cellular Products and Related Components\nIf we fail to comply with cGMPs, our business will suffer.\nWe are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with cGMPs. The cGMPs describe the methods to be used in, and the facilities or controls to be used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a biologic to assure the biologic meets the requirements for safety, and has the quality, purity, and potency characteristics that it purports or is represented to possess. Regulatory agencies enforce these requirements through periodic inspections. Prior to any potential approval of any such product, our manufacturing facilities would be subject to a preapproval inspection to determine compliance with U.S. and European cGMPs and applicable QSR and MDD requirements or other foreign regulatory agencies. Our failure to pass such an inspection, or take satisfactory and prompt corrective action in response to an adverse inspection, could prevent or significantly delay approval of such a product.\nIn the manufacture of products, we rely on third party suppliers, and in many instances, a single third party supplier, for critical components, and these suppliers could cease to manufacture the components, go out of business or otherwise not perform as anticipated.\nWhile the growth of VTL C3A cells for ELAD is under our control, the manufacture of all of the other parts and components of the ELAD System have been undertaken by third party suppliers. We have previously relied on a single source of supply for many critical components, including components of the ELAD System bedside unit, the ultrafiltrate generator cartridges, the media we use to grow and ship our VTL C3A cells, the cartridges in which our VTL C3A cells are grown, the final cell filter cartridges and the bioreactors that have been developed to grow and store the ELAD cartridges. We have investigated additional sources of supply for some of these components to support any potential future clinical development and, ultimately, commercialization of the ELAD System. If we fail to develop additional sources of supply, and a single source of supply of a critical component of the ELAD System were to become unavailable, our ability to develop or to initiate commercialization of the ELAD System would be severely compromised should we determine to pursue the further development of ELAD for new indications or geographical regions. In addition, we have relied on third party suppliers for the safety of products of human and animal origin that are incorporated in the ELAD System production process, and these suppliers could cease to manufacture the components, inadequately test these components, go out of business or otherwise not perform as anticipated. We do not have long-term agreements with our suppliers, and we will have to purchase components on a purchase order basis. For components that are not readily available from other sources, we would be subject to the risks that our suppliers will raise their prices or impose other terms or conditions that are less favorable or unacceptable to us if we resume development of the ELAD System.\nFor instance, bovine serum, which is a component of the cell growth media, is used in the manufacture of the ELAD System cell cartridges. It is obtained from an outside supplier. We are wholly reliant on the guarantee of our supplier that the bovine serum used in our manufacturing procedures is free of transmitted animal viruses and other pathogens. Should the source of supply become infected, or the supplier become unable to continue to supply bovine serum of the quality necessary to support human use, or the regulations change such that the bovine serum cannot be used for human use, we would have to find alternative sources of supply and manufacturing methods, for which there is no guarantee of success.\nHuman albumin and Trypsin-EDTA are also used in the manufacture of ELAD System cartridges and are each provided by a single supplier. In addition, while these products were tested to be free of contamination by the supplier, we cannot guarantee that will always continue to be the case.\nIf our facility becomes inoperable, we will be unable to continue manufacturing any product candidate and as a result, our business will be harmed until we are able to secure a new facility.\nWe have manufactured our biologic product and assembled the device component at our facility in San Diego, California. No other manufacturing or assembly facilities are currently available to us, and any additional manufacturing or assembly facilities that we might use would need to be qualified and approved by regulatory authorities prior to our use. Our facility and the equipment would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead-time to repair or replace. The facility may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including fire, earthquakes, flooding and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our research, development and manufacturing for some period of time. The inability to perform our manufacturing activities, combined with our limited inventory of reserve raw materials and manufactured supplies, could result in the delay of any potential future clinical trials.\nWe often rely on third parties for certain aspects of the manufacture of our clinical products and supplies. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices or if they encounter other manufacturing issues.\nWe would expect to use third parties for certain parts of our production process for any products under development. This would expose us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any manufacturers. This approval would require new testing and good manufacturing practices compliance inspections by the FDA. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of any potential future products.\n\u2022\nAny third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely manufacture the components and custom materials and supplies we require, or to produce the quantity and quality required to meet our needs.\n\u2022\nContract manufacturers may not be able to execute or comply with our manufacturing procedures and other logistical support requirements appropriately.\n\u2022\nAny contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed, may not devote sufficient resources to us, or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business and alternative manufacturers that can meet our requirements may be difficult to identify and qualify on a timely basis, if at all.\n\u2022\nManufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practices and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards, and they are also subject to the same ongoing periodic unannounced inspection. Any license to manufacture product candidates will be subject to continued regulatory review. Failure to meet such standards could result in the need to take corrective actions and even withdrawal of product from the market.\n\u2022\nWe may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process, or in the manufacture of the custom materials used in the manufacture thereof.\n\u2022\nAny third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreement with us.\n\u2022\nAny contract manufacturers may have unacceptable or inconsistent product quality, success rates and yields.\n\u2022\nThe actual cost to manufacture and process any future product candidates could materially and adversely affect their commercial viability.\n\u2022\nAny manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints and labor disputes, as well as natural or man-made disasters.\nEach of these risks could delay or prevent the completion of any potential future clinical trials or the approval of any future product by the FDA, result in higher costs, or adversely impact commercialization. If our contract manufacturers are unable to successfully produce any components or any related supplies for potential future clinical trials or commercialization, potential future clinical trials or potential future commercial efforts would be impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe forecast the requirements for components and materials used in our products and, if our forecasts are incorrect, we may experience delays in shipments or increased inventory costs.\nIn the past, we have kept limited materials, components and, if applicable, finished product on hand. To manage our manufacturing operations with our suppliers, we forecast anticipated product orders and material requirements to predict our future inventory needs and enter into purchase orders on the basis of these requirements. Our limited historical experience may not provide us with enough data to accurately predict our future needs. Many of our components are medical devices, which have fixed future expiration dates. If we overestimate our component and material requirements, we will have excess inventory, which may have to be disposed of if it exceeds approved expiration dates, which would increase our expenses. If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt, delay or prevent delivery of our products. Any of these occurrences would negatively affect our financial performance and the level of satisfaction any potential customers or partners have with our business.\nWe may not be able to grow cells used in our products reliably and cost-effectively.\nOperations with human cells, even a stable, cell line such as the VTL C3A cells, which are used in the ELAD System, can be subject to conditions and influences that we may not be able to control. Although our VTL C3A cells are stored at three separate locations in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, or UK, it is possible that all three locations could be destroyed and we could lose all or a portion of our cell banks. It is also possible that the cells will simply cease to function. While we take precautions to prevent this from happening, we could encounter unforeseen complications. To date, we have only produced the small number of the ELAD cartridges required to support our prior clinical trials. If we were to resume development of the ELAD System and needed to increase production to support demand, we could experience significant scale-up issues, which may cause quality and cost problems and our business could be materially harmed.\nCellular therapy is complex, and we may not ever have a complete understanding of the mechanism of action of any cellular therapy.\nCellular therapy is a complex treatment with multiple variables that are not fully understood. For example, our VTL C3A cells, which were used in the ELAD cartridges produce hundreds of metabolites. Likewise, the plasma ultrafiltrate formed from blood, which has been treated by our VTL C3A cells in our ELAD cartridges, is a similarly complex material. The composition and stability of the treated blood can also be affected by the conditions of its generation in the ELAD System bedside unit, which could affect treatment outcomes. For instance, while most subjects treated with the ELAD System typically only required a single set of cartridges, some subjects required more than one set during their treatment period, which may have implications for efficacy and costs. While we believed that we had identified the key parameters of the ELAD System VTL C3A cartridges and set them in an appropriate range, it was possible that there were other variables that were important to safety and efficacy that were not anticipated.\nLikewise, the potential mechanism of action for the ELAD System remains unproven and may never be proven. The ELAD System's mechanism of action appears complex, may involve numerous pathways and we may not succeed in ever elucidating the exact role of any given pathway. Moreover, our research on mechanism of action was primarily based on laboratory studies, and needed correlation with in vivo studies and patient outcomes.\nRisks Related to Doing Business Internationally\nIf we were to do business internationally, it may prove to be difficult and fraught with economic, regulatory and political issues.\nIf we were to commercialize the ELAD System or any other product in countries where the business, economic and political climates are very different from those of the U.S., we may not be aware of some of these issues, and it may be difficult for a U.S. company to overcome these issues and ultimately become profitable. For instance, we completed our Chinese pivotal clinical trial in 2007 and submitted our data to the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, showing a statistically significant improvement in transplant-free survival among the ELAD System-treated subjects compared with control subjects. However, this application has been neither approved nor rejected and the timing and nature of any potential decision is highly uncertain. These foreign countries may also favor businesses that are owned by nationals of those countries as opposed to foreign-owned businesses operating locally. As a small company, we may not have the resources to engage in the negotiation and time-consuming work needed to overcome some of these potential issues.\nIn the event that we were to receive any marketing approval in foreign countries outside of the U.S. and Europe, we could create wholly-owned subsidiaries or work with a partner in those countries or in a region. These subsidiaries will need to build an effective sales, marketing, distribution, training and support staff and system, find an effective marketing partner or both. Any internal sales, marketing, training and support capabilities of the subsidiaries will need to be developed by these subsidiaries and will need to be built from scratch. The culture and accepted practices related to selling medical products in many foreign countries are unique, and it is possible that we will not be able to successfully penetrate these markets. We cannot guarantee that our approach to the U.S., European, Chinese or any other international market would be effective.\nThe medical systems in many foreign countries are very different from that of the U.S. and could cause significant problems for the ELAD System if foreign commercialization is pursued.\nIf we were to resume development and ultimately pursue foreign commercialization of ELAD, the medical systems in many countries around the world would pose challenges to the commercialization of the ELAD System. For instance, most medical care in China is delivered on a private pay basis, and it could be difficult to receive payment for the ELAD System therapy delivered or the price of our product, which could be relatively high, may prove to be beyond the capability of the targeted Chinese patient to pay. Further, as we have encountered in our prior clinical trials, the standard and the operation of the delivery of care in China are different, causing problems with the operation of the ELAD System therapy. These issues include the withholding of necessary medicines, the inadequate staffing of Chinese hospitals, the shortage of blood products, the differing practice of delivery of extracorporeal therapies, and the attitude of physicians and nurses. These issues and others are likely to occur in other countries around the world and there is no assurance that we could overcome these challenges or succeed in commercializing the ELAD System or any other product in any foreign country.\nIf we were to pursue foreign commercialization we would face increased risks of doing business due to the extent of our operations internationally.\nIf we were to pursue foreign commercialization, these efforts may be through wholly-owned, foreign domiciled subsidiaries. Our efforts to expand internationally pose risks that could adversely affect our business. These risks include, among others, the effects of:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular non-U.S. economies and markets;\n\u2022\ndiffering and changing regulatory requirements in non-U.S. countries;\n\u2022\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022\nnegative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations, including differing labor relations;\n\u2022\npotential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or comparable foreign laws;\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires;\n\u2022\ncompetitive disadvantages to established foreign businesses with significant current market share and business and customer relationships;\n\u2022\nnationalization;\n\u2022\ntax and regulatory policies of local governments and the possibility of trade embargoes;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, war, terrorism, or other hostilities; and\n\u2022\nlaws and policies of the U.S. and foreign governments affecting foreign trade and investment.\nAny of these risks could cause significant interruptions in potential future operations, which would adversely affect our ability to commercialize products internationally and our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nRevenues, profits and cash flows derived in foreign countries by foreign subsidiaries may be denominated in foreign currency. The value of this currency may be controlled or adjusted periodically by foreign governments, and may be subject to changes in political and economic conditions.\nForeign economic, political and social conditions and government policies could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIf we were to pursue foreign commercialization, a significant portion of our potential future operations may be conducted in foreign countries and it is possible that a significant percentage of our revenues may be derived from these countries. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be subject, to a significant degree, to economic, political, legal and social developments around the world. The economies of many of these countries differ from the economy of the U.S. in many respects, including:\n\u2022\nlevel of government involvement;\n\u2022\neconomic structure;\n\u2022\nallocation of resources;\n\u2022\nlevel of development;\n\u2022\ninflation rates;\n\u2022\ngrowth rate; and\n\u2022\ncontrol of foreign exchange.\nThe legal systems in many foreign countries have inherent uncertainties that could limit the legal protections available to us.\nWe are subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governments, including those applicable to foreign investment and, in particular, laws applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises. Any litigation in these countries may be protracted and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. For example, in 2007, one of our clinical sites in China was sued in connection with the death of a subject of our clinical trial. An expert panel concluded that neither the ELAD System nor the clinical site was at fault and dismissed the lawsuit. Nevertheless, we were later informed that the subject\u2019s family had been awarded approximately $100,000 in a subsequent civil proceeding brought against the clinical site. We ultimately decided to reimburse the clinical site for $100,000, which was partially insured. In addition, these countries may enact new laws or amend current laws that may be detrimental to us, which may have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nWe have limited business insurance coverage internationally.\nThe insurance industry in many parts of the world is still in an early stage of development. Insurance companies in many countries offer only limited business insurance options. As a result, we may not be able to maintain any liability, hazard or other insurance covering our services, business, operations, errors, acts or omissions, personnel or properties in all of the countries in which we have operations. To the extent that we are unable to recover from others for any uninsured losses, such losses could result in a loss of capital and significant harm to our business. If any action, suit, or proceeding is brought against us and we are unable to pay a judgment rendered against us or defend ourselves against such action, suit, or proceeding, our business, financial condition and operations could be negatively affected.\nWe must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Other countries, such as the UK and China, have similar laws with which we must comply. Although we attempt to rigidly adhere to the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all similar laws to which we are subject, there remains the risk that an employee or agent of ours could be accused of violating one or more of these laws, particularly in geographic regions where significant overlap exists between local government and healthcare industries. Such an accusation, even if unwarranted, could prove disruptive to our developmental and commercialization efforts if such efforts are resumed.\nWe could be subject to additional income and other tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and may be subject to income and other taxes in various other foreign jurisdictions. Significant planning is required in evaluating a worldwide provision for income and other taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there may be transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may be subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other tax against us. Although we may believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s impending departure from the European Union could adversely affect our business.\nThe United Kingdom held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the European Union, or Brexit. Negotiations are continuing to determine the future terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union, including, among other things, the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union as well as other world trading partners. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the sterling and euro. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate, including laws that could impact any potential future clinical trials and our ability to obtain approval of our products or sell our products in the United Kingdom. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur patent rights may prove to be an inadequate barrier to competition.\nWe hold a patent in the U.S. which claims a method of using C3A cells to treat a patient\u2019s blood, which we believe covers the ELAD System therapy. In addition, we hold another U.S. patent with claims covering an extracorporeal device configuration, which we believe includes our ELAD System, independent of the cell-type used. Foreign counterparts of these patents have been issued and remain under review in certain jurisdictions. In addition to these two U.S. patents, we hold one additional patent in the U.S. However, the lifespan of any one patent is limited and each of these patents will ultimately expire, and we cannot be sure that pending applications will be granted, or that we will discover new inventions which we can successfully patent. Moreover, any of our granted patents may be held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, and any of these patents may also be construed narrowly by a court of competent jurisdiction in such a way that it is held to not directly cover the entire ELAD System or treatment. Furthermore, even if our patents are held to be valid and of broadly enforceable scope, third parties may find legitimate ways to compete with the ELAD System by inventing around our patents to avoid claims of patent infringement. Finally, the process of obtaining new patents is lengthy and expensive, as is the process for enforcing patent rights against an alleged infringer. Any such litigation could take years, cost large sums of money and pose a significant distraction to management. Indeed, certain jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and Europe have a history of inconsistent, relatively lax or ineffective enforcement of patent rights. In such jurisdictions, even a valid patent may have limited value. Our failure to effectively enforce our patents would likely have a harmful impact on our ability to potentially commercialize the ELAD System in these jurisdictions.\nWe do not hold any patents covering our VTL C3A cells or the production processes we used to grow the VTL C3A cells in the ELAD cartridges.\nC3A cells are publicly available and the proprietary methods and production process that we use to grow our VTL C3A cells in the ELAD cartridges are our trade secrets, but they are not currently covered by a patent and no patents are pending. Although we have sought patent protection for certain aspects of our technology, such as our method of using human liver-derived C3A cells to treat a patient\u2019s blood, and we have obtained orphan designation in the U.S. and Europe for the use of C3A cells to treat acute liver failure, we have not sought patent protection for the proprietary methods we use to grow VTL C3A cells. Although we believe that some of these methods may be patentable, we prefer to avoid the disclosure requirements inherent in the patenting process, as such disclosure could provide competitors with insights that allow them to invent around any granted patents. We believe that this concern is particularly appropriate since C3A cells are publicly available, and have been available for research purposes for more than twenty years. Despite this availability, we are not aware of any third parties who have either demonstrated an ability to grow C3A cells in the quantities we do, or have succeeded in treating a human subject with such cells. In addition, patent protection expires 20 years after the application\u2019s priority date which does not apply to trade secret protection. In light of the foregoing, we do not currently contemplate seeking patent protection for our production methods and instead intend to keep our production methods protected as trade secrets, which does not require us to publicly disclose these methods and which is not subject to a formal expiration date. However, trade secrets are vulnerable to inadvertent disclosure and misappropriation. In addition, independent discovery and publication of these methods by third parties, which is feasible given the public availability of C3A cells, would also destroy their trade secret protection. If any of these were to occur, our business may be harmed.\nWe protect much of our intellectual property as trade secrets. Confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nTrade secrets offer a relatively limited form of protection as they do not create any barrier for third-parties who independently develop this information and who may even patent the information. In the course of our research and development activities and our business activities, we often rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary information. Such confidentiality agreements may be used, for example, when we talk to vendors of laboratory or clinical development services or potential strategic partners. In addition, each of our employees is required to sign a confidentiality agreement upon joining us. We take steps to protect our proprietary information, and our confidentiality agreements are carefully drafted to protect our proprietary interests. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that an employee or an outside party will not make an unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary confidential information. This might happen intentionally or inadvertently. It is possible that a competitor will make use of such information, and that our competitive position will be compromised, in spite of any legal action we might take against persons making such unauthorized disclosures. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the U.S. sometimes are less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, which would harm our business.\nIf our ELAD cartridges or our VTL C3A cells are stolen, misappropriated or reverse engineered, others could produce competing products.\nThird parties, including those previously involved in, or that may in the future be involved in, shipping our ELAD System cartridges or in any manufacturing abroad that we may undertake, often have custody or control of our ELAD cartridges. If our ELAD cartridges, or VTL C3A cells from our proprietary VTL C3A cell bank that are stored to grow in these cartridges, were stolen, misappropriated or reverse engineered, they could be used by other parties who may be able to reproduce these cartridges for their own commercial gain. If this were to occur, it would be difficult for us to challenge this type of use, especially in countries with limited intellectual property protection or in countries in which we do not have patents covering the misappropriated ELAD cartridges. In such instance, our business would be harmed.\nOwnership of our intellectual property may be claimed by others.\nThe ELAD System has been under development for over 20 years and certain of our predecessor companies have filed for reorganization and bankruptcy. We were founded in 2003 by acquisition of the assets of a prior company after a bankruptcy. While we believe we have performed extensive diligence on the ownership of the intellectual property rights and have developed our own innovative technology which is independent of prior intellectual property rights, there could be claims by parties associated with the prior entities that could lead to costly and time consuming legal actions. In addition, we have engaged in collaborations with third parties where intellectual property has been developed. In one instance, we were engaged in a dispute over the ownership of intellectual property when a collaborator of ours pursued patent rights over technology which we believe we may have held rights to under the collaboration agreement. Although a patent which claims a different configuration than our ELAD System was ultimately issued in the U.S. to our former collaborator, we do not hold any rights to this patent. Other such disputes could arise in the future or emerge from past activities which could lead others to claim our intellectual property.\nWe may be involved in future costly intellectual property litigation, which could impact our future business and financial performance.\nOur industry has been characterized by frequent intellectual property litigation. Our competitors or other patent holders may assert that our ELAD System and the methods we employ are covered by their patents. For instance, we are aware of other patents issued in the liver support field which we believe do not cover our ELAD System or its use. If our ELAD System or methods are found to infringe any valid patents, we could be prevented from marketing our ELAD System, if our efforts to develop ELAD are resumed. In addition, we do not know whether our competitors or potential competitors have applied for, or will apply for or obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, sell, import or export our ELAD System.\nLitigation related to infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable, can be expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. If we lose this kind of litigation, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, and prohibit us from using technologies essential to our ELAD System, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not know whether necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, or whether we could redesign our ELAD System or processes to avoid infringement.\nCompeting products may also appear in other countries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit, we could be prevented from marketing our ELAD System in one or more countries, if efforts to develop ELAD are resumed.\nIn addition, we may hereafter become involved in litigation to protect our trademark rights associated with our company name or the names used with our ELAD System. Names used with our ELAD System and procedures may be claimed to infringe names held by others or to be ineligible for proprietary protection. If we have to change the name of our company or our ELAD System, we may experience a loss in goodwill associated with our brand name, customer confusion and a loss of sales, if any.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets owned by third parties.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other life science companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel could hamper our ability to resume the development and commercialization of the ELAD System in the future. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Requirements and Finances\nWe have limited resources to fund our operations and may need to raise additional capital in conjunction with and as a result of our pursuit of strategic alternatives.\nWe have a history of incurring losses and negative cash flows from operations and have an accumulated deficit of $337.4 million through December 31, 2018. Based on our current employees, our known commitments, and our ongoing administrative costs to explore and pursue strategic options, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of $13.3 million as of December 31, 2018 should be sufficient to meet our known liabilities and commitments as of December 31, 2018. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including, but not limited to, whether and when the Transaction closes, future research and development efforts if any, other strategic options that we may pursue, and any unforeseen cash needs which may deplete current cash and cash equivalents sooner than planned.\nAs a result of our liquidity needs, vendors and other key contract counterparties may be reluctant to enter into contracts with us if they believe we may not be able to satisfy our obligations. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding when and if needed on acceptable terms or at all. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we would be required to make further reductions in certain spending to extend current funds, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets, delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate some or all of any development programs or even close our operations. We may also have to delay development of any potential products or license to third parties the rights to our products or technology that we would otherwise seek to develop. Our inability to enter into such contracts or raise additional funding would adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of our decision to cease development of the ELAD System in the United States and Europe, our history of operating losses and the other factors discussed above, we believe there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTo conserve capital, we may undertake additional workforce and cost reduction activities in the future. These activities may cause us to be unable to fully support and manage our operations.\nIn September 2015, and again in September 2018, we instituted across the board expense reductions to conserve capital, and we may, in the future, need to undertake additional workforce reductions or restructuring activities. As a result of the reduction in our workforce, we face an increased risk of employment litigation. We also need to effectively manage our operations and facilities. Following our recent workforce reduction in September 2018, it is possible that our infrastructure may be inadequate to support our future efforts and business strategy or to maintain operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. If we cannot successfully manage our operations, we may be unsuccessful in executing our business strategy, including potential strategic options, including the Transaction.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain, and we may need to raise additional funds in the future.\nWe may need to raise substantial additional capital to:\n\u2022\npursue strategic options for the company;\n\u2022\ncomplete any potential future clinical trials and related regulatory applications;\n\u2022\nfund our operations;\n\u2022\ncommence and expand the commercialization of any products we may acquire; and\n\u2022\nfurther our research and development.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe cost, timing and structure of any potential strategic options that we pursue;\n\u2022\nthe cost of any future research and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of any further clinical development activities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications;\n\u2022\nthe cost of defending litigation or any claims that we infringe third-party patents or violate other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of regulatory clearances or approvals, if any;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of establishing additional technical support capabilities;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of any products;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, although we currently have no significant commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions other than the Transaction.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or additional equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, which we have no prior experience in, it may be necessary to relinquish rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise adequate funds, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets, delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of any potential future development programs or close our operations.\nIf we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to delay development of any potential products or license to third parties the rights to develop our products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations. Any of these factors could harm our operating results.\nRaising additional funds through debt or equity financing is likely to be challenging, could be highly dilutive and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of those securities could result in substantial dilution for our current stockholders and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders. Furthermore, the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline further and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings. The failure of the VTI-208 and VTL-308 clinical trials to meet their primary or secondary endpoints, in addition to general market conditions, may make it very difficult for us to seek and obtain further financing from the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn order to raise required funds we may choose to enter into one or more collaborations. Such collaborations could require us to give up substantial rights to the ELAD System in the U.S. and/or outside the U.S.\nWe may choose to enter into one or more collaborations in order to resume the development of the ELAD System. These collaborations could require us to relinquish substantial rights, potentially including the grant of an exclusive license to make, use and sell the ELAD System, to another company.\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company\nOur common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Global Market if we are unable to maintain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards.\nThe Nasdaq Global Market imposes certain continued listing standards including minimum bid and public float requirements. On October 25, 2018, we received a letter from Nasdaq providing notification that, for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for our common stock was below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement, or the Bid Price Requirement, for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. The notification had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock. In accordance with Nasdaq listing rules, we were afforded 180 calendar days, or until April 23, 2019, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. If we are unable to regain compliance, Nasdaq may determine to delist our common stock. If our common stock is delisted, this would, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds to sustain our operations and could result in the loss of institutional investor interest, limit our strategic alternatives including the Transaction, and result in fewer development opportunities.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increases demand on our systems and resources, and even more so after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight are required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. To assist us in complying with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from development activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and financial statements in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote to approve executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until as late as December 31, 2019 (the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering).\nAs a public company it is more expensive for us to maintain and obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors may also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nUnder Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail our company of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nAs a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. If we do not maintain a proper and effective system of internal control over financial reporting, or if these internal controls are determined not to be designed or operating effectively, it may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the 2018 fiscal year. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe have and will continue to evaluate and test our system of internal control over financial reporting. If, during the evaluation and testing process, we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. This could cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we are no longer an emerging growth company pursuant to the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied that our internal controls over financial reporting are designed and operating effectively to prevent or detect a material misstatement to the financial statements.\nIf we do not remediate any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nIn prior years, we had not maintained an effective control environment to ensure that the design and execution of our controls consistently resulted in effective review of our financial statements and supervision by appropriate individuals. As a result of these factors, certain misstatements in our annual financial statements for periods prior to becoming a public company were identified and brought to the attention of management by our independent registered public accounting firm for correction. We and our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that these control deficiencies constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, that indicates there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim condensed consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nEfforts to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness discussed above were completed. However, the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, may not be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses. In addition, an independent registered public accounting firm has not performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because no such evaluation has been required. Had our independent registered public accounting firm performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses may have been identified. If we are unable to successfully remediate any significant deficiency or material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or identify any additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that may exist, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline as a result.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We are not currently aware of any securities or research analysts that are covering our business. We do not have any control of the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports or whether any such analysts will continue to, or whether new analysts will, cover us for any given period of time. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If a research analyst ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. Since our initial public offering in April 2014 at a price of $12.00 per share, the sale price of stock as reported on the The Nasdaq Global Market has ranged from $0.15 to $35.20, through February 28, 2019. Our announcement in 2015 that the VTI-208 clinical trial failed to meet its primary or secondary endpoints resulted in a significant decline in the market price of our common stock. Then again in September 2018, our announcement that the VTL-308 clinical trial failed to meet its primary or secondary endpoints resulted in a significant decline in the market price of our common stock. Following the announcement on the morning of September 12, 2018 that our VTL-308 clinical trial failed to meet its primary or secondary endpoints, the price of our common stock dropped $5.85 per share, or 93%, from $6.30 per share as of the close of business on September 11, 2018 to $0.45 per share as of the close of business on September 12, 2018. The closing price of our common stock was $0.24 on February 28, 2019. In addition, as with any public company, some investors hold a short position in our common stock. Such investors have published and distributed information about our company including on past and recent clinical trials. Activities by these investors may increase the volatility of the market price of our common stock, and may affect our ability to raise additional funds and to complete any potential future clinical trials or transactions.\nOur stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations due to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nany potential strategic options that we pursue, including the Transaction;\n\u2022\nclinical data and government approvals relating to products in development;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals or applications;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments with respect to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims or other litigation, including intellectual property or securities litigation;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers and directors;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet investors' expectations regarding our future operating performance;\n\u2022\nmedia exposure of our products or products of our competitors;\n\u2022\nvolume and timing of sales of products;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our industry; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nIn addition, an active and liquid market may not develop or persist, and you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at a price that is higher than what you paid for them. These and other factors may make the price of our stock volatile and subject to unexpected fluctuations.\nSale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders or by us may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nIn May 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, or the 2018 Shelf Registration Statement, which became effective in June 2018. The 2018 Shelf Registration Statement permits: (i) the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $200.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, and/or units in one or more offerings and in any combination; (ii) sales of up to 2.5 million shares of common stock by certain selling stockholders; and (iii) the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $60.0 million of our common stock that may be issued and sold under an \u201cat-the-market\u201d sales agreement, or ATM, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. At December 31, 2018, $200.0 million remains available for issuance and sale under the 2018 Shelf Registration Statement, $60.0 million of which may be offered, issued and sold under the ATM. However, we expect the amounts available under the shelf registration statement to be significantly limited to the extent our public float remains below $75.0 million, and our ability to use the ATM will likewise be limited or completely unavailable based on the requirements of the ATM. Additionally, funding is expected to be more difficult to secure due to our VTL-308 clinical trial not meeting its primary or secondary endpoints.\nIn addition, we have filed registration statements on Form S-8 registering a total of 9,634,695 shares of common stock subject to options or reserved for future issuance under our 2012 Stock Option Plan, 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and 2017 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan. Shares registered under these registration statements are available for sale in the public market subject to vesting arrangements, the exercise of such options and, in the case of our affiliates, the restrictions of Rule 144. As of December 31, 2018, options to purchase 6,183,266 shares of our common stock were exercisable.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital by selling and issuing common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, it may result in material dilution to our existing stockholders and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. Sales by us or by our current stockholders also could cause the price of our common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws as well as Delaware law, could discourage a takeover.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law, contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover, and might make it more difficult for an investor to acquire a substantial block of our common stock. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by our stockholders, up to 20,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by a supermajority (75%) vote of our directors then in office;\n\u2022\nspecify that our board of directors may amend or repeal our bylaws only pursuant to a supermajority (75%) vote of our directors then in office;\n\u2022\nspecify that our stockholders may amend or repeal our bylaws only pursuant to a supermajority (75% and majority of the minority, if applicable) vote of the outstanding shares of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nrequire in general the approval of a supermajority (75% and majority of the minority, if applicable) vote of our outstanding shares of capital stock to amend or repeal certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of a supermajority (75% and majority of the minority, if applicable) vote of our outstanding shares of capital stock to approve the sale or liquidation of the company;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may be removed only for cause by a supermajority (75%) vote of our outstanding shares of capital stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nprovide that in general the number of directors on our board may only be fixed from time to time by a supermajority (75%) vote of our directors then in office; and\n\u2022\nestablish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving staggered terms;\nThese provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management. The existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock and unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisitions. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect or remove directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a positive return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.", "PERMNO": 14615, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "IMUX"}
