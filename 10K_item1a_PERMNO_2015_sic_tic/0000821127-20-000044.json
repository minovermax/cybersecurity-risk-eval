{"cik": "821127", "company": "BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nBefore deciding to invest in us or deciding to maintain or increase your investment, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nOur strategic plan and growth strategy may not be as successful as we project or expect.\nWe have adopted and are in the early stages of implementing a three-year strategy to increase our revenue by growing our wealth management platform, deposit base and commercial loan portfolio, while at the same time lowering our efficiency ratio and engaging in a complete digital and operational platform redesign. The successful implementation of the strategic plan will require, among other things, that we focus on organic growth as well as acquisitions. We believe that we have established a strong platform to support future growth, but there is no guarantee that our strategic plan or other initiatives that we may pursue will be as productive or effective as we expect, or at all.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees.\nOur success depends on the talent and ability of our employees. Competition for the best people can be intense, and we may not be able to hire or retain the employees that we depend upon for success, or the employees that we do hire may be restricted for a period of time in the activities that they may perform for us as a result of agreements with their previous employers. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key employees could jeopardize our relationships with our clients and lead to the loss of client accounts and relationships, causing an adverse impact on our business. This loss could further lead to a loss in employee skills and institutional knowledge. Frequently, we compete in the market for talent with entities that are not subject to comprehensive regulation, including with respect to the structure of incentive compensation. Our inability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees could adversely impact our business.\nIf we acquire or seek to acquire other companies in the future, our business may be negatively impacted by certain risks inherent in such acquisitions.\nWe continue to consider the acquisition of other private banking and wealth management and trust companies, as well as companies with other potential capabilities in the financial services industry. To the extent that we acquire or seek to acquire other companies in the future, our business may be negatively impacted by certain risks inherent in such acquisitions. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022we may incur substantial expenses in pursuing potential acquisitions, which may negatively impact our results, whether or not the acquisition is completed;\n\u2022management may divert its attention from other aspects of our business;\n\u2022an acquired business may not perform in accordance with our expectations, including because we may lose key clients or employees of the acquired business as a result of the change in ownership;\n\u2022difficulties may arise in connection with the integration of the operations of the acquired business with our existing businesses;\n\u2022we may need to make significant investments in infrastructure, controls, staff, emergency backup facilities or other critical business functions that become strained by our growth;\n\u2022we may assume potential and unknown liabilities of the acquired company as a result of an acquisition; and\n\u2022an acquisition may dilute our earnings per share, in both the short and long-term, or it may reduce our regulatory and tangible capital ratios.\nAs a result of these risks, any given acquisition, if and when consummated, may adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, because the consideration for an acquisition may involve cash, debt or the\nissuance of shares of our stock and may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, existing shareholders may experience dilution in connection with any acquisition.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we fail to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies in addition to remote connectivity solutions. We might not be successful in developing or introducing new products and services, integrating new products or services into our existing offerings, responding or adapting to changes in consumer behavior, preferences, spending, investing and/or saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers.\nWe face significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment that includes financial and non-financial services firms, including traditional banks, digital banks, financial technology companies and others. These companies compete on the basis of, among other factors, size, location, quality and type of products and services offered, price, technology, brand recognition and reputation. Emerging technologies have the potential to further intensify competition and accelerate disruption in the financial services industry. In recent years, non-financial services firms, such as financial technology companies, have begun to offer services traditionally provided by financial institutions. These firms attempt to use technology and mobile platforms to enhance the ability of companies and individuals to borrow, save and invest money. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives; to develop competitive products and technologies; and to attract, retain and develop a highly skilled employee workforce. If we are not able to compete successfully, we could be placed at a competitive disadvantage, which could result in the loss of customers and market share, and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur ability to attract and retain clients and employees, and to maintain relationships with vendors, third-party service providers and others, could be adversely affected if our reputation is harmed.\nWe are dependent on our reputation within our market areas, as a trusted and responsible financial services company, for all aspects of our relationships with clients, employees, vendors, third-party service providers, and others with whom we conduct business or potential future business. Our ability to maintain these relationships could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation is damaged. Our actual or perceived failure to address various issues could give rise to reputational risk that could cause harm to us and our business prospects. These issues include, but are not limited to, legal and regulatory requirements; privacy; cybersecurity; properly maintaining client and employee personal information; record keeping; money-laundering; sales and trading practices; ethical issues; appropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest; and the proper identification and disclosure of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity, and market risks inherent in our products and services. Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions, reputational harm, and legal risks, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines, and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses. In addition, our businesses are dependent on the integrity of our employees. If an employee were to misappropriate any client funds or client information, our reputation could be negatively affected, which may result in the loss of accounts and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance, and legal reporting systems; internal controls; management review processes; and other mechanisms. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and may not anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement future information technology system enhancements, which could adversely affect our business operations and profitability.\nWe invest significant resources in information technology system enhancements in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level. We may not be able to successfully implement and integrate future system enhancements, which could adversely impact the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and result in possible sanctions from regulatory authorities. Such sanctions could include fines and\nsuspension of trading in our stock, among others. In addition, future system enhancements could have higher than expected costs, fail to achieve their intended operating efficiencies, and/or even result in operating inefficiencies, which could increase the costs associated with their implementation as well as ongoing operations.\nFailure to properly utilize implemented system enhancements in the future could result in write offs that could adversely impact our results of operations, and financial condition and could result in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components. In addition, we may incur significant training, licensing, maintenance, consulting and depreciation expenses during and after systems implementations, and any such costs may continue for an extended period of time.\nWe face continuing and growing security risks to our information base, including the information we maintain relating to our customers.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our business and to store sensitive data, including our confidential information and financial and personal information regarding customers. Our electronic communications and information systems infrastructure could be susceptible to cyberattacks, hacking, identity theft, computer viruses, malicious code, ransomware, phishing attacks, terrorist activity or other information security breaches. This risk has increased significantly due to the use of online, telephonic and mobile channels by clients and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. We have implemented, and regularly review and update, extensive systems of internal controls and procedures as well as corporate governance policies and procedures intended to protect our business operations, including the security and privacy of all confidential customer information. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. No matter how well designed or implemented the controls are, we cannot provide an absolute guarantee to protect our business operations from every type of problem in every situation. A failure or circumvention of these controls could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe regularly assess and test our security systems and disaster preparedness, including back-up systems, but the risks are substantially escalating. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued enhancement of our controls and processes to protect our systems, data and networks from attacks, unauthorized access or significant damage remain a priority. Accordingly, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or exposures. Any breach of our system security could result in disruption of our operations, unauthorized access to confidential customer information, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, significant regulatory and remediation costs, litigation exposure and other possible damages, loss or liability. Such costs or losses could exceed the amount of our available insurance coverage, if any, and could adversely affect our earnings. Also, any failure to prevent a security breach or to quickly and effectively deal with such a breach could negatively impact customer confidence, damaging our reputation and undermining our ability to attract and keep customers.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, using established criteria and complying with applicable regulatory guidance to evaluate each vendor\u2019s overall risk profile, capabilities, financial stability, and internal control environment, we do not control their daily business environment and actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, impair our ability to conduct our business efficiently and effectively, and/or result in regulatory action, financial loss, litigation, and loss of reputation. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nOur business is highly regulated, and changes in the laws and regulations that apply to us could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting us, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies; maintenance of adequate capital and the financial condition of a financial institution; permissible types, amounts and terms of extensions of credit and investments; permissible non-banking activities; the level of reserves against deposits; and restrictions on dividend payments. The Federal Reserve and the Commissioner have the power to issue cease and desist orders to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulation, and the Federal Reserve possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies. These and other restrictions limit the manner in which we and the Bank may conduct business and obtain financing. In addition, our RIAs are subject to regulation under the Advisors Act, federal and state securities laws and fiduciary laws. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on RIAs, including fiduciary, record keeping, operational and disclosure obligations.\nThe laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. These changes could adversely impact us. Such changes could, among other things, subject us to additional costs, including costs of compliance; limit the types of financial services and products we may offer; and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies, or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter or registration as an investment adviser, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See Part I. Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and any failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose community investment and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act or other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operation, and financial condition.\nWe may become subject to enforcement actions even though noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional.\nThe financial services industry faces intense and ongoing scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels, particularly with respect to compliance with anti-money laundering, BSA and OFAC regulations, and economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and nationals. Enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance in place at the time. Failure to comply with these and other regulations, and supervisory expectations related thereto, may result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputational damage, or restrictions on our business.\nWe face significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against us.\nFrom time to time we are named as a defendant or are otherwise involved in various regulatory investigations and legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. There is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future. Future actions against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, or cause serious reputational harm to us. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we could experience a high level of litigation related to our businesses and operations.\nClimate change, severe weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other external events could harm our business.\nNatural disasters, including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change, can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the economies in which we operate, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, and financial condition. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood, could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, or pandemics could cause disruptions to our business or the economy as a whole. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by changes in economic and market conditions.\nA worsening of economic and market conditions, downside shocks, or a return to recessionary economic conditions could result in adverse effects on us and others in the financial services industry.\nOur Private Banking segment primarily serves individuals and smaller businesses located in three geographic regions: New England, Northern California, and Southern California. The ability of our clients to repay their loans is impacted by the economic conditions in these areas. The Bank\u2019s commercial loans, with limited exceptions, are secured by real estate, marketable securities, or corporate assets. Substantially all of the Bank\u2019s residential mortgage and home equity loans are secured by residential property. Consequently, the Bank\u2019s ability to continue to originate real estate loans may be impaired by the weakening or deterioration in local and regional economic conditions in the real estate markets, including as a result of, among other things, natural disasters. A borrower\u2019s default on its obligations under one or more Bank loans may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and external resources to the collection and workout of the loan. Where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable workout arrangements cannot be reached, the Bank may have to charge off the loan in whole or in part, and the Bank may acquire the real estate or other assets, if any, that secure the loan. The amount owed under the defaulted loan may exceed the value of the assets acquired.\nOur Wealth Management and Trust segment may be negatively impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions because the performance of such businesses is directly affected by conditions in the financial and securities markets. The financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry are highly volatile (meaning that performance results can vary greatly within short periods of time) and are directly affected by, among other factors, domestic and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance, all of which are beyond our control. Declines in the financial markets or a lack of sustained growth may adversely affect the market value of the assets that we manage. In addition, our management contracts generally provide for fees payable for services based on the market value of assets under management, although there are a portion of our contracts that provide for the payment of fees based on investment performance in addition to a base fee. Because most contracts provide for a fee based on market values of securities, fluctuations in the underlying securities values may have an adverse effect on fees and therefore our results of operations, and financial condition.\nPrepayments of loans may negatively impact our banking business.\nGenerally, the Bank\u2019s clients may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The rate at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within our clients\u2019 discretion. Fluctuations in interest rates, in certain circumstances, may also lead to high levels of loan prepayments, which may also have an adverse impact on our net interest income. If clients prepay the principal amount of their loans, and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, our interest income will be reduced. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on our results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different financial institutions, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, other commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other financial institutions. As a result, defaults by, or even negative rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and organizations. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur cost of funds for banking operations may increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures.\nThe Bank has traditionally obtained funds principally through deposits and borrowings. As a general matter, deposits are a cheaper source of funds than borrowings, because interest rates paid for deposits are typically less than interest rates charged for borrowings. We compete with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. If, as a result of general economic conditions, market interest rates, competitive pressures, or otherwise, the amount of deposits at the Bank decreases relative to its overall banking operations, the Bank may have to rely more heavily on higher cost borrowings as a source of funds in the future or otherwise reduce its loan growth or pursue loan sales. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin, net interest income, and net income.\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact our banking business.\nThe Bank\u2019s earnings and financial condition are largely dependent on net interest income, which represents the difference between the interest income earned on interest-bearing assets (usually loans and investment securities) and the\ninterest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings). The relative rates of interest we earn and pay are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, and changes in monetary or fiscal policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental authorities. A narrowing of this interest rate spread and the shape of the yield curve could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s net interest income, which also could negatively impact its earnings and financial condition. As a result, the Bank has adopted asset and liability management policies to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income, primarily by altering the mix and maturity of loans, investments, funding sources, and derivatives. However, even with these policies in place, a change in interest rates can impact our results of operations, and financial condition.\nAn increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on the Bank\u2019s results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current floating or adjustable rate loan obligations, which could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures, and charge-offs, but also necessitate increases to our allowance for loan losses.\nSimilarly, rising interest rates may increase the cost of deposits, which are a primary source of funding. While we actively manage against these risks through hedging and other risk management strategies, if our assumptions regarding borrower behavior are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than anticipated, our risk mitigation techniques may be insufficient.\nA decrease in interest rates could also have a negative impact on the Bank\u2019s results of operations if clients refinance their loans at lower rates or prepay their loans and we are unable to lend or invest those funds at equivalent or higher rates.\nPotential downgrades of U.S. government securities by one or more of the credit ratings agencies could have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings and financial condition.\nA possible future downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and a decline in the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by these affected instruments held by us, as well as affect the pricing of that funding when it is available. A downgrade may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments held by us. We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. Such ratings actions could result in a significant adverse impact on us. Among other things, a downgrade in the U.S. government\u2019s credit rating could adversely impact the value of our securities portfolio and may trigger requirements that the Company post additional collateral for trades relative to these securities. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related institutions, agencies or instruments would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which we are subject and any related adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and an increase in the allowance for loan losses will adversely affect our earnings.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses based on available information, including the quality of our loan portfolio, certain economic conditions, the historical rate of defaulted loans, the value of the underlying collateral, and the level of our nonaccruing and criticized loans. We rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the level required for the allowance for loan losses. If we determine that further increases in the allowance for loan losses are necessary, the increase will adversely affect our earnings. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses, and may require us to adjust the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. These adjustments could negatively impact our results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe accounting rules related to the calculation of the allowance for loan losses changed effective January 1, 2020. The prospective application of the new rules could significantly change the amount of future provision for loan loss expenses as compared to the previous rules. The change in the allowance for loan losses at the time of adoption, consistent with what is known, could result in an increase to retained earnings based on the new rules. For further information, see Part II. Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, and construction and land loans, which are generally riskier than other types of loans.\nAt December 31, 2019, our commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, and construction and land loans portfolios comprised 56% of total loans. These types of commercial loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a higher risk of nonpayment or late payment than residential mortgage loans. These loans may lack standardized terms and may include a significant principal balance or \u201cballoon\u201d payment due on maturity. The ability of a borrower to make or refinance a balloon payment may be affected by a number of factors, including the financial condition of the borrower, prevailing economic\nconditions, interest rates, and collateral values. Repayment of these loans is generally more dependent on the economy and the successful operation of the underlying business. Because of the risks associated with commercial loans, we may experience higher rates of default than if our loan portfolio were more heavily weighted toward residential mortgage loans. Higher rates of default could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, and financial condition.\nEnvironmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, the Bank may acquire, through foreclosure or other similar proceedings, properties securing loans it has originated or purchased which are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that material environmental violations could be discovered at these properties. In this event, we or the Bank might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of this remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties as a result of their condition. These events could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in some circumstances, which could harm liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including government-sponsored entities, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates, which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining loan loss reserves, reserves related to litigation, if any, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material fluctuations in our results of operations. For additional information, see Part II. Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d\nChanges in accounting standards can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or \u201cFASB,\u201d changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to anticipate and difficult and costly to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our results of operations, and financial condition. In some cases, we could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results. For example, in June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"ASU 2016-13\") that, effective January 1, 2020, substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions, and other organizations. The standard removed the existing \u201cprobable\u201d threshold in GAAP for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial assets. Companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The ongoing impact to earnings is expected to be more volatile and could adversely impact our reported earnings and lending activity.\nGoodwill and other intangible asset impairment would negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGenerally, the acquirer in a business combination is willing to pay more for a business than the sum of the fair values of the individual assets and liabilities because of other inherent value associated with an assembled business. The resulting excess of the consideration paid over the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition, is recognized as goodwill. An essential part of the acquisition method of accounting is the recognition and measurement of identifiable intangible assets, separate from goodwill, at fair value. At December 31, 2019, our goodwill and net intangible assets totaled $68.0 million.\nUnder current accounting standards, goodwill acquired in a business combination is recognized as an asset and not amortized. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there is a triggering event that may indicate the possibility of impairment. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable.\nIf we determine goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to write-down the value of these assets. We have had to take such impairment charges in the past, and we cannot assure you that we will not be required to take further impairment charges in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on our results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges in tax law and differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, local, state or federal tax authorities change tax laws and regulations, which may result in a decrease or increase to our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2019, our net deferred tax assets were $11.4 million. We assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realizable based primarily on future taxable income and, if necessary, establish a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets determined to not likely be realizable. Management judgment is required in determining the appropriate recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including projections of future taxable income, as well as the character of that income.\nLocal, state or federal tax authorities may interpret tax laws and regulations differently than we do and challenge tax positions that we have taken on tax returns. This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest or penalties that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends.\nWe are a legal entity that is separate and distinct from the Bank and DGHM, and we depend on dividends from the Bank and, to a lesser extent, DGHM, to fund dividend payments on our common stock and payments on our other obligations. Our right, and consequently the right of our shareholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Bank and DGHM through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the Bank (including depositors) and DGHM, except to the extent that certain claims of ours in a creditor capacity may be recognized. A reduction or elimination of dividends could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as, and if declared by our Board of Directors. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so. Our Board of Directors may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. The Federal Reserve has authority to prohibit us and the Bank from paying dividends if such payment, in its opinion, would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, we are required to inform and consult with the Federal Reserve in advance of declaring a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid. See Part I. Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation - Dividend Restrictions\u201d and \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Capital Requirements.\u201d\nWe are subject to liquidity risk, which could negatively affect our funding levels.\nMarket conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences.\nAlthough we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions, a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us. If the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time, our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means. These alternatives may include generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings, borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements, using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors, and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities. These alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions, which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs.\nUncertainty about the future of London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") may adversely affect our business.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the US as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including funding sources, adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which will stop reporting such information after 2021. It is uncertain at this time whether LIBOR will change or cease to exist or the extent to which those entering into financial contracts will transition to any other particular benchmark. Other benchmarks may perform differently than LIBOR or may have other consequences that cannot currently be anticipated. It is also uncertain what will happen with instruments that rely on LIBOR for future interest rate adjustments and which of those instruments may remain outstanding or be renegotiated if LIBOR ceases to exist. The uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR as well as the transition from LIBOR to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on our funding costs or net interest margins, as well as any floating-rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments that currently use LIBOR as a benchmark rate and, ultimately, adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to capital and liquidity standards that require banks and bank holding companies to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.\nWe became subject to new capital requirements in 2015. These new standards, which are now fully phased-in, require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially higher levels of capital as a percentage of their assets, with a greater emphasis on common equity as opposed to other components of capital. The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, may at some point limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to grow our business. It could also result in our being required to take steps to increase our regulatory capital and may dilute shareholder value or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to our investors through stock repurchases.\nFuture capital offerings may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources or, if our or the Bank\u2019s capital ratios fall below required minimums, we or the Bank could be required to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt, common or preferred stock, or senior or subordinated notes. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and any shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock.\nAdditional future equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings.\nWe cannot assure you that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our inability to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022quarterly variations in our operating results or the quality of our assets;\n\u2022operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts, or investors;\n\u2022changes in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022announcements of innovations, new products, strategic developments, significant contracts, litigation, acquisitions, divestitures, reorganizations, restructurings and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u2022our past and future dividend and share repurchase practices;\n\u2022regulatory developments and actions;\n\u2022future sales of our equity or equity-related securities; and\n\u2022changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders.\nProvisions of Massachusetts law, the BHCA, and provisions of our articles of organization and by-laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. Our articles of organization authorize our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval and such preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. These and other provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 80223, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BPFH"}
