{"cik": "8858", "company": "AVNET INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-08-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nForward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors\nThis Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, and actual results and other outcomes could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement is made. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made.\nRisks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include the risk factors discussed below, but may also include risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that management does not currently consider material. Such factors make the Company\u2019s operating results for future periods difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results do not necessarily indicate results in future periods except as disclosed. Some of the risks disclosed below may have already occurred, but not to a degree that management considers material. Any of the below factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, operating results, prospects, and liquidity. Similarly, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions; actual financial results that do not meet the Company\u2019s or the investment community\u2019s expectations; changes in the Company\u2019s or the investment community\u2019s expectations for the Company\u2019s future results, dividends or share repurchases; and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nBusiness and Operations Risks\nChanges in customer needs and consumption models\nChanges in customer product demands and consumption models may cause a decline in the Company\u2019s billings, which would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. While the Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible, the dynamics of the industries in which it operates make it difficult to predict and timely react to such changes, including those relating to product capacity and lead times. Also, future downturns or supply chain challenges in the semiconductor and embedded solutions industries could adversely affect the Company\u2019s relationships with its customers, operating results, and profitability. In addition, the semiconductor industry experiences periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand (often associated with changes in economic conditions, technology, and manufacturing capacity) and suppliers may not adequately predict or meet customer demand. During fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, sales of semiconductors represented approximately 75%, 76%, and 77% of the Company\u2019s consolidated sales, respectively, and the Company\u2019s sales closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor industry. These conditions make it more difficult to manage the Company\u2019s business and predict future performance.\nDue to the Company\u2019s increased online sales, system interruptions and delays that make its websites and services unavailable or slow to respond may reduce the attractiveness of its products and services to its customers. If the Company is unable to continually improve the efficiency of its systems, it could cause systems interruptions or delays and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nDisruptions to key supplier and customer relationships\nOne of the Company\u2019s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes. For fiscal 2021, there were no Company suppliers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s consolidated billings. The Company\u2019s contracts with its suppliers vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. The Company\u2019s suppliers may terminate or significantly reduce their volume of business with the Company, because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with the Company, changes in strategy, or otherwise.\nShortages of products or loss of a supplier may negatively affect the Company\u2019s business and relationships with its customers could be negatively affected, as customers depend on the Company\u2019s timely delivery of technology hardware and software from the industry\u2019s leading suppliers. In addition, shifts in suppliers\u2019 strategies, or performance and delivery issues, may negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial results. These conditions make it more difficult to manage the Company\u2019s business and predict future performance.\nThe termination of the Company\u2019s distribution contract with Texas Instruments (\u201cTI\u201d) (which had been one of the Company\u2019s largest suppliers) was completed in December 2020. Sales from TI products represented approximately 9% and 10% of total sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively. The Company may experience lower sales and gross profits in the future if the impact of this termination is not offset over time by sales growth, gross margin improvements, and operating cost reductions.\nThe competitive landscape has also experienced a consolidation among suppliers and capacity constraints, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability and customer base. Further, if key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts (including, without limitation, terms regarding price protection, rights of return, delivery commitments, rebates, or other terms that protect or enhance the Company\u2019s gross margins), it could negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nRisks related to international operations\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 approximately 78%, 75% and 75%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s sales came from its operations outside the United States. The Company\u2019s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf potential restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;\n\u25cf foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf non-compliance with foreign and domestic data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental regulations, and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines and criminal proceedings;\n\u25cf non-compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations and adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including technology transfer restrictions, additional license, permit or authorization requirements for shipments, specific company sanctions, new and higher duties, tariffs or surcharges, or other import/export controls;\n\u25cf complex and changing tax laws and regulations;\n\u25cf regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions;\n\u25cf economic and political instability, terrorism, and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest;\n\u25cf fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the\ntransportation and shipping infrastructure;\n\u25cf natural disasters, pandemics, and other public health crises;\n\u25cf differing employment practices and labor issues; and\n\u25cf non-compliance with local laws.\nIn addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of import or export regulations and anti-corruption laws, by the Company or its third-party agents, create heightened risks for the Company\u2019s international operations. If a regulatory body determines that the Company has violated such laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs, have its import or export capabilities restricted or denied, or have its inventories seized, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated any such regulations may negatively impact the Company\u2019s reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the Company. While the Company has adopted measures and controls designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.\nTariffs and trade restrictions resulting from international trade disputes or changes in trade policies may adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales and profitability. For example, the U.S. government-imposed trade restrictions and new or higher tariffs on certain imported products. Additionally, several trade policies, rules, and restrictions applicable to China are now applicable to Hong Kong. In kind, the Chinese government has imposed trade restrictions, sanctions, and new or higher tariffs on U.S. imports into China. These actions have resulted in increased costs, including increased costs of procuring certain products the Company purchases from its suppliers, and other related expenses, which may impact the Company\u2019s sales and customer demand for certain products. In addition, increased operational expenses incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating profits. Neither U.S. tariffs nor any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have yet had a material impact, but any future actions or escalations that affect trade relations could materially affect the Company\u2019s sales and results of operations.\nThe Company transacts sales, pays expenses, owns assets, and incurs liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the Company must translate such activities and amounts into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies affect the Company\u2019s reported amounts of sales, operating income, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect the Company\u2019s earnings from those markets. While the Company may use derivative financial instruments to reduce its net exposure, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may materially affect the Company\u2019s financial results. Further, foreign currency instability and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of the Company\u2019s customers and may impair its customers\u2019 ability to repay existing obligations.\nInternal information systems failures\nThe Company depends on its information systems to facilitate its day-to-day operations and to produce timely, accurate, and reliable information on financial and operational results. Currently, the Company\u2019s global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, some of which are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the Company\u2019s systems. These IT projects are extremely complex, in part because of wide ranging processes, multiple legacy systems used, and the Company\u2019s business operations. The Company may not always succeed at these efforts. Implementation or integration difficulties may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to complete business transactions and ensure accurate recording and reporting of financial data. In addition, IT projects may not achieve the\nexpected efficiencies and cost savings, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results. A failure of any of these information systems in a way described above, or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, internal controls, and reporting obligations under federal securities laws.\nLogistics disruptions\nThe Company\u2019s global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers around the globe, some of which are outsourced. The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers to deliver products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as information technology upgrades and operating issues, warehouse modernization and relocation efforts, natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from the Company\u2019s third-party transportation providers) could cause an increase in expenses or a delay in expected cost savings. In addition, as the Company continues to increase capacity at its distribution center in Leeds, England, it may experience operational challenges, increases costs, decreased efficiency, and customer delivery delays and failures. Such operational challenges could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business partners, and on the Company\u2019s business, operations, financial performance, and reputation.\nData security and privacy threats\nThreats to the Company\u2019s data and information technology systems (including phishing, cyber-attacks, and ransomware) are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. Threat actors have successfully breached the Company\u2019s systems in various ways, and such security breaches expose the Company to significant potential liability and reputational harm. Security breaches have not yet materially impacted the Company\u2019s operations, financial condition, or data security and privacy, but future security breaches could have a material impact. Threat actors seek unauthorized access to intellectual property, or confidential or proprietary information regarding the Company, its customers, or its business partners. They deploy malicious software programs that exploit security vulnerabilities, including ransomware designed to encrypt the Company\u2019s files so an attacker may demand a ransom for restored access. They also seek to misdirect money, sabotage data and systems, and induce employees or other system users to disclose sensitive information, including login credentials. Further, the Company\u2019s business partners and service providers, such as hosted solution providers, pose a security risk because their own security systems or infrastructure may be compromised.\nThe Company incurs significant costs to prevent and detect these risks, as well as to respond to security breaches as they occur. However, the Company\u2019s efforts are not fully successful. Threat actors frequently change their techniques and, consequently, the Company does not always promptly detect the existence or scope of a security breach. As these types of threats grow and evolve, the Company may make further investments to protect its data and information technology infrastructure, which may impact the Company\u2019s profitability. The Company\u2019s insurance coverage for protecting against cyber-attacks may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the Company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business. As a global enterprise, the Company may be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices, related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization, and data protection.\nFinancial Risks\nInventory value decline\nThe electronic components and integrated products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs, and changes in industry standards and regulatory requirements, which can cause the Company\u2019s inventory to decline in value or become obsolete. Regardless of the general economic environment, prices may decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products, which may increase the risk\nof declines in inventory value. Many of the Company\u2019s suppliers offer certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), but such policies may not fully compensate for the loss. Also, suppliers may not honor such agreements, some of which are subject to the supplier discretion. In addition, most Company sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, rather than through long-term sales contracts. Where there are contracts, such contracts are generally terminable at will upon notice. Unforeseen customer cancellations may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nAccounts receivable defaults\nAccounts receivable are a significant portion of the Company\u2019s working capital. If entities responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable cease doing business, direct their business elsewhere, fail to pay, or delay payment, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to collect receivables, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs, and defaults exceeding management\u2019s expectations. A significant deterioration in the Company\u2019s ability to collect accounts receivable in the United States could impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program.\nLiquidity and capital resources constraints\nThe Company\u2019s ability to satisfy its cash needs and implement its capital allocation strategy depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing. However, various factors affect external financing, including general market conditions and the Company\u2019s debt ratings and operating results, and may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. An increase in the Company\u2019s debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its debt ratings. Any such reduction could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing financing, and could result in reduced credit limits, increased financing expenses, and additional restrictions and covenants. A reduction in its current debt rating may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s working capital and impair its relationship with its customers and suppliers.\nAs of July 3, 2021, Avnet had debt outstanding with financial institutions under various notes, secured borrowings, and committed and uncommitted lines of credit. The Company needs cash to pay debt principal and interest, and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. Under certain of its credit facilities, the applicable interest rate and costs are based in part on the Company\u2019s current debt rating. If its debt rating is reduced, higher interest rates and increased costs would result. In addition, some of its debt utilizes the LIBOR rate, which the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority intends to phase out by the end of 2021. At this time, it is uncertain how markets will respond to the discontinuation of LIBOR or to the proposed alternative rates, which may result in increased costs and higher interest rates. Any material increase in the Company\u2019s financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective financing could have an adverse effect on its profitability, results of operations, and cash flows.\nUnder some of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and pass certain financial tests. If the Company increases its level of debt or its operating results deteriorate, it may fail to meet these financial ratios or pass these tests, which may result in an event of default. In such an event, lenders may accelerate payment and the Company may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities or is required to repay debt earlier than management expected, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments, to repay indebtedness, or for general corporate needs.\nGeneral economic or business conditions, both domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company\u2019s accounts receivable securitization program.\nFinancing covenants and restrictions may limit management discretion\nThe agreements governing the Company\u2019s financing, including its credit facility, accounts receivable securitization program, and the indentures governing the Company\u2019s outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company\u2019s ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to:\n\u25cf grant liens on assets;\n\u25cf make restricted payments (including, under certain circumstances, paying dividends on common stock, or redeeming or repurchasing common stock);\n\u25cf make certain investments;\n\u25cf merge, consolidate, or transfer all, or substantially all, of the Company\u2019s assets;\n\u25cf incur additional debt; or\n\u25cf engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, repurchase common stock, pay a dividend, compete effectively, or make further investments.\nTax law changes and compliance\nAs a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, governments enact new tax laws or regulations that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s tax positions. Also, changes to current tax laws or regulations, including changes in the interpretation of such laws, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flow and effective tax rate.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, the CARES Act permits net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows net operating losses incurred in fiscal 2019, 2020, and 2021 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable fiscal years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The CARES Act is subject to interpretation and implementation guidance by both federal and state tax authorities, as well as amendments and technical corrections. Any or all of these could impact the Company unfavorably.\nMany countries are adopting provisions to align their international tax rules with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and supported by the United States. The project aims to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including with regard to tax rate increases and adopting a global minimum tax. These provisions, individually or as a whole, may negatively impact taxation of international business.\nThe tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable law, taxing authorities may challenge these tax positions and the Company may not be successful in defending against any such challenges.\nThe Company\u2019s future income tax expense could be favorably or adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, and liabilities and changes to its operating structure.\nConstraints on internal financial controls\nEffective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports, safeguard its assets, and prevent and detect fraud. If the Company cannot do so, its brand and operating results could be harmed. Internal controls over financial reporting are intended to prevent and detect material misstatements in its financial reporting and material fraudulent activity. Internal controls are limited, including limits related to human error, circumventing or overriding controls, and fraud. As a result, the Company may not identify all material activity or all immaterial activity that could aggregate into a material misstatement. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot guarantee that financial statements are wholly accurate or prevent all fraud and loss of assets. Management continually evaluates the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s internal controls. However, if the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved internal controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company\u2019s business and operating results could be harmed. Additionally, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, or the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, all of which could have an adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company\u2019s securities.\nAcquisition expected benefits shortfall\nAvnet has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments globally to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with Avnet\u2019s historical operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, impacting existing customer and supplier relationships, incurring costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired, incurring potential impairment charges on acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, and diverting management\u2019s attention from existing business operations. As a result, the Company\u2019s profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, the Company may not successfully integrate the acquired businesses, or the integration may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than anticipated. Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will increase expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, which may impact the Company\u2019s profitability. The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have an adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing compliance issues or deficiencies, or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nLegal proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings, including government investigations, that arise out of the ordinary conduct of the Company\u2019s business, including matters involving intellectual property rights, commercial matters, merger-related matters, product liability, and other actions. Legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s efforts and other resources, and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and business reputation. The Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services that the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. The\nCompany may not be able to obtain supplier indemnification for itself and its customers against such claims, or such indemnification may not fully protect the Company and its customers against such claims. Also, the Company is exposed to potential liability for technology and products that it develops for which it has no indemnification protections. If an infringement claim against the Company is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively. In addition, the Company\u2019s expanding business activities may include the assembly or manufacture of electronic component products and systems. Product defects, whether caused by a design, assembly, manufacture or component failure or error, or manufacturing processes not in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, may result in product liability claims, product recalls, fines, and penalties. Product liability risks could be particularly significant with respect to aerospace, automotive, and medical applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of such products.\nEnvironmental regulations\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from industrial processes, waste disposal, carbon emissions, use of hazardous materials in products and operations, recycling products, and other related matters. While the Company strives to fully comply with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault. Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs, and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nCOVID-19 impacts on economy, operations, and financial results\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, increased demand uncertainty, created supply chain and forecasting challenges, and disrupted logistics and distribution systems. As a result, this pandemic has negatively impacted the operations of the Company and its customers and suppliers, and resulted in or heightened the risks of customer bankruptcies, customer delayed or defaulted payments, product supply constraints, delays in product deliveries, restrictions on access to financial markets, and other risk factors described in the Company\u2019s Annual Report. While the Company has not yet experienced any material disruption to its upstream supply chain and many of its distribution centers remain operational under business continuity plans, it has experienced increased logistics costs, product demand fluctuations, product pricing challenges, longer lead times, reduction in global distribution center utilization, and shipping delays. As the scope and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and the extent of its economic impact continues to evolve globally, there is significant uncertainty related to the ultimate impact that it will have on the Company\u2019s business, its employees, product supply and demand, results of operations, and financial condition, and to what extent the Company\u2019s actions to mitigate such impacts will be successful and sufficient.\nEconomic and geopolitical uncertainty\nThe Company\u2019s financial results, operations, and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty (including the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and international trade disputes) have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased sales, margins, and earnings. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty may also lead the Company to impair assets (including goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets) and increase restructuring expenses to reduce expenses in\nresponse to decreased sales or margins.\nThe Company may not be able to adequately adjust its cost structure in a timely fashion, which may adversely impact its profitability. Uncertainty about economic conditions may increase foreign currency volatility, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s results. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables, which may result in provisions to create reserves, write-offs, reduced access to liquidity, and higher financing costs.\nFurther, an increase in inflation rates could affect the Company\u2019s profitability and cash flows, due to higher wages, higher operating costs, higher financing costs, and/or higher supplier prices. Inflation may also adversely affect foreign exchange rates. The Company may be unable to pass along such higher costs to its customers. In addition, Inflation may adversely affect customers\u2019 financing costs, cash flows, and profitability, which could adversely impact their operations and the Company\u2019s ability to offer credit and collect receivables.\nThe Company is monitoring the implementation and effects of Brexit and developing contingency plans, including changes to its logistics operations and shipment routes, and preparing for changes in trade facilitation regulations. While the extent of the impact of Brexit is not yet fully known, Brexit has led to instability and uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the European Union, could contribute to logistical and regulatory delays at borders, and volatility in the foreign exchange markets, and may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s trade operations and financial results.\nCompetition\nThe market for the Company\u2019s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, new competitors, non-traditional competitors, changes in industry standards, and changes in customer product demands and consumption models. The Company competes with other global and regional distributors, as well as some of the Company\u2019s own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts. In addition, as the Company expands its offerings and geographies, the Company may encounter increased competition from current or new competitors. The Company\u2019s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.\nThe size of the Company\u2019s competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater resources or a more extensive customer or supplier base in some market sectors and geographic areas. As a result, the Company may not be able to effectively compete in certain markets, which could impact the Company\u2019s profitability and prospects.\nEmployee retention and hiring constraints\nIdentifying, hiring, training, developing, and retaining qualified employees is critical to the Company\u2019s success, and competition for experienced employees in the Company\u2019s industry can be intense. Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws, including visa restrictions, may limit the Company\u2019s acquisition of key talent. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the Company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demands shift, and as the Company expands its offerings, the Company may not adequately realign, train, and hire skilled personnel. The Company periodically eliminates positions due to organizational restructurings or other reasons, which may damage the Company\u2019s reputation as an employer and negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. Also, position eliminations may negatively impact the morale of employees who are not terminated, which could result in work stoppages or slowdowns, particularly where employees are represented by unions or works councils. If these circumstances occur, the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed.", "PERMNO": 27684, "SIC": 5065, "TIC": "AVT"}
