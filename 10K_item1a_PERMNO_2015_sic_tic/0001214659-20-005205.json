You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the events or developments described below occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. In that case, the value of our common stock may decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nYou should consider each of the following risk factors and any other information set forth in this Annual Report and the other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), including the Company\u2019s financial statements and related notes, in evaluating the Company\u2019s business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that impact on the Company\u2019s operations and business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently considers immaterial, may also impair its business or operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, the Company\u2019s business and financial condition, results or prospects could be harmed. Please also read carefully the section \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nWe have historically incurred significant losses and our financial situation creates doubt whether we will continue as a going concern.\nWe have historically experienced operating and net losses and anticipate continuing to experience such losses in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had an operating loss of $26,941,797 and $19,605,456 and net losses of $32,945,828 and $32,982,201, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a working capital deficiency of $19,150,075 and $18,445,302, respectively. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain additional financing through private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support our working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, we will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on acceptable terms. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If adequate working capital is not available we may be forced to discontinue operations, which would cause investors to lose their entire investment.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and need to raise additional capital to continue business development initiatives and to support our working capital requirements. However, if we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to curtail operations and take additional measures to reduce costs, including reducing our workforce, eliminating outside consultants and reducing legal fees in order to conserve cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. As a result of these financing uncertainties, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized that our dependence on ongoing capital requirements to fund our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ongoing capital requirements have only increased since then, meaning that substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern remains and will likely do so for the foreseeable future.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations in furtherance of our business plan.\nUntil we are profitable, we will need to quickly raise additional capital in order to fund our operations in furtherance of our business plan. The proposed financing may include shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, warrants to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock, debt securities, units consisting of the foregoing securities, equity investments from strategic development partners or some combination of each. Any additional equity financings may be financially dilutive to, and will be dilutive from an ownership perspective to our stockholders, and such dilution may be significant based upon the size of such financing. Additionally, we cannot assure that such funding will be available on a timely basis, in needed quantities, or on terms favorable to us, if at all.\nWe have substantial amounts of indebtedness. This indebtedness and the covenants contained in our loan documents with senior creditors substantially limit our financial and operating flexibility\nWe have entered into a number of loan documents, including security and similar agreements, with senior lenders (the \u201cSenior Lenders\u201d). These loan documents (the \u201cSenior Loan Documents\u201d) grant priority security interests in all of our assets to the Senior Lenders. Such Senior Loan Documents contain restrictions that substantially limit our financial flexibility. These Senior Loan Documents place limits on our ability to (i) incur additional indebtedness even if such indebtedness is subordinated to the debt instruments issued to the Senior Lenders, and (ii) grant security to third persons, among other matters. These restrictions limit the Company\u2019s ability to finance its future operations and capital needs. Absent the consent of the Senior Lenders, we would be unable to, among other things, obtain additional debt to raise additional capital, implement our business strategy, establish corporate infrastructure and in any other way fund the development of its business. In addition, our substantial indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from the anticipated operations to making payments on our indebtedness and other liabilities, which would limit the availability of funds for working capital and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in reacting to changes in the various industries in which we or any of our subsidiaries operates or in our competitive environment; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors who have less debt than we do, and limit our ability to borrow additional funds and increase the costs of any such additional borrowings. If we are unable to pay our debts, we would become insolvent.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt. We have defaulted on certain prior repayment obligations.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the DPW Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we have defaulted on certain prior repayment obligations as set forth below:\n\u25cf On March 23, 2018, we entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued a note in the amount of $1,000,000 to an investor. Pursuant to the terms of the note, we were required to pay interest on a monthly basis. The maturity date of this note was June 22, 2018. We did not pay the interest on a timely basis or pay the note in full on the maturity date. On July 3, 2019, we reached an agreement with the investor to repay the note under renegotiated terms with a maturity date of January 22, 2020. As of the filing date of this Form 10-K, the current principal amount outstanding on the note is $632,000.\n\u25cf On September 21, 2018, we entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued a note in the amount of $526,316 to an investor. The maturity date of this note was December 31, 2018. We did not pay the principal or accrued interest in full on the maturity date. On July 2, 2019, we entered into an exchange agreement with the investor pursuant to which, in exchange for the note issued by us to the investor, we sold to the investor a new convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $783,031 with an interest rate of 12% per annum and a maturity date of December 31, 2019. On September 26, 2019, principal and interest on the 12% Convertible Note was exchanged for a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $815,218 with an interest rate of 12% per annum and a maturity date of December 31, 2019. Further, On February 5, 2020, we entered into an exchange agreement with the investor pursuant to which, in exchange for the September 26, 2019 note issued by us to the investor, we sold to the investor a new convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $295,000 and a new promissory note in the principal amount of $585,919. Both of these notes have an interest rate of 12% per annum and a maturity date of December 31, 2019. We issued 203,448 shares of our common stock on February 25, 2020 in satisfaction of the February 5, 2020 convertible promissory note.\n\u25cf During 2018, we received funding as a result of entering into multiple Agreements for the Purchase and Sale of Future Receipts (collectively, the \u201cAgreements on Future Receipts\u201d) pursuant to which we sold in the aggregate $5,632,400 in future receipts for a purchase price in the amount of $4,100,000. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreements on Future Receipts, we were required to make payments on a daily basis until the balance of the amount sold was fully repaid. We did not make these daily payments on a timely basis. We reached an agreement with the investor to repay the Agreements on Future Receipts under renegotiated terms. As of the filing date of this Form 10-K, the amount outstanding on the Agreements on Future Receipts is $2,210,392.\n\u25cf On November 28, 2018, Blockchain Mining Supply and Services, Ltd, a vendor who sold computers to our subsidiary Digital Farms, Inc. (t/k/a Super Crypto Mining, Inc.), filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and our subsidiary (Case No. 18-cv-11099). The Complaint asserted claims for breach of contract and promissory estoppel against us and our subsidiary arising from the subsidiary\u2019s failure to satisfy a purchase agreement. The Complaint seeks damages in the amount of $1,388,495, which approximates the amount of the reserve that we have established. To date, the Court has not set a briefing schedule in connection with our anticipated motion to dismiss.\nOur business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe face business disruption and related risks resulting from the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and curtail our ability to raise financing.\nOur business has been disrupted and materially adversely affected by the recent outbreak of COVID-19. As a result of measures imposed by the governments in affected regions, businesses and schools have been suspended due to quarantines intended to contain this outbreak and many people have been forced to work from home in those areas. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the Director General of the World Health Organization declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, based on the advice of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. issued a warning on February 25, 2020 regarding the likely spread of COVID-19 to the U.S. While the COVID-19 outbreak is still in its early stages, international stock markets have begun to reflect the uncertainty associated with the slow-down in the American, Israeli and UK economies and the reduced levels of international travel experienced since the beginning of January and the significant decline in the Dow Industrial Average at the end of February 2020 was largely attributed to the effects of COVID-19. We are still assessing our business operations and system supports and the impact COVID-19 may have on our results and financial condition, but there can be no assurance that this analysis will enable us to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-19 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally or in our sectors in particular.\nOur operations are located in Alameda County, CA, Orange County, CA, Fairfield County, CT, the United Kingdom, Israel and members of our senior management work in Seattle, WA and New York, NY, which is also the location of the offices of the Company\u2019s independent auditor. The Company has been following the recommendations of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its employees for the past several weeks, including the temporary closures of its offices and having employees work remotely to the extent possible, which has to an extent adversely affected their efficiency.\nUpdates by business unit are as follows:\n\u00b7 DPW Holdings\u2019 corporate headquarters, located in Newport Beach, CA, has begun working remotely, based on the occupancy and social distancing order from the Orange County Health Officer (http://www.ochealthinfo.com/phs/about/epidasmt/epi/dip/prevention/novel_coronavirus). The headquarters staff has tested the secure remote access systems and technology infrastructure to adjust working arrangements for its employees and believes it has adequate internal communications system and can remain operational with a remote staff.\n\u00b7 Coolisys Technologies Corp., located in Fremont, CA, has temporarily suspended operations as a result of the Alameda County Public Health Department\u2019s order to cease all activities at facilities located within the County.\n\u00b7 Microphase Corporation, located in Shelton, CT, has developed an emergency plan to ensure that its mission critical manufacturing and logistical functions are up and running. Microphase has implemented additional steps to ensure a higher level of cleanliness in its facility. Employees at greater risk of major health issues from COVID-19 are not required to work on site. The crisis management team meets regularly to monitor the situation, and modifies and communicates the plan as the need arises. Once the COVID-19 crisis has passed, the team will work on transitioning Microphase back to normal operations.\n\u00b7 Gresham Power Electronics Limited, located in Salisbury, UK, temporarily suspended operations on March 19, 2020.\n\u00b7 Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd., located in Karmiel, Israel, has been granted a waiver by the Israeli government to remain open to complete key projects that impact national security. Approximately 50% of the Enertec workforce is working remotely.\nDue to the unprecedented market conditions domestically and internationally, and the effect COVID-19 has had and will continue to have on the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance, the extent of which is not currently known, the Company is temporarily suspending guidance for 2020. The Company will monitor the situation rigorously and provide business updates as circumstances warrant and resume providing guidance on the Company\u2019s business when management believes that such information would be both reliable and substantively informative.\nThe duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and vendors. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed.\nAs noted above, we rely to a great extent on external financing to fund our operations. The outbreak of COVD-19 has had a materially adverse impact on our ability to raise financing for our operations. Unless investors\u2019 outlook improves dramatically in the near future, it will further inhibit our ability to raise the funds we need to sustain our operations. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on acceptable terms.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future business prospects and to make decisions based on our historical performance.\nAlthough our executive officers have been engaged in the industries in which we operate for varying degrees of time, we did not begin operations of our current business until recently. We have a very limited operating history in our current form, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business on the basis of historical operations. As a consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results based upon our historical data. Reliance on our historical results may not be representative of the results we will achieve, and for certain areas in which we operate, principally those unrelated to defense contracting, will not be indicative at all. Because of the uncertainties related to our lack of historical operations, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in sales, product costs or expenses. If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable historical data, we could be less profitable or incur losses, which may result in a decline in our stock price.\nWe have an evolving business model, which increases the complexity of our business.\nOur business model has evolved in the past and continues to do so. In prior years we have added additional types of services and product offerings and in some cases we have modified or discontinued those offerings. We intend to continue to try to offer additional types of products or services, and we do not know whether any of them will be successful. From time to time we have also modified aspects of our business model relating to our product mix. We do not know whether these or any other modifications will be successful. The additions and modifications to our business have increased the complexity of our business and placed significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. Future additions to or modifications of our business are likely to have similar effects. Further, any new business or website we launch that is not favorably received by the market could damage our reputation or our brand. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are a holding company whose subsidiaries are given certain degree of independence and our failure to integrate our subsidiaries may adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have given our subsidiary companies and their executives a certain degree of independence in decision-making. On the one hand, this independence may increase the sense of ownership at all levels, on the other hand it has also increased the difficulty of the integration of operation and management, which has resulted in increased difficulty of management integration. In the event we are not able to successfully manage our subsidiaries this will result in operating difficulties and have a negative impact on our business.\nOur independent auditors have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not continue as a going concern, investors will lose their entire investment.\nIn its report on our financial statements included in this Annual Report, our independent auditors have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is an issue raised as a result of ongoing operating losses and a lack of financing commitments then in place to meet expected cash requirements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to generate a profit and/or obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, increasing sales or obtaining loans and grants from various financial institutions where possible. If we do not continue as a going concern, investors will lose their entire investment.\nWe received an order and a subpoena from the Commission in the investigation now known as \u201cIn the Matter of DPW Holdings, Inc.,\u201d the consequences of which are unknown.\nWe received an order and related subpoena from the Commission that stated that the staff of the Commission is conducting an investigation now known as \u201cIn the Matter of DPW Holdings, Inc.,\u201d and that the subpoena was issued as part of an investigation as to whether we and certain of our officers, directors, employees, partners, subsidiaries and/or affiliates, and/or other persons or entities, directly or indirectly, violated certain provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, in connection with the offer and sale of our securities. Although the order states that the Commission may have information relating to such alleged violations, the subpoena expressly provides that the inquiry is not to be construed as an indication by the Commission or its staff that any violations of the federal securities laws have occurred. [We have produced documents in response to the subpoena.] The Commission may in the future require us to produce additional documents or information, or seek testimony from other members of our management team.\nWe are unaware of the scope or timing of the Commissioner\u2019s investigation. As a result, we do not know how the Commission\u2019s investigation is proceeding, when the investigation will be concluded. We also are unable to predict what action, if any, might be taken in the future by the Commission or its staff as a result of the matters that are the subject to its investigation or what impact, if any, the cost of continuing to respond to subpoenas might have on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We have not established any provision for losses in respect of this matter In addition, complying with any such future requests by the Commission for documents or testimony could distract the time and attention of our officers and directors or divert our resources away from ongoing business matters. This investigation could result in significant legal expenses, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business, damage to our business and reputation, and could subject us to a wide range of remedies, including an enforcement action by the Commission. There can be no assurance that any final resolution of this and any similar matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur inability to successfully integrate new acquisitions could adversely affect our combined business; our operations are widely disbursed.\nOur growth strategy through acquisitions is fraught with risk. On June 2, 2017, we acquired a majority interest in Microphase and on May 23, 2018 we acquired Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (\u201cEnertec\u201d). Our strategy and business plan are dependent on our ability to successfully integrate Microphase\u2019s, Enertec\u2019s and our other acquisition\u2019s operations. In addition, while we are based in Newport Beach, CA, Microphase\u2019s operations are located in Shelton, Connecticut, Enertec\u2019s operations are located in Karmiel, Israel and Gresham Power\u2019s operations are located in Salisbury, England. These distant locations and others that we may become involved with in the future will stretch our resources and management time. Further, failure to quickly and adequately integrate all of these operations and personnel could adversely affect our combined business and our ability to achieve our objectives and strategy. No assurance can be given that we will realize synergies in the areas we currently operate.\nIf we make any additional acquisitions, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nWe have plans to eventually make additional acquisitions beyond Microphase and Enertec. Whenever we make acquisitions, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired companies\u2019 personnel and operations with our own. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u00b7 difficulty of integrating acquired products, services or operations;\n\u00b7 potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies;\n\u00b7 difficulty of incorporating acquired rights or products into our existing business;\n\u00b7 difficulties in disposing of the excess or idle facilities of an acquired company or business and expenses in maintaining such facilities;\n\u00b7 difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7 potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u00b7 potential inability or failure to achieve additional sales and enhance our customer base through cross-marketing of the products to new and existing customers;\n\u00b7 effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired; and\n\u00b7 potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses or product lines, or the need to spend significant amounts to retool, reposition or modify the marketing and sales of acquired products or the defense of any litigation, whether or not successful, resulting from actions of the acquired company prior to our acquisition.\nOur business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with these acquisitions, many of which cannot be presently identified, these risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\nNo assurance of successful expansion of operations.\nOur significant increase in the scope and the scale of our operations, including the hiring of additional personnel, has resulted in significantly higher operating expenses. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase. Expansion of our operations may also make significant demands on our management, finances and other resources. Our ability to manage the anticipated future growth, should it occur, will depend upon a significant expansion of our accounting and other internal management systems and the implementation and subsequent improvement of a variety of systems, procedures and controls. We cannot assure that significant problems in these areas will not occur. Failure to expand these areas and implement and improve such systems, procedures and controls in an efficient manner at a pace consistent with our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure that attempts to expand our marketing, sales, manufacturing and customer support efforts will succeed or generate additional sales or profits in any future period. As a result of the expansion of our operations and the anticipated increase in our operating expenses, along with the difficulty in forecasting revenue levels, we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our production capacity, which could result in material delays, quality issues, increased costs and loss of business opportunities, which may negatively impact our product margins and profitability.\nPart of our future growth strategy is to increase our production capacity to meet increasing demand for our goods. Assuming we obtain sufficient funding to increase our production capacity, any projects to increase such capacity may not be constructed on the anticipated timetable or within budget. We may also experience quality control issues as we implement any production upgrades. Any material delay in completing these projects, or any substantial cost increases or quality issues in connection with these projects could materially delay our ability to bring our products to market and adversely affect our business, reduce our revenue, income and available cash, all of which could harm our financial condition.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the most recent period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) Audit Standard No. 5, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that as of December 31, 2019 our internal control over financial reporting (\u201cICFR\u201d) was not effective at the reasonable assurance level:\n1. We do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts our ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting, including fair value estimates, in a timely manner. In addition, due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties during our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.\n2. We have inadequate controls to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on a timely basis from non-financial personnel to those responsible for financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact of the lack of timely communication between non-financial and financial personnel on our assessment of our reporting controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness.\n3. We did not design or maintain effective general information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) controls over certain information systems that are relevant to the mitigation of the risk pertaining to the misappropriation of assets. Specifically, we did not design and implement program change management controls for certain financially relevant systems to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting the Company\u2019s (i) financial IT applications, (ii) digital currency mining equipment, (iii) digital currency hardware wallets, and (iv) underlying accounting records, are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately.\nPlanned Remediation\nManagement, in coordination with the input, oversight and support of our Board of Directors, has identified the measures below to strengthen our control environment and internal control over financial reporting.\nIn January 2018, we hired a new Chief Financial Officer and engaged the services of a financial accounting advisory firm. In September 2018, we hired a Chief Accounting Officer and in January 2019, we hired a Senior Vice President of Finance. Finally, in May 2019, we hired an Executive Vice President and General Counsel. We have tasked these individuals with expanding and monitoring the Company\u2019s internal controls, to provide an additional level of review of complex financial issues and to assist with financial reporting. On October 7, 2019, we created an Executive Committee comprised of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President and General Counsel. The Executive Committee meets on a daily basis to address the Company\u2019s critical needs and provide a forum to approve transactions. Further, as we continue to expand our internal accounting department, the Chairman of the Audit Committee shall perform the following:\n\u00b7 assists with documentation and implementation of policies and procedures and monitoring of controls,\n\u00b7 reviews all anticipated transactions that are not considered in the ordinary course of business to assist in the early identification of accounting issues and ensure that appropriate disclosures are made in the Company\u2019s financial statements\nWe are currently working to improve and simplify our internal processes and implement enhanced controls, as discussed above, to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and to remedy the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. These material weaknesses will not be considered to be remediated until the applicable remediated controls are operating for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nIf our accounting controls and procedures are circumvented or otherwise fail to achieve their intended purposes, our business could be seriously harmed.\nWe evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of each fiscal quarter, and are annually reviewing and evaluating our internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with the Commission\u2019s rules relating to internal control over financial reporting adopted pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or our management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal control, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions, and our reputation may decline.\nWe face significant competition, including changes in pricing.\nThe markets for our products are both competitive and price sensitive. Many competitors have significant financial, operations, sales and marketing resources, plus experience in research and development, and compete with us by offering lower prices. Competitors could develop new technologies that compete with our products to achieve a lower unit price. If a competitor develops lower cost superior technology or cost-effective alternatives to our products and services, our business could be seriously harmed.\nThe markets for some of our products are also subject to specific competitive risks because these markets are highly price competitive. Our competitors have competed in the past by lowering prices on certain products. If they do so again, we may be forced to respond by lowering our prices. This would reduce sales revenues and increase losses. Failure to anticipate and respond to price competition may also impact sales and aggravate losses.\nMany of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nOur products compete and will compete with similar if not identical products produced by our competitors. These competitive products could be marketed by well-established, successful companies that possess greater financial, marketing, distribution personnel, and other resources than we do. Using said resources, these companies can implement extensive advertising and promotional campaigns, both generally and in response to specific marketing efforts by competitors. They can introduce new products to new markets more rapidly. In certain instances, competitors with greater financial resources may be able to enter a market in direct competition with us, offering attractive marketing tools to encourage the sale of products that compete with our products or present cost features that consumers may find attractive.\nOur growth strategy is subject to a significant degree of risk.\nOur growth strategy through acquisitions involves a significant degree of risk. Some of the companies that we have identified as acquisition targets or make a significant investment in may not have a developed business or are experiencing inefficiencies and incur losses. Therefore, we may lose our investment in the event that these companies\u2019 businesses do not develop as planned or that we are unable to achieve the cost efficiencies or reduction of losses as anticipated.\nFurther, in order to implement our growth plan, we have hired additional staff and consultants to review potential investments and implement our plan. As a result, we have substantially increased our infrastructure and costs. If we fail to quickly find new companies that provide revenue to offset our costs, we will continue to experience losses. No assurance can be given that our product development and investments will produce sufficient revenues to offset these increases in expenditures.\nOur business and operations are growing rapidly. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth in our operations. This has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we do not manage our growth effectively, the quality of our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our operating results. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. These systems improvements may require significant capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our financial position.\nWe are heavily dependent on our senior management, and a loss of a member of our senior management team could cause our stock price to suffer.\nIf we lose the services of Milton C. Ault III, our Chief Executive Officer, William B. Horne, our Chief Financial Officer, Amos Kohn, our President and the Chief Executive Officer of CTC, one of our principal subsidiaries, or Henry Nisser, our General Counsel and Executive Vice President, and/or certain key employees, we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis, and our business could be adversely affected. Our existing operations and continued future development depend to a significant extent upon the performance and active participation of these individuals and certain key employees. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Ault, Horne, Kohn and Nisser, and we may enter into employment agreements with additional key employees in the future, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these individuals. If we were to lose any of these individuals, we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and the continuing efforts of our executive officers and, if we are unable to retain, motivate or hire qualified personnel, our business may be severely disrupted.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents, knowledge, skills, know-how and efforts of highly skilled individuals and in particular, the expertise held by our Chief Executive Officer, Milton C. Ault III. His absence, were it to occur, would materially and adversely impact development and implementation of our projects and businesses. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract, among others, new technology developers and to retain and motivate our existing contractors. If one or more of our executive officers are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all. Therefore, our business may be severely disrupted, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new officers. In addition, if any of our executives joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose some customers.\nOur operating results may vary from quarter to quarter.\nOur operating results have in the past been subject to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and we expect that these fluctuations will continue, and may increase in magnitude, in future periods. Demand for our products is driven by many factors, including the availability of funding for our products in our customers\u2019 capital budgets. There is a trend for some of our customers to place large orders near the end of a quarter or fiscal year, in part to spend remaining available capital budget funds. Seasonal fluctuations in customer demand for our products driven by budgetary and other concerns can create corresponding fluctuations in period-to-period revenues, and we therefore cannot assure you that our results in one period are necessarily indicative of our revenues in any future period. In addition, the number and timing of large individual sales and the ability to obtain acceptances of those sales, where applicable, have been difficult for us to predict, and large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or deferral of one or more significant sales in a quarter could harm our operating results for such quarter. It is possible that, in some quarters, our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. In such events, or in the event adverse conditions prevail, the market price of our common stock may decline significantly.\nWe may be classified as an inadvertent investment company.\nWe are not engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourselves out as being engaged in those activities. Under the Investment Company Act, however, a company may be deemed an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act if the value of its investment securities is more than 40% of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on a consolidated basis.\nOur lending subsidiary, Digital Power Lending, LLC (\u201cDP Lending\u201d), operates under California Finance Lending License #60DBO-77905. Per the Investment Company Act of 1940 companies with substantially all their business confined to making small loans, industrial banking or similar business, such as DP Lending, are excluded from the definition of an investment company.\nWe have commenced digital asset mining, the output of which is cryptocurrencies, which the Commission has indicated it deems a security. In the event that the digital assets held by us exceed 40% of our total assets, exclusive of cash, we inadvertently become an investment company. An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can rely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent investment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (a) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the issuer\u2019s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (b) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We are putting in place policies that we expect will work to keep the investment securities held by us at less than 40% of our total assets, which may include acquiring assets with our cash, liquidating our investment securities or seeking a no-action letter from the Commission if we are unable to acquire sufficient assets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner.\nAs Rule 3a-2 is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available to us, we would have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after we cease being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit our ability to make certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on our earnings. In any event, we do not intend to become an investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.\nClassification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the Commission. If an investment company fails to register, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would require a restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could do as a registered investment company. Further, we would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would need to file reports under the Investment Company Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in our incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required would have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations.\nWe will not be able to successfully execute our business strategy if we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nU.S. companies that have more than 100 stockholders or are publicly traded in the U.S. and are, or hold themselves out as being, engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities are subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. Unless a substantial part of our assets consists of, and a substantial part of our income is derived from, interests in majority-owned subsidiaries and companies that we primarily control, we may be required to register and become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. If bitcoin and other virtual currencies were to be deemed securities for purposes of the Investment Company Act, or if we were deemed to own but not operate one or more of our other subsidiaries, we would have difficulty avoiding classification and regulation as an investment company.\nIf we were deemed to be, and were required to register as, an investment company, we would be forced to comply with substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our ability to borrow, limitations on our capital structure; restrictions on acquisitions of interests in associated companies, prohibitions on transactions with affiliates, restrictions on specific investments, and compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations. If we were forced to comply with the rules and regulations of the Investment Company Act, our operations would significantly change, and we would be prevented from successfully executing our business strategy. To avoid regulation under the Investment Company Act and related rules promulgated by the Commission, we could need to sell bitcoin and other assets which we would otherwise want to retain and could be unable to sell assets which we would otherwise want to sell. In addition, we could be forced to acquire additional, or retain existing, income-generating or loss-generating assets which we would not otherwise have acquired or retained and could need to forgo opportunities to acquire bitcoin and other assets that would benefit our business. If we were forced to sell, buy or retain assets in this manner, we could be prevented from successfully executing our business strategy.\nSecuritization of our assets subjects us to various risks.\nWe may securitize assets to generate cash for funding new investments. We refer to the term securitize to describe a form of leverage under which a company (sometimes referred to as an \u201coriginator\u201d or \u201csponsor\u201d) transfers income producing assets to a single-purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary (also referred to as a \u201cspecial purpose entity\u201d or \u201cSPE\u201d), which is established solely for the purpose of holding such assets and entering into a structured finance transaction. The SPE would then issue notes secured by such assets. The special purpose entity may issue the notes in the capital markets either publicly or privately to a variety of investors, including banks, non-bank financial institutions and other investors. There may be a single class of notes or multiple classes of notes, the most senior of which carries less credit risk and the most junior of which may carry substantially the same credit risk as the equity of the SPE.\nAn important aspect of most debt securitization transactions is that the sale and/or contribution of assets into the SPE be considered a true sale and/or contribution for accounting purposes and that a reviewing court would not consolidate the SPE with the operations of the originator in the event of the originator's bankruptcy based on equitable principles. Viewed as a whole, a debt securitization seeks to lower risk to the note purchasers by isolating the assets collateralizing the securitization in an SPE that is not subject to the credit and bankruptcy risks of the originator. As a result of this perceived reduction of risk, debt securitization transactions frequently achieve lower overall leverage costs for originators as compared to traditional secured lending transactions.\nIn accordance with the above description, to securitize loans, we may create a wholly owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of our assets to such subsidiary. The SPE may be funded with, among other things, whole loans or interests from other pools and such loans may or may not be rated. The SPE would then sell its notes to purchasers whom we would expect to be willing to accept a lower interest rate and the absence of any recourse against us to invest in a pool of income producing assets to which none of our creditors would have access. We would retain all or a portion of the equity in the SPE. An inability to successfully securitize portions of our portfolio or otherwise leverage our portfolio through secured and unsecured borrowings could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy, and could decrease our earnings, if any. However, the successful securitization of portions of our portfolio exposes us to a risk of loss for the equity we retain in the SPE and might expose us to greater risk on our remaining portfolio because the assets we retain may tend to be those that are riskier and more likely to generate losses. A successful securitization may also impose financial and operating covenants that restrict our business activities and may include limitations that could hinder our ability to finance additional loans and investments. The Investment Company Act may also impose restrictions on the structure of any securitizations.\nInterests we hold in the SPE, if any, will be subordinated to the other interests issued by the SPE. As such, we will only receive cash distributions on such interests if the SPE has made all cash interest and other required payments on all other interests it has issued. In addition, our subordinated interests will likely be unsecured and rank behind all of the secured creditors, known or unknown, of the SPE, including the holders of the senior interests it has issued. Consequently, to the extent that the value of the SPE's portfolio of assets has been reduced as a result of conditions in the credit markets, or as a result of defaults, the value of the subordinated interests we retain would be reduced. Securitization imposes on us the same risks as borrowing except that our risk in a securitization is limited to the amount of subordinated interests we retain, whereas in a borrowing or debt issuance by us directly we would be at risk for the entire amount of the borrowing or debt issuance.\nWe may also engage in transactions utilizing SPEs and securitization techniques where the assets sold or contributed to the SPE remain on our balance sheet for accounting purposes. If, for example, we sell the assets to the SPE with recourse or provide a guarantee or other credit support to the SPE, its assets will remain on our balance sheet. Consolidation would also generally result if we, in consultation with the SEC, determine that consolidation would result in a more accurate reflection of our assets, liabilities and results of operations. In these structures, the risks will be essentially the same as in other securitization transactions but the assets will remain our assets for purposes of the limitations described above on investing in assets that are not qualifying assets and the leverage incurred by the SPE will be treated as borrowings incurred by us for purposes of our limitation on the issuance of senior securities.\nWe may not be able to utilize our net operating loss carry forwards.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had Federal net operating loss carry forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for income tax purposes of approximately $52,884,756. Approximately $12,302,381 of NOLs generated prior to 2018 will begin to expire in 2020. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) signed in to law on March 27, 2020 provided that NOLs generated in a taxable year beginning in 2018, 2019, or 2020, may now be carried back five years and forward indefinitely. In addition, the 80% taxable income limitation is temporarily removed, allowing NOLs to fully offset net taxable income. However, we do not know if or when we will have any earnings and capital gains against which we could apply these carry forwards. Furthermore, as a result of changes in the ownership of our common stock, our ability to use our federal NOLs will be limited under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. State NOLs are subject to similar limitations in many cases. As a result, our substantial NOLs may not have any value to us.\nChanges in the U.S. tax and other laws and regulations may adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. government may revise tax laws, regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant adverse effect on our business, including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our international operations, or that could require costly changes to those operations, or the way in which they are structured. For example, the effective tax rates for most U.S. companies reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the U.S. is generally taxed at local rates, which may be much lower than U.S. tax rates. If we expand abroad and there are changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations that significantly increase the tax rates on non-U.S. income, our effective tax rate could increase and our profits could be reduced. If such increases resulted from our status as a U.S. company, those changes could place us at a disadvantage to our non-U.S. competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates.\nRisks Related to Related Party Transactions\nGeneral\nThere may be conflicts of interest between our company and certain of our related parties and their respective directors and officers which might not be resolved in our favor. More importantly, there may be conflicts between certain of our related parties and their respective directors and officers which might not be resolved in our favor. These risks are set forth below appurtenant to the relevant related party.\nAult & Company\nOur relationship with Ault & Company may enhance the difficulty inherent in obtaining financing for us as well as expose us to certain conflicts of interest.\nAt May 27, 2020, Ault & Company, of which Milton C. Ault is the chief executive officer, beneficially owned 1,362,795 shares of our common stock, consisting of 665,174 shares owned outright, 689,655 shares of common stock underlying the 8% Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $1,000,000 sold by us to Ault & Company on February 5, 2020, assuming no conversion of accrued but unpaid interest on this note, warrants to purchase 94 shares of Common Stock that are exercisable within 60 days of the date hereof and shares owned by Philou Ventures of which Ault & Company, Inc., is the Manager, consisting of: (i) 125,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock that are convertible into 2,232 shares of Common Stock, (ii) warrants to purchase 2,232 shares of Common Stock that are exercisable within 60 days of the date hereof and (iii) 3,408 shares of Common Stock. Ault & Company may not convert the note absent stockholder approval, though the Company expects that a proposal to approve such conversion will occur at its special meeting of stockholders presently scheduled to occur on June 8, 2020. Assuming Ault & Company were able to convert its note on the date of this Annual Report, Ault & Company would own a number of shares of common stock equal to 21.1% of the number of shares of common stock on the date hereof.\nFurther, Ault & Company and the Company are negotiating the terms of a proposed purchase by Ault & Company of a certain number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock. Presently, neither the number nor the terms of any such Series C Preferred Stock has been determined, and any such purchase would have to be approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders before Ault & Company would be able to vote or convert such shares of Series C Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the presently indeterminate nature of any such acquisition of Series Preferred Stock, you should be aware that the consummation of such a transaction, assuming the receipt by the Company of its stockholders approval thereof, could substantially increase Ault & Company\u2019s beneficial ownership of our shares of common stock.\nGiven the close relationship between Ault & Company on the one hand, and our company on the other, it is far from inconceivable that we could enter into additional securities purchase agreements with Ault & Company.\nAlthough we have relied on Philou to finance us in the past, which no longer beneficially owns any meaningful number of our shares of common stock, and anticipate that Ault & Company may purchase shares of our Series C Preferred Stock under an agreement providing for the purchase thereof, we cannot assure you that either Philou or Ault & Company will assist us in the future. We would far prefer to rely on these entities\u2019 assistance compared to other sources of financing as the terms they provide us are in general more favorable to us than we could obtain elsewhere. However, both Messrs. Ault and Horne could face a conflict of interest in that they serve on the board of directors of each of Ault & Company and our company. If they determine that an investment in our company is not in Ault & Company\u2019s best interest(s) we could be forced to seek financing from other sources that would not necessarily be likely to provide us with equally favorable terms. It should be noted in this context that while Mr. Nisser does not serve as a director of our company, he is its General Counsel and Executive Vice President as well as a director and the President of Ault & Company.\nOther conflicts of interest between us, on the one hand, and Ault & Company, on the other hand, may arise relating to commercial or strategic opportunities or initiatives. Mr. Ault, as the controlling shareholder of Ault & Company, may not resolve such conflicts in our favor. For example, we cannot assure you that Ault & Company would not pursue opportunities to provide financing to other entities whether or not it currently has a relationship with such other entities. Furthermore, our ability to explore alternative sources of financing other than Ault & Company may be constrained due to Mr. Ault\u2019s vision for us and he may not wish for us to receive any financing at all other than from entities that he controls.\nAvalanche International Corp.\nWe have lent a substantial amount of funds to Avalanche, a related party, whose ability to repay us is subject to significant doubt and it may not be in our stockholders\u2019 best interest to convert the notes into shares of Avalanche common stock even if we had a reasonably viable means of doing so.\nOn September 6, 2017, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Avalanche (\u201cAVLP Loan Agreement\u201d) with an effective date of August 21, 2017 pursuant to which we will provide Avalanche a non-revolving credit facility of up to $10,000,000 for a period ending on August 21, 2021.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had provided Avalanche with $9,595,079 pursuant to the non-revolving credit facility. The warrants issued in conjunction with the non-revolving credit facility entitles us to purchase up to 19,190,158 shares of Avalanche common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share for a period of five years. The exercise price of $0.50 is subject to adjustment for customary stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or similar events. The warrants may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis.\nWhile Avalanche received funds from a third party in the amount of $2,750,000 in early April of 2019 in consideration for its issuance of a convertible promissory note to such third party (the \u201cThird Party Note\u201d), $2,676,220 was used to pay an outstanding receivable due us and no amount was used to repay the debt Avalanche owes us pursuant to the AVLP Loan Agreement. There is doubt as to whether Avalanche will be able to repay this amount on a timely basis, if at all, unless it generates significant net income from its operations or receives additional financing from another source; even then, unless such financing consists solely of the issuance by Avalanche of its equity securities, it will only add to the amount that Avalanche owes other parties, which would in all likelihood not be provided unless we agreed to subordinate our right to repayment to such other third party source.\nThere is currently no liquid market for the Avalanche common stock. Consequently, even if we were inclined to convert the debt owed us by Avalanche into shares of its common stock, our ability to sell such shares is severely limited. Avalanche is not current in its filings with the Commission and is not required to register the shares of its common stock underlying the New Note or any other loan arrangement we have made with Avalanche described above. Further, even if Avalanche were willing to register such shares, it would not be permitted to do so until it has registered the shares of its common stock underlying the Third Party Note.\nAs a result, there is a doubt as to whether Avalanche will ever have the ability to repay its debts to us, or if we convert the debt owed us by Avalanche into shares of its common stock, our ability to convert such shares into cash through the sale of such shares would be severely limited until such time, if ever, a liquid market for Avalanche\u2019s common stock develops. If we are unable to recoup our investment in Avalanche in the foreseeable future or at all, such failure would have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and future prospects.\nOriginally, the loans we made to Avalanche were secured by a lien on all of Avalanche\u2019s assets. Presently, we only have third priority interest.\nOriginally, the loans we made to Avalanche were secured by a lien on all of Avalanche\u2019s assets. When Avalanche entered into the Exchange Agreement with MTIX (see below), the former owners of MTIX were granted a first priority interest in all of MTIX\u2019s assets, which constitute virtually all of Avalanche\u2019s assets and reduced our interest to that of a second position, greatly diminishing its value. When Avalanche issued the Third Party Note referred to above, it granted the third party a first priority security interest in all its assets, to include those comprised of MTIX. Both we and the former owners of MTIX consented to the subordination of our respective security interests. Since our security interests have been reduced to a third position, we will have no ability to use Avalanche\u2019s assets to offset any default in Avalanche\u2019s debt obligations to us unless and until the two other security interests are terminated, which would not occur until Avalanche\u2019s debts to the senior creditors have been repaid. We do not anticipate that Avalanche will repay its debts to these creditors within the foreseeable future and will therefore have no recourse should Avalanche default on its debts to us during this period of time. Any failure by Avalanche to repay us would therefore have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nMilton C. Ault, III and William Horne, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, and two of our directors are directors of Avalanche. In addition, Philou is the controlling stockholder of Avalanche.\nMilton C. Ault, III and William Horne, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, and two of our directors are directors of Avalanche. In addition, Philou is the controlling stockholder of Avalanche. Certain conflicts of interest between us, on the one hand, and Avalanche, on the other hand, may arise relating to commercial or strategic opportunities or initiatives, in addition to the conflicts related to the debt that Avalanche owes us. For example, Messrs. Ault and Horne may find it difficult to determine how to meet their fiduciary duties to us as well as Avalanche, which could result in a less favorable result for us than would be the case if they were solely directors of our company. Further, even if Messrs. Ault and Horne were able to successfully meet their fiduciary obligations to us and Avalanche, the fact that are members of the board of directors of both companies could attenuate their ability to focus on our business and best interests, possibly to the detriment of both companies. Mr. Ault\u2019s control of Philou through Ault & Company only enhances the risk inherent in having Messrs. Ault and Horne serve as directors of both our company and Avalanche.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry - Overview\nTechnology changes rapidly in our business, and if we fail to anticipate new technologies, the quality, timeliness and competitiveness of our products will suffer.\nRapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies and/or distribution platforms our products must take advantage of in order to make them competitive in the market at the time they are released. Therefore, we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve. We may not be able to achieve these goals, or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can. In either case, our products may be technologically inferior to competitive products, or less appealing to consumers, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products, then we may delay products until these technology goals can be achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses. Alternatively, we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies, either to preserve our product launch schedule or to keep up with our competition, which would increase our development expenses and adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent upon our ability, and our contract manufacturers\u2019 ability, to timely procure electronic components.\nBecause of the global economy, many raw material vendors have reduced capacities, closed production lines and, in some cases, even discontinued their operations. As a result, there is a global shortage of certain electronic or mineral components, which may extend our production lead-time and our production costs. Some materials are no longer available to support some of our products, thereby requiring us to search for cross materials or, even worse, redesign some of our products to support currently-available materials. Such redesign efforts may require certain regulatory and safety agency re-submittals, which may cause further production delays. While we have initiated actions that we believe will limit our exposure to such problems, the dynamic business conditions in many of our markets may challenge the solutions that have been put in place, and issues may recur in the future.\nIn addition, some of our products are manufactured, assembled and tested by third party subcontractors and contract manufacturers located in Asia. While we have had relationships with many of these third parties in the past, we cannot predict how or whether these relationships will continue in the future. In addition, changes in management, financial viability, manufacturing demand or capacity, or other factors, at these third parties could hurt our ability to manufacture our products.\nOur strategic focus on our custom power supply solution competencies and concurrent cost reduction plans may be ineffective or may limit our ability to compete.\nAs a result of our strategic focus on custom power supply solutions, we will continue to devote significant resources to developing and manufacturing custom power supply solutions for a large number of customers, where each product represents a uniquely tailored solution for a specific customer\u2019s requirements. Failure to meet these customer product requirements or a failure to meet production schedules and/or product quality standards may put us at risk with one or more of these customers. Moreover, changes in market conditions and strategic changes at the direction of our customers may affect their decision to continue to purchase from us. The loss of one or more of our significant custom power supply solution customers could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, business or financial condition.\nWe have also implemented a series of initiatives designed to increase efficiency and reduce costs. While we believe that these actions will reduce costs, they may not be sufficient to achieve the required operational efficiencies that will enable us to respond more quickly to changes in the market or result in the improvements in our business that we anticipate. In such event, we may be forced to take additional cost-reducing initiatives, including those involving our personnel, which may negatively impact quarterly earnings and profitability as we account for severance and other related costs. In addition, there is the risk that such measures could have long-term adverse effects on our business by reducing our pool of talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products or services, making it more difficult for us to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our solutions increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be.\nWe depend upon a few major customers for a majority of our revenues, and the loss of any of these customers, or the substantial reduction in the quantity of products that they purchase from us, would significantly reduce our revenues and net income.\nWe currently depend upon a few major OEMs and other customers for a significant portion of our revenues. If our major OEM customers will reduce or cancel their orders scaling back some of their activities, our revenues and net income would be significantly reduced. Furthermore, diversions in the capital spending of certain of these customers to new network elements have and could continue to lead to their reduced demand for our products, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If the financial condition of one or more of our major customers should deteriorate, or if they have difficulty acquiring investment capital due to any of these or other factors, a substantial decrease in our revenues would likely result. We are dependent on the electronic equipment industry, and accordingly will be affected by the impact on that industry of current economic conditions.\nSubstantially all of our existing customers are in the electronic equipment industry, and they manufacture products that are subject to rapid technological change, obsolescence, and large fluctuations in demand. This industry is further characterized by intense competition and volatility. The OEMs serving this industry are pressured for increased product performance and lower product prices. OEMs, in turn, make similar demands on their suppliers, such as us, for increased product performance and lower prices. Such demands may adversely affect our ability to successfully compete in certain markets or our ability to sustain our gross margins.\nOur reliance on subcontract manufacturers to manufacture certain aspects of our products involves risks, including delays in product shipments and reduced control over product quality.\nSince we do not own significant manufacturing facilities, we must rely on, and will continue to rely on, a limited number of subcontract manufacturers to manufacture our power supply products. Our reliance upon such subcontract manufacturers involves several risks, including reduced control over manufacturing costs, delivery times, reliability and quality of components, unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations, and continued inflationary pressures on many of the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our power supply products. If we were to encounter a shortage of key manufacturing components from limited sources of supply, or experience manufacturing delays caused by reduced manufacturing capacity, inability of our subcontract manufacturers to procure raw materials, the loss of key assembly subcontractors, difficulties associated with the transition to our new subcontract manufacturers or other factors, we could experience lost revenues, increased costs, and delays in, or cancellations or rescheduling of, orders or shipments, any of which would materially harm our business.\nWe outsource, and are dependent upon developer partners for, the development of some of our custom design products.\nWe made an operational decision to outsource some of our custom design products to numerous developer partners. This business structure will remain in place until the custom design volume justifies expanding our in house capabilities. Incomplete product designs that do not fully comply with the customer specifications and requirements might affect our ability to transition to a volume production stage of the custom designed product where the revenue goals are dependent on the high volume of custom product production. Furthermore, we rely on the design partners\u2019 ability to provide high quality prototypes of the designed product for our customer approval as a critical stage to approve production.\nWe face intense industry competition, price erosion and product obsolescence, which, in turn, could reduce our profitability.\nWe operate in an industry that is generally characterized by intense competition. We believe that the principal bases of competition in our markets are breadth of product line, quality of products, stability, reliability and reputation of the provider, along with cost. Quantity discounts, price erosion, and rapid product obsolescence due to technological improvements are therefore common in our industry as competitors strive to retain or expand market share. Product obsolescence can lead to increases in unsaleable inventory that may need to be written off and, therefore, could reduce our profitability. Similarly, price erosion can reduce our profitability by decreasing our revenues and our gross margins. In fact, we have seen price erosion over the last several years on most of the products we sell, and we expect additional price erosion in the future.\nOur future results are dependent on our ability to establish, maintain and expand our manufacturers\u2019 representative OEM relationships and our other relationships.\nWe market and sell our products through domestic and international OEM relationships and other distribution channels, such as manufacturers\u2019 representatives and distributors. Our future results are dependent on our ability to establish, maintain and expand our relationships with OEMs as well as with manufacturers\u2019 representatives and distributors to sell our products. If, however, the third parties with whom we have entered into such OEM and other arrangements should fail to meet their contractual obligations, cease doing, or reduce the amount of their, business with us or otherwise fail to meet their own performance objectives, customer demand for our products could be adversely affected, which would have an adverse effect on our revenues.\nWe may not be able to procure necessary key components for our products, or we may purchase too much inventory or the wrong inventory.\nThe power supply industry, and the electronics industry as a whole, can be subject to business cycles. During periods of growth and high demand for our products, we may not have adequate supplies of inventory on hand to satisfy our customers' needs. Furthermore, during these periods of growth, our suppliers may also experience high demand and, therefore, may not have adequate levels of the components and other materials that we require to build products so that we can meet our customers' needs. Our inability to secure sufficient components to build products for our customers could negatively impact our sales and operating results. We may choose to mitigate this risk by increasing the levels of inventory for certain key components. Increased inventory levels can increase the potential risk for excess and obsolescence should our forecasts fail to materialize or if there are negative factors impacting our customers\u2019 end markets. If we purchase too much inventory or the wrong inventory, we may have to record additional inventory reserves or write-off the inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and on our results of operations.\nAlthough we depend on sales of our legacy products for a meaningful portion of our revenues, these products are mature and their sales will decline.\nA relatively large portion of our sales have historically been attributable to our legacy products. We expect that these products may continue to account for a meaningful percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future. However, these sales are declining. Although we are unable to predict future prices for our legacy products, we expect that prices for these products will continue to be subject to significant downward pressure in certain markets for the reasons described above. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or increase revenues will be dependent on our ability to expand our customer base, to increase unit sales volumes of these products and to successfully, develop, introduce and sell new products such as custom design and value-added products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our customer base, increase unit sales volumes of existing products or develop, introduce and/or sell new products.\nFailure of our information technology infrastructure to operate effectively could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. If a problem occurs that impairs this infrastructure, the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate.\nWe are subject to certain governmental regulatory restrictions relating to our international sales.\nSome of our products are subject to International Traffic In Arms Regulation (\u201cITAR\u201d), which are interpreted, enforced and administered by the U.S. Department of State. ITAR regulation controls not only the export, import and trade of certain products specifically designed, modified, configured or adapted for military systems, but also the export of related technical data and defense services as well as foreign production. Any delays in obtaining the required export, import or trade licenses for products subject to ITAR regulation and rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. In addition, changes in United States export and import laws that require us to obtain additional export and import licenses or delays in obtaining export or import licenses currently being sought could cause significant shipment delays and, if such delays are too great, could result in the cancellation of orders. Any future restrictions or charges imposed by the United States or any other country on our international sales or foreign subsidiary could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. In addition, from time to time, we have entered into contracts with the Israeli Ministry of Defense which were governed by the U.S. Foreign Military Financing program (\u201cFMF\u201d). Any such future sales would be subject to these regulations. Failure to comply with ITAR or FMF rules could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, and/or operating results.\nWe depend on international operations for a substantial majority of our components and products.\nWe purchase a substantial majority of our components from foreign manufacturers and have a substantial majority of our commercial products assembled, packaged, and tested by subcontractors located outside the United States. These activities are subject to the uncertainties associated with international business operations, including trade barriers and other restrictions, changes in trade policies, governmental regulations, currency exchange fluctuations, reduced protection for intellectual property, war and other military activities, terrorism, changes in social, political, or economic conditions, and other disruptions or delays in production or shipments, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or operating results.\nWe depend on international sales for a portion of our revenues.\nSales to customers outside of North America accounted for 56.9% and 29.9% of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a material portion of our total revenues. International sales are subject to the risks of international business operations as described above, as well as generally longer payment cycles, greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable, and currency restrictions. In addition, Gresham, our wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, supports our European and other international customers, distributors, and sales representatives, and therefore is also subject to local regulation. International sales are also subject to the export laws and regulations of the United States and other countries.\nOur sales and profitability may be affected by changes in economic, business and industry conditions.\nIf the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their technology and entertainment investments. Reduced or delayed technology and entertainment investments could decrease our sales and profitability. In this environment, our customers may experience financial difficulty, cease operations and fail to budget or reduce budgets for the purchase of our products and professional services. This may lead to longer sales cycles, delays in purchase decisions, payment and collection, and can also result in downward price pressures, causing our sales and profitability to decline. In addition, general economic uncertainty and general declines in capital spending in the information technology sector make it difficult to predict changes in the purchasing requirements of our customers and the markets we serve. There are many other factors which could affect our business, including:\n\u00b7 The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies, products and services;\n\u00b7 New competitors and new forms of competition;\n\u00b7 The size and timing of customer orders (for retail distributed physical product);\n\u00b7 The size and timing of capital expenditures by our customers;\n\u00b7 Adverse changes in the credit quality of our customers and suppliers;\n\u00b7 Changes in the pricing policies of, or the introduction of, new products and services by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 Changes in the terms of our contracts with our customers or suppliers;\n\u00b7 The availability of products from our suppliers; and\n\u00b7 Variations in product costs and the mix of products sold.\nThese trends and factors could adversely affect our business, profitability and financial condition and diminish our ability to achieve our strategic objectives.\nThe sale of our products is dependent upon our ability to satisfy the proprietary requirements of our customers.\nWe depend upon a relatively narrow range of products for the majority of our revenue. Our success in marketing our products is dependent upon their continued acceptance by our customers. In some cases, our customers require that our products meet their own proprietary requirements. If we are unable to satisfy such requirements, or forecast and adapt to changes in such requirements, our business could be materially harmed.\nThe sale of our products is dependent on our ability to respond to rapid technological change, including evolving industry-wide standards, and may be adversely affected by the development, and acceptance by our customers, of new technologies which may compete with, or reduce the demand for, our products.\nRapid technological change, including evolving industry standards, could render our products obsolete. To the extent our customers adopt such new technology in place of our products, the sales of our products may be adversely affected. Such competition may also increase pricing pressure for our products and adversely affect the revenues from such products.\nOur limited ability to protect our proprietary information and technology may adversely affect our ability to compete, and our products could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against us, the results of which could be costly.\nMany of our products consist entirely or partly of proprietary technology owned by us. Although we seek to protect our technology through a combination of copyrights, trade secret laws and contractual obligations, these protections may not be sufficient to prevent the wrongful appropriation of our intellectual property, nor will they prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In order to defend our proprietary rights in the technology utilized in our products from third party infringement, we may be required to institute legal proceedings, which would be costly and would divert our resources from the development of our business. If we are unable to successfully assert and defend our proprietary rights in the technology utilized in our products, our future results could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our product development efforts, we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, require us to reengineer or cease sales of our products or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us. In addition, parties making claims may be able to obtain an injunction, which could prevent us from selling our products in the United States or abroad.\nIf we are unable to satisfy our customers\u2019 specific product quality, certification or network requirements, our business could be disrupted and our financial condition could be harmed.\nOur customers demand that our products meet stringent quality, performance and reliability standards. We have, from time to time, experienced problems in satisfying such standards. Defects or failures have occurred in the past, and may in the future occur, relating to our product quality, performance and reliability. From time to time, our customers also require us to implement specific changes to our products to allow these products to operate within their specific network configurations. If we are unable to remedy these failures or defects or if we cannot effect such required product modifications, we could experience lost revenues, increased costs, including inventory write-offs, warranty expense and costs associated with customer support, delays in, or cancellations or rescheduling of, orders or shipments and product returns or discounts, any of which would harm our business.\nIf we ship products that contain defects, the market acceptance of our products and our reputation will be harmed and our customers could seek to recover their damages from us.\nOur products are complex, and despite extensive testing, may contain defects or undetected errors or failures that may become apparent only after our products have been shipped to our customers and installed in their network or after product features or new versions are released. Any such defect, error or failure could result in failure of market acceptance of our products or damage to our reputation or relations with our customers, resulting in substantial costs for us and our customers as well as the cancellation of orders, warranty costs and product returns. In addition, any defects, errors, misuse of our products or other potential problems within or out of our control that may arise from the use of our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers. Our customers could seek to have us pay for these losses. Although we maintain product liability insurance, it may not be adequate.\nSome of our business is subject to U.S. government procurement laws and regulations.\nWe must comply with certain laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our federal government contracts, including the business that we do as a subcontractor. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur additional costs, and non-compliance may lead to the assessment of fines and penalties, including contractual damages, or the loss of business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry - Microphase\nMicrophase has a history of losses and our future profitability on a quarterly or annual basis is uncertain, which could have a harmful effect on our business and the value of our company.\nDuring the past three fiscal years Microphase has incurred losses from operations. These losses are attributable to lower volumes of its products sold to major defense contractors partially as a result of the overall reduction in defense spending and sequestration by the U.S. Congress. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Microphase has been significantly short of capital needed to acquire parts for production of its products to complete orders for such products. At times, Microphase has not had the cash available to make advance payments for the purchase of parts, and then, as a consequence, Microphase would not receive the parts from its vendors required to finish a customer order. This would then delay the delivery of products to customers, and would also delay recognition of the resulting revenues and the receipt of cash from the customer. Sometimes after experiencing a delay in delivery of an order from Microphase, the customer would not place its next order with Microphase, resulting in a loss of business.\nMicrophase\u2019s future profitability depends upon many factors, including several that are beyond its control. These factors include, without limitation:\n\u00b7 changes in the demand for ITS products and services;\n\u00b7 loss of key customers or contracts;\n\u00b7 the introduction of competitive products;\n\u00b7 the failure to gain market acceptance of ITS new and existing products; and\n\u00b7 the failure to successfully and cost effectively develop, introduce and market new products, services and product enhancements in a timely manner.\nIn addition, Microphase is incurring significant legal, accounting, and other expenses related to being a reporting company without there being a trading market for any of its securities. As a result of these expenditures, Microphase will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to achieve and maintain future profitability.\nA large percentage of Microphase\u2019s current revenue is derived from prime defense contractors to the U.S. government and its allies, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in U.S. government funding or a change in U.S. government spending priorities or bidding processes could have an adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMicrophase is highly dependent on sales to major defense contractors of the U.S. military and its allies, including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, BAE Systems and SAAB. The percentages of its revenue that were derived from sales to these named major defense contractors and directly to the U.S. Government were 51.5% in fiscal 2019 and 55.6% in fiscal 2018. Therefore, any significant disruption or deterioration of Microphase\u2019s relationship with any such major defense contractors or the U.S. Government could materially reduce its revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2019 there were three customers that accounted for more than 10% of sales: BAE Systems, Raytheon Company and Lockheed Martin. During the year ended December 31, 2018 there were four customers that accounted for more than 10% of sales: BAE Systems, Raytheon Company, Saab and Lockheed Martin. Microphase\u2019s competitors continuously engage in efforts to expand their business relationships with the same major defense contractors and the U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the future, and the U.S. Government may choose to use other contractors. Microphase expects that a majority of the business that it seeks will be awarded through competitive bidding. Microphase operates in highly competitive markets and its competitors have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than Microphase does in many areas, and Microphase may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts or to obtain task orders under multi-award contracts. Further, the competitive bidding process involves significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to Microphase, as well as the risk that Microphase may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill any contract awarded to us. Following any contract award, Microphase may experience significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result of its competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to it in competitive bidding. Major defense contractors to whom Microphase supplies components for systems must compete with other major defense contractors (to which Microphase may not supply components) for military orders from the U.S. Government.\nIn addition, Microphase competes with other policy needs, which may be viewed as more necessary, for limited resources and an ever-changing amount of available funding in the budget and appropriation process. Budget and appropriations decisions made by the U.S. Government are outside of Microphase control and have long-term consequences for its business. U.S. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including until recently sequestration (automatic, across-the-board U.S. Government budgetary spending cuts), and the purchase of our products could be superseded by alternate arrangements. While the US defense budget was recently increased, there can be no assurance that this increase will be maintained for the foreseeable future, particularly in light of the recent federal expenditures the federal government has made with a view to ameliorating the economic damage suffered as a result of COVID-19. A change in U.S. Government spending priorities or an increase in non-procurement spending at the expense of our programs, or a reduction in total U.S. Government spending, could have material adverse consequences on Microphase\u2019s future business.\nMicrophase\u2019s U.S. government contracts may be terminated by the federal government at any time prior to their completion, which could lead to unexpected loss of sales and reduction in Microphase\u2019s backlog.\nUnder the terms of Microphase\u2019s U.S. government contracts, the U.S. government may unilaterally:\n\u00b7 terminate or modify existing contracts;\n\u00b7 reduce the value of existing contracts through partial termination; and\n\u00b7 delay the payment of Microphase\u2019s invoices by government payment offices.\nThe federal government can terminate or modify any of its contracts with Microphase or its prime contractors either for the federal government\u2019s convenience, or if Microphase or its prime contractors default, by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. A termination arising out of Microphase\u2019s default could expose it to liability and have a material adverse effect on its ability to compete for future federal government contracts and subcontracts. If the federal government or its prime contractors terminate and/or materially modify any of Microphase\u2019s contracts or if any applicable options are not exercised, Microphase\u2019s failure to replace sales generated from such contracts would result in lower sales and would adversely affect its earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on Microphase\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Microphase\u2019s backlog as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $6.4 million. Microphase\u2019s backlog could be adversely affected if contracts are modified or terminated.\nMicrophase\u2019s products with military applications are subject to export regulations, and compliance with these regulations may be costly.\nMicrophase is required to obtain export licenses before filling foreign orders for many of its products that have military or other governmental applications. United States Export Administration regulations control technology exports like its products for reasons of national security and compliance with foreign policy, to guarantee domestic reserves of products in short supply and, under certain circumstances, for the security of a destination country. Thus, any foreign sales of its products requiring export licenses must comply with these general policies. Compliance with these regulations is costly, and these regulations are subject to change, and any such change may require Microphase to improve its technologies, incur expenses or both in order to comply with such regulations.\nMicrophase depends on U.S. government contracts issued to major defense contractors, which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination or failure to fund, or negative audit findings for, one or more of these contracts could have an adverse impact on Microphase\u2019s business.\nOver its lifetime, a U.S. Government program awarded to a major defense contractor may be implemented by the award of many different individual contracts and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized and appropriated in connection with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis. Procurement funds are typically made available for obligations over the course of one to three years. Consequently, programs often receive only partial funding initially, and additional funds are designated only as Congress authorizes further appropriations. The termination of funding for a U.S. Government program with respect to major defense contractors for which Microphase is a subcontractor would result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which could have an adverse impact on its operations. In addition, the termination of, or failure to commit additional funds to, a program for which Microphase is a subcontractor could result in lost revenue and increase its overall costs of doing business.\nGenerally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. Such audits could result in adjustments to Microphase\u2019s contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. Microphase has recorded contract revenues based on costs Microphase expect to realize upon final audit. However, Microphase does not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments, and Microphase may be required to materially reduce its revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.\nIn addition, U.S. Government contracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the U.S. Government\u2019s convenience upon the payment only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. Microphase can give no assurance that one or more of the U.S. Government contracts with a major defense contractor under which Microphase provides component products will not be terminated under these circumstances. Also, Microphase can give no assurance that it will be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of its U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion of Microphase\u2019s revenue is dependent on its performance and payment under its U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMicrophase\u2019s government business also is subject to specific procurement regulations and other requirements. These requirements, though customary in U.S. Government contracts, increase its performance and compliance costs. In addition, these costs might increase in the future, thereby reducing Microphase\u2019s margins, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have an adverse impact on Microphase\u2019s operations and could have an adverse effect on its standing and eligibility for future U.S. Government contracts.\nMicrophase\u2019s business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and disruptions.\nAs a U.S. Government defense contractor, Microphase faces certain security threats, including threats to its information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to its proprietary or classified information, threats to physical security, and domestic terrorism events. Microphase\u2019s information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of its business and essential to its ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. Microphase is also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, which generally face similar security threats. Cybersecurity threats in particular, are persistent, evolve quickly and include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, attempts to access information, denial of service and other electronic security breaches. Microphase believes that it has implemented appropriate measures and controls and has invested in skilled information technology resources to appropriately identify threats and mitigate potential risks, but there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to mission critical systems, the unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data. A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and information technology networks and related systems could:\n\u00b7 disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore its operations and/or those of certain of its customers;\n\u00b7 result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of Microphase or its customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against Microphase or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\u00b7 compromise national security and other sensitive government functions;\n\u00b7 require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result;\n\u00b7 subject Microphase to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and\n\u00b7 damage Microphase\u2019s reputation with its customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. Government) and the public generally.\nAny or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMicrophase enters into fixed-price contracts that could subject it to losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in inflation.\nMicrophase has a number of fixed-price contracts which allow it to benefit from cost savings but subject it to the risk of potential cost overruns, particularly for firm fixed-price contracts, because Microphase assumes the entire cost burden. If its initial estimates are incorrect, Microphase can lose money on these contracts. U.S. Government contracts can expose Microphase to potentially large losses because the U.S. Government can hold Microphase responsible for completing a project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of its replacement by another provider regardless of the size or foreseeability of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications, unforeseen events such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with its suppliers and cost overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to Microphase. The U.S. and other countries also may experience a significant increase in inflation. A significant increase in inflation rates could have a significant adverse impact on the profitability of these contracts. Furthermore, if Microphase does not meet contract deadlines or specifications, Microphase may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of its contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if Microphase fails to meet the terms specified in those contracts Microphase may not realize their full benefits. Microphase\u2019s results of operations are dependent on its ability to maximize its earnings from its contracts. Cost overruns could have an adverse impact on its financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry - Enertec\nPotential political, economic and military instability in Israel could adversely affect our operations.\nEnertec\u2019s operating facilities are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect Enertec\u2019s operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since October 2000, there has been an increase in hostilities between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs, which has adversely affected the peace process and has negatively influenced Israel\u2019s relationship with its Arab citizens and several Arab countries, including the Israel-Gaza conflict. Such ongoing hostilities may hinder Israel\u2019s international trade relations and may limit the geographic markets where Enertec can sell its products and solutions. Hostilities involving or threatening Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, could materially and adversely affect Enertec\u2019s operations.\nIn addition, Israel-based companies and companies doing business with Israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by members of the Arab League and certain other predominantly Muslim countries since Israel\u2019s establishment. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved. Wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in significant damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing the level of foreign and local investment.\nFurthermore, certain of our officers and employees may be obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called up for active military duty at any time. All Israeli male citizens who have served in the army are subject to an obligation to perform reserve duty until they are between 40 and 49 years old, depending upon the nature of their military service.\nEnertec may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by its employees, which could result in litigation and harm our business.\nA significant portion of the intellectual property covered by Enertec\u2019s products has been developed by Enertec\u2019s employees in the course of their employment for Enertec. Under the Israeli Patent Law, 5727-1967, or the Patent Law, and recent decisions by the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee, a body constituted under the Patent Law, Israeli employees may be entitled to remuneration for intellectual property that they develop for us unless they explicitly waive any such rights. To the extent that Enertec is unable to enter into agreements with its future employees pursuant to which they agree that any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement are owned exclusively by Enertec (as it has done in the past), Enertec may face claims demanding remuneration. As a consequence of such claims, Enertec could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to its current and former employees, or be forced to litigate such claims, which could negatively affect its business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf we do not continue to satisfy the NYSE American continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted from NYSE American.\nThe listing of our common stock on the NYSE American is contingent on our compliance with the NYSE American\u2019s conditions for continued listing. On December 18, 2015, we were notified by the NYSE American that we were no longer in compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards because our reported stockholders' equity was below continued listing standards. The NYSE American requires that a listed company's stockholders' equity be $4.0 million or more if it has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years. Subsequently, the NYSE American informed us that we are required to attain stockholders\u2019 equity of $6.0 million or more because we experienced a loss for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFollowing submission of our compliance plan demonstrating how we intend to regain compliance with the continued listing standards, we were notified on March 9, 2016, that the NYSE American granted us a listing extension on the basis of our plan until June 19, 2017. We are subject to periodic review by NYSE American staff during the extension period. Failure to make progress consistent with the plan or to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by the end of the extension period could result in our common stock being delisted from the NYSE American.\nOn June 19, 2017, we filed a Form 8-K report with the Commission announcing that our Stockholders' Equity was approximately $6,409,000 on a pro-forma basis. In a letter dated June 20, 2017, the NYSE American notified us that we had successfully regained compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in light of our continued losses, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to meet the NYSE American continued listing standard. If we fail to meet the NYSE American listing requirement, we may be subject to delisting by the NYSE American. In the event our common stock is no longer listed for trading on the NYSE American, our trading volume and share price may decrease and we may experience further difficulties in raising capital which could materially affect our operations and financial results.\nOn November 20, 2017, we received a letter from NYSE Regulation indicating that the NYSE American had concluded that we failed to comply with Section 401(a) of the NYSE American\u2019s Company Guide, which section requires that a listed company \u201cmake immediate public disclosure of all material information concerning its affairs\u201d The letter, which relates to our disclosure of certain personnel changes to our board of directors and officers, provided that such letter constituted a warning letter issued to us pursuant to Section 1009(a)(i) of the NYSE American Company Guide. On October 12, 2017, we filed a Form 8-K that disclosed that certain personnel changes to our board of directors and executive officers were effective October 6, 2017. On November 6, 2017, we filed an amendment to the above referenced Form 8-K that disclosed that the personnel changes had not in fact occurred. After discussion with the NYSE American, on November 8, 2017, we filed a subsequent Form 8-K that further clarified that we had determined to rescind the personnel changes as of October 23, 2017. In that Form 8-K, we provided additional disclosure explaining why the personnel changes were not undertaken.\nOn November 29, 2017, we notified the NYSE American, LLC that we were no longer in compliance with Rule 801(h) of the NYSE American Company Guide because, as a smaller reporting company, our Board of Directors was not comprised of at least 50% independent directors. On November 28, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the issuance of cash compensation, and 10,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock subject to vesting and stockholder approval, to Mr. William Horne, a director of our company, for services. As a result of this compensation, Mr. Horne may not be deemed independent within the meaning of Section 803A(2) of the NYSE American Company Guide. Mr. Horne has resigned from the audit committee of the Board of Directors. Robert Smith has been appointed as chair of the audit committee. On December 8, 2017, our board of directors rescinded the equity compensation granted to Mr. Horne. We believe that we were therefore in compliance with Rule 801(h) of the NYSE American Company Guide and that we remain so.\nOn January 4, 2019, we received a deficiency letter from NYSE American indicating that we were not in compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d). Specifically, the letter informed the Company that the Exchange has determined that the shares of our common stock have been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time and, pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide, the Company's continued listing is predicated on the Company effecting a reverse stock split of our common stock or otherwise demonstrating sustained price improvement within a reasonable period of time, which the NYSE American determined to be no later than July 4, 2019. As noted above, on March 18, 2019 we effectuated a reverse split whereby each twenty (20) shares of our common stock were combined into one such share, which increased the market price to a level where we regained compliance with the Company Guide (the \u201cMarch Split\u201d). However, since that time our common stock has declined significantly and there can be no assurance that it will not continue to do so. If the decline is sufficiently marked, we will in all likelihood receive another letter similar to the one referenced above; however, there can be no assurance that we could in that event successfully conduct another reverse split on a timely basis, if at all, or that the NYSE Exchange will not take more drastic action, up to and including delisting our shares of common stock from the exchange.\nWhile we believed at the time that the March Split achieved its intended objectives, as the closing market price of the Common Stock on that date was $1.68, substantially above the $1.00 market price that the NYSE American prefers the issuers listed on the NYSE American maintain, and well above the market prices that lead it to issue letters of various kinds to its listed issuers, we also believed it to be in our own and our stockholders\u2019 best interest to effectuate another reverse stock split due to certain deleterious events that occurred subsequent to March 14, 2019.\nThe first to occur of these events was a precipitous drop in the market price near the end of the trading day of March 15, 2019. As noted above, the closing market price on March 14, 2019 was $1.68. While this price level was not fully sustained during the trading day of March 15, 2019, in the last few minutes the price dropped precipitously, with the CMP being $0.71.\nThe second event that caused a significant slide in the market price of the Common Stock was our press release dated March 29, 2019, which announced the pricing of a public offering. On April 3, 2019, we announced that this public offering had closed on April 2, 2019. On March 28, 2019, the closing market price was approximately $0.71, only slightly lower than the closing market price on March 15, 2019, meaning that the CMP was substantially steady for the two weeks following the March Split. On March 29, 2019, however, the closing market price fell to approximately $0.29. This drop in the market price was clearly occasioned by the announcement of the pricing of the public offering and was entirely unrelated to the March Split. As of May 31, 2019, the closing market price was approximately $0.15, substantially below the level required by the NYSE American and very significantly below its preferred minimum level of $1.00.\nOn July 23, 2019, pursuant to the authorization provided by our stockholders at our reconvened 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on July 19, 2019, our Board approved an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to effectuate a reverse stock split of our common stock that reduced the issued and outstanding number of such shares by a ratio of one-for-forty (the \u201cJuly Split\u201d). The July Split became effective in the State of Delaware on August 5, 2019. Since that time, the market price of our shares of common stock has been in compliance with the NYSE\u2019s listing standards.\nIf we should fail to maintain compliance with NYSE American low-priced continued listing standards in the future, then our common stock securities will be subject to delisting. Delisting could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and on the trading of the common stock. If our common stock were to be delisted, then it could be quoted on the OTCQB market or on the \u201cpink sheets\u201d maintained by the OTC Markets Group. However, such alternatives are generally considered to be less efficient markets. Further, delisting from the NYSE American could also have other negative effects, including potential loss of confidence by partners, lenders, suppliers and employees and could also trigger various defaults under our lending agreements and other outstanding agreements. Finally, delisting could make it harder for us to raise capital and sell securities.\nOur common stock price is volatile.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE American. In the past, our trading price has fluctuated widely, depending on many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. The exercise of outstanding options and warrants may adversely affect our stock price and a stockholder\u2019s percentage of ownership. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 2,763 shares of common stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $731.62 per share, exercisable at prices ranging from $480 to $1,856 per share and warrants to purchase up to 72,518 shares of common stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $206.57 per share, at exercise prices ranging from $8 to $2,000 per share.\nOn April 2, 2019, pursuant to the underwriting agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners entered into on March 29, 2019, as referenced above, we issued an aggregate of 793,325 shares of common stock, including shares of common stock underlying warrants. The sale of these shares of our common stock, including those underlying the warrants (assuming exercise thereof), has had a material and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, we have previously agreed to register shares of common stock, and common stock underlying outstanding warrants and convertible debt in connection with private placement of our securities that are not being registered in this annual report. Our shares of common stock are thinly traded. Therefore, the resale of a large number of shares of common stock and common stock underlying warrants and convertible debt by the selling stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nVolatility in our common stock price may subject us to securities litigation.\nStock markets, in general, have experienced, and continue to experience, significant price and volume volatility, and the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. This increased volatility, coupled with depressed economic conditions, could continue to have a depressing effect on the market price of our common stock. The following factors, many of which are beyond our control, may influence our stock price:\n\u00b7 the status of our growth strategy including the development of new products with any proceeds we may be able to raise in the future;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological or competitive developments;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments affecting us, our customers or our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements regarding patent or other intellectual property litigation or the issuance of patents to us or our competitors or updates with respect to the enforceability of patents or other intellectual property rights generally in the US or internationally;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u00b7 changes in the economic performance or market valuations of our competitors;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of our executive officers; and\n\u00b7 sales or perceived sales of additional shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, the securities markets have, from time to time, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. Any of these factors could result in large and sudden changes in the volume and trading price of our common stock and could cause our stockholders to incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against that company. If we were involved in a class action suit or other securities litigation, it would divert the attention of our senior management, require us to incur significant expense and, whether or not adversely determined, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have a substantial number of convertible notes, warrants, options and preferred stock outstanding that could affect our price.\nDue to a number of financings, we have a substantial number of shares that are subject to issuance pursuant to outstanding convertible debt, warrants and options. These conversion prices and exercise prices range from $8 to $2,000 per share of common stock. As of December 31, 2019, the number of shares of common stock subject to convertible notes, warrants, options and preferred stock were 1,252,163, 72,518, 2,763 and 2,232, respectively. The issuance of common stock pursuant to convertible notes, warrants, options and preferred stock at conversion or exercise prices less than market prices may have the effect of limiting an increase in market price of our common stock until all of these underling shares have been issued.\nWe have a number of shares of common stock subject to registration rights.\nDue to a number of financings, we have contractually agreed to register with the Commission shares of common stock, and common stock underlying outstanding warrants and convertible debt in connection with private placements of our securities. The potential resale at the same time of a large number of shares of common stock and common stock underlying warrants and convertible debt by the selling stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale, by us or others, including the issuance of common stock upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We and our directors and officers may sell shares into the market, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.\nThe rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation gives our board of directors the right to create new series of preferred stock. As a result, the board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock. Preferred stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control. The possible impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock or to create a series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nWe are a public company and subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. For example, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that our management report on the effectiveness of our internal controls structure and procedures for financial reporting. Section 404 compliance may divert internal resources and will take a significant amount of time and effort to complete. If we fail to maintain compliance under Section 404, or if in the future management determines that our internal control over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE American should we in the future be listed on this market, the Commission, or other regulatory authorities. Furthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Any failure of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stated results of operations and harm our reputation. If we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on internal controls from our independent auditors. We may need to hire a number of additional employees with public accounting and disclosure experience in order to meet our ongoing obligations as a public company, particularly if we become fully subject to Section 404 and its auditor attestation requirements, which will increase costs. Our management team and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to new compliance initiatives and to meeting the obligations that are associated with being a public company, which may divert attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are discovered or if we otherwise fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. Our research coverage by industry and financial analysts is currently limited. Even if our analyst coverage increases, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under law and the existence of indemnification rights for or obligations to our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains a provision permitting us to eliminate the personal liability of our directors to us and our stockholders for damages for the breach of a fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent provided by Delaware law. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under any future employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and the resulting costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock and, accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company. The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.", "PERMNO": 84302, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "DPW"}
