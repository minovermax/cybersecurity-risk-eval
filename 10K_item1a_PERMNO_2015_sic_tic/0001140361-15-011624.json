{"cik": "1165231", "company": "PROCERA NETWORKS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in considering our business and prospects. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history on which to evaluate our Company.\nThe products we sell today are derived primarily from the products of the Netintact companies that we acquired in 2006. We are continually working to improve our operations on a combined basis.\nFurthermore, we have only recently launched many of our products and services on a worldwide basis, and we are continuing to develop relationships with distribution partners and otherwise exploit sales channels in new markets. Therefore, investors should consider the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets, which include the following:\n\u00b7 successfully introducing new products and entering new markets;\n\u00b7 successfully servicing and upgrading new products once introduced;\n\u00b7 increasing brand recognition;\n\u00b7 developing strategic relationships and alliances;\n\u00b7 managing expanding operations and sales channels;\n\u00b7 successfully responding to competition; and\n\u00b7 attracting, retaining and motivating qualified personnel.\nIf we are unable to address these risks and uncertainties, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance and investor expectations.\nFrom time to time, we may release guidance in our earnings releases, earnings conference calls or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the time of release of the guidance. Any such guidance, which will include forward-looking statements, will be based on projections prepared by our management.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. These projections are also based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We may state possible outcomes as high and low ranges, which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to indicate that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason why we may release guidance is to provide an opportunity for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. With or without our guidance, analysts and other investors may publish their own expectations regarding our business, financial performance and results of operations. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what our management believes is realizable as of the time of release. Actual results will vary from our guidance, and the variations may be material. If our actual performance does not meet or exceed our guidance or investor expectations, the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nIn addition, historically we have received, and in the future we may receive, a material portion of a quarter\u2019s sales orders during the last two weeks of the quarter. Accordingly, there is a risk that our revenue may move from one quarter to the next, or not be realized at all, if we cannot fulfill all of the orders and satisfy all the revenue recognition criteria under our accounting policies before the quarter ends. If completed purchase orders are not obtained in a timely manner, our products are not shipped on time, we fail to manage our inventory properly, we fail to release new products on schedule or we are unable to fulfill orders for any other reason, our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors, which may result in a decline in our stock price.\nOur PacketLogic family of products is our primary product line. A substantial majority of our current revenues and a significant portion of our future growth depend on our ability to continue its commercialization.\nA substantial majority of our current revenues and much of our anticipated future growth depend on the development, introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products in our PacketLogic product line that address additional market requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. In the past, we have experienced delays in product development and such delays may occur in the future. Our future growth will largely be determined by market acceptance and continued development of our PacketLogic product line.\nIf additional customers do not adopt, purchase and deploy our PacketLogic products, our revenues will not grow and may decline. In addition, should our prospective customers fail to recognize, or our current customers lose confidence in, the value or effectiveness of our PacketLogic product line, the demand for our products and services will likely decline. Any significant price compression in our targeted markets as a result of newly introduced solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products, customers may defer purchasing our existing products. These actions could harm our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence.\nMarketing and sales of our products to large broadband service providers often involve a lengthy evaluation and sales cycle, which may cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and could result in us expending significant resources without making any sales.\nOur sales cycles often are lengthy because our prospective customers generally follow complex procurement procedures and undertake significant testing to assess the performance of our products within their networks. As a result, we may invest significant time from initial contact with a prospective customer before that customer decides to purchase and incorporate our products in its network. We may also expend significant resources attempting to persuade large broadband service providers to incorporate our products into their networks without any measure of success. Even after deciding to purchase our products, initial network deployment and acceptance testing of our products by a large broadband service provider may last several years. Network operators, especially in North America, often require that products they purchase meet Network Equipment Building System, or NEBS, certification requirements, which relate to the reliability of telecommunications equipment. While our PacketLogic products and future products are and are expected to continue to be designed to meet NEBS certification requirements, they may fail to do so, and any failure to meet NEBS certification requirements could have a material adverse impact on our ability to sell our products.\nDue to our lengthy sales cycle, particularly to larger customers, and our revenue recognition practices, we expect our revenue may fluctuate significantly from period to period. In pursuing sales opportunities with larger enterprises, we expect that we will make fewer sales to larger entities, but that the magnitude of individual sales will be greater. We may report substantial revenue growth in the period that we recognize the revenue from a large sale, which may not be repeated in an immediately subsequent period. Because our revenues may fluctuate materially from period to period, the price of our common stock may decline. In addition, even after we have received commitments from a customer to purchase our products, in accordance with our revenue recognition practices, we may not be able to recognize and report the revenue from that purchase for months or years after the time of purchase. As a result, there could be significant delays in our receipt and recognition of revenue following sales orders for our products.\nIn addition, if a competitor succeeds in convincing a prospective customer to adopt that competitor\u2019s product, it may be difficult for us to displace the competitor at a later time because of the cost, time, effort and perceived risk to network stability involved in changing to a different vendor\u2019s products. As a result, we may incur significant sales and marketing expenses without generating any sales.\nWe need to increase the functionality of our products and offer additional features in order to be competitive.\nThe market in which we operate is highly competitive and unless we continue to enhance the functionality of our products by adding additional features, our competitive position may deteriorate and the average selling prices for our products may decrease over time. Such a decrease also could result from the introduction of competing products or from the standardization of Deep Packet Inspection, or DPI, technology. To counter this trend, we endeavor to enhance our products by offering higher system speeds and additional performance features, such as additional protection functionality, supporting additional applications and enhanced reporting tools. We may also need to reduce our per unit manufacturing costs at a rate equal to or faster than the rate at which selling prices may decline. If we are unable to reduce these costs or to offer increased functionality and features, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our inventory, we could have excess inventory or experience inventory shortages, which could result in decreased revenue and gross margins and harm our business.\nIn determining the required quantities of our products to produce, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on inventory levels, market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of inventory we require. This could result in shortages if we fail to anticipate demand, or excess inventory and write-offs if we order more inventory than we need or if anticipated sales do not occur.\nIn addition, at any time, a significant amount of our inventory may be located off-site at customer locations while our customers evaluate and conduct trials of our products. If these trials do not result in sales of our products, we may need to take inventory charges or fully write-off such inventory. Additionally, inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand recognition and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our revenues may be dependent on a small number of Tier 1 service providers that purchase in large quantities. If we are unable to maintain or replace our relationships with these customers, our revenues may fluctuate and our growth may be limited.\nSince 2008, when we first sold our products to Tier 1 service providers, a significant portion of our revenue has come from a limited number of customers. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to continue to achieve revenue growth from these customers because their capacity requirements have become or will become fulfilled. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that any customer will place follow-on orders after fulfillment of current orders. For this reason, we do not expect that any single customer will remain a significant customer from year to year, and we will need to attract new customers in order to sustain our revenues. Moreover, our current customers may cancel orders or their agreements with us. Order cancellations could adversely affect our product sales and revenues and, therefore, harm our business and results of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2013, revenue from three customers, Shaw Communications, Inc., British Telecommunications plc and Itochu Techno-Solutions Corp. represented 13%, 12% and 10% of net revenues, respectively, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2012, revenue from one customer, Shaw Communications, Inc., represented 16% of net revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of net revenues.\nIn any future year or quarter, the proportion of our revenues derived from a limited number of customers may be higher than in prior periods. If we cannot maintain or replace the customers that purchase large amounts of our products, or if they do not purchase products at the levels or at the times that we anticipate, our ability to maintain or grow our revenues will be adversely affected.\nChanges in customer or product mix, downward pressure on sales prices, changes in volume of orders and other factors could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future.\nOur gross profit margins have fluctuated from period to period, and these fluctuations are expected to continue in the future. Within the last three years, our gross profit margin has fluctuated from 49% for the three months ended September 30, 2013 to 72% for the three months ended September 30, 2012. Factors that may cause our gross margins to fluctuate include customer and product mix, market acceptance of our new products, competitive pricing dynamics, geographic and/or market segment pricing strategies, decreases in average selling prices of our products, our ability to successfully develop new products and our ability to manage manufacturing, labor and materials costs. A higher proportion of hardware sales versus software and service revenue in any period generally results in a lower gross profit margin for that period. In addition, our industry has been characterized by declining product prices over time, and we are under continuous pressure to reduce our prices to increase or even maintain our market share. Forecasting our gross margins is difficult due to our lengthy sales cycle, particularly with respect to larger customers, and our revenue recognition practices. Because our gross profit margins may fluctuate materially from period to period, or decline over time, the price of our common stock may decline.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and may be unable to compete effectively with competitors which are substantially larger and more established and have greater resources.\nIn our rapidly evolving and highly competitive market, we compete on the price as well as the performance of our products. We expect competition to remain intense in the future. Increased competition could result in reduced prices and gross margins for our products and loss of market share, and could require us to increase spending on research and development, sales and marketing and customer support, any of which could have a negative financial impact on our business. We compete with Allot Communications Ltd., Tektronix, Inc. (acquired Arbor Networks), Blue Coat Systems, Inc., Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Citrix Systems, Inc. (acquired Bytemobile), Science Applications International Corporation (acquired Cloudshield Technologies), Ericsson, Networks, Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and Sandvine Corporation, as well as other companies which sell products incorporating competing technologies. In addition, our products and technology compete with other types of products that offer monitoring capabilities, such as probes and related software. We also face indirect competition from companies that offer broadband service providers increased bandwidth and infrastructure upgrades that increase the capacity of their networks, which may lessen or delay the need for bandwidth management solutions.\nMost of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have significantly greater name recognition and financial, sales and marketing, technical, manufacturing and other resources and more established distribution channels than we do. In addition, some prospective customers have in the past advised us that their concerns about our financial condition disqualified us from competing successfully for their business. It is possible that one or more prospective customers could raise similar concerns in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully against our current or potential competitors as our competitors may, among other things, be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can. Furthermore, prospective customers often have expressed greater confidence in the product offerings of our competitors. Additional competitors may enter our existing or future markets with solutions that may be less expensive, provide higher performance or provide additional features than our solutions. Given the opportunities in the bandwidth management solutions market, we also expect that other companies may enter the market with alternative products and technologies, which could reduce the sales or market acceptance of our products and services, perpetuate intense price competition or make our products obsolete. If any technology that is competing with ours is or becomes more reliable, higher performing, less expensive or has other advantages over our technology, then the demand for our products and services would decrease, which would harm our business.\nCompetition for experienced and skilled personnel is intense and our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could significantly damage our business.\nOur future performance will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our management to operate effectively, both individually and as a group. We are dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate high caliber key personnel. Our growth expectations will require us to attract experienced personnel to augment our current staff. We expect to continue to recruit experienced professionals in such areas as software and hardware development, sales, technical support, product marketing and management. We may expand our indirect channel partner program in the future and we would need to attract qualified business partners to broaden these sales channels. In our market, there is significant competition for qualified personnel and we may not be able to attract and retain such personnel. Our business may suffer if we encounter material delays in hiring additional personnel.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our executive officers and other key employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, James Brear, and our Chief Technical Officer, Alexander Hav\u00e4ng. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, our engineering department is based in Varberg, Sweden, and many of our engineers were formerly employees of Netintact, which we acquired in 2006. In January 2013, we acquired Vineyard and we now employ many former Vineyard engineers and product developers in Kelowna, Canada. We are continuing to develop plans to integrate the Canadian and Swedish engineering teams, and this integration effort may result in changes to current job responsibilities. If some or all of our Sweden-based engineers or Canada-based engineers or product developers were no longer employed by us, our ability to develop new products and serve existing customers could be materially and adversely impacted, and our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected.\nWe believe we will need to attract, retain and motivate talented management and other highly skilled employees in order to execute on our business plan. We may be unable to retain our key employees or attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. Competitors and others have in the past, and may in the future, attempt to recruit our employees. In California, where we are headquartered, non-competition agreements with employees generally are unenforceable. As a result, if an employee based in California leaves our Company for any reason, he or she will generally be able to begin employment with one of our competitors or otherwise compete immediately against us.\nWe currently do not have key person insurance in place. If we lose one of our key officers, we would need to attract, hire and retain an equally competent person to take his or her place. There is no assurance that we would be able to find such an employee in a timely fashion. If we fail to recruit an equally qualified replacement or incur a significant delay, our business plans may slow down. We could fail to implement our strategy or lose sales and marketing and development momentum.\nMergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, limit our growth prospects or reduce our revenues.\nWe believe that there may be consolidation in our industry, which could lead to increased price competition and other forms of competition. Increased competition may cause pricing pressure and loss of market share, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, may limit our growth prospects or reduce our revenues and margins. Our competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with strategic partners or other parties. Established companies may not only develop their own products but may also merge with or acquire our current competitors as a means of entering our markets. New competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Any of these circumstances could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our anticipated growth, we may experience operating inefficiencies and have difficulty meeting demand for our products.\nWe seek to manage our growth so as not to exceed our available capital resources. If our customer base and market grow rapidly, we would need to expand to meet this demand. This expansion could place a significant strain on our management, products and support operations, sales and marketing personnel and other resources, which could harm our business.\nIf demand for our products and services grows rapidly, we may experience difficulties meeting the demand. For example, the installation and use of our products require customer training. If we are unable to provide adequate training and support for our products, the implementation process will be longer and customer satisfaction may be lower. In addition, we may not be able to exploit fully the growing market for our products and services, and our competitors may be better able to satisfy this demand. We cannot assure you that our systems, procedures or controls will be adequate to support the anticipated growth in our operations. The failure to meet the challenges presented by rapid customer and market expansion could cause us to miss sales opportunities and otherwise have a negative impact on our sales and profitability.\nWe may not be able to install management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner, and our current or planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations.\nA currently pending proxy contest could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.\nOn February 25, 2015, Tristan Partners L.P., a stockholder that, together with a group of affiliated stockholders, claims to collectively own approximately 1.5% of our outstanding common stock, nominated eight individuals for election to our Board of Directors at our 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In addition, on February 26, 2015, Castle Union Partners, L.P., a stockholder that, together with a group of affiliated stockholders, claims to collectively own approximately 6.6% of our outstanding common stock, nominated five individuals for election to our Board of Directors at our 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nAs a result of these pending proxy contests, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other proposals from stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. We have retained the services of various professionals to advise us on these matters, including legal, financial and communications advisors, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of these and any similar stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors and business partners, and cause our common share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation. Moreover, if new individuals are elected to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our current initiatives, retain and attract experienced executives and employees, and execute on our long-term strategy.\nWe have limited ability to protect our intellectual property and defend against claims, which may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe rely primarily on patent law, trademark law, copyright law, trade secret law and contractual rights to protect our intellectual property rights in our PacketLogic product line. We cannot assure you that the actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights or that other parties will not independently develop similar or competing products that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. We enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and take appropriate measures to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise misappropriate or use our products or technology.\nIn an effort to protect our unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information. These agreements may be breached, and we may not become aware of, or have adequate remedies in the event of, any such breach. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Furthermore, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Additionally, in some cases, customers have the right to request access to our source code upon demand. Some of our customers have obtained the source code for our products by exercising this right, and others may do so in the future. In addition, some of our customers have required us to deposit the source code of our products into a source code escrow. The conditions triggering the release of the escrowed source code vary by customer, but include, among other things, breach of the applicable customer agreement, failure to provide required product support or maintenance, or if we are subject to a bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise fail to carry on our business in the ordinary course. Disclosing the content of our source code may limit the intellectual property protection we can obtain or maintain for that source code or the products containing that source code and may facilitate intellectual property infringement claims against us. It also could permit a customer to which source code is disclosed to support and maintain that software product without being required to purchase our support or maintenance services. Each of these could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. This type of litigation often is very costly and can continue for a lengthy period of time. If we are found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, or if we agree to settle any such claims, we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights. Any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid any claims of infringement may be costly or impractical. Litigation resulting from claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others, or litigation that we initiate to protect our intellectual property rights, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources from sales and/or development activities, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If we fail to apply for intellectual property protection or if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries, our competitors may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAcquisitions may divert management\u2019s attention, increase expenses and disrupt or otherwise have a negative impact on our business.\nWe may seek to acquire or make investments in complementary businesses, products, services or technologies on an opportunistic basis when we believe they will assist us in executing our business strategy. Growth through acquisitions has been a viable strategy used by other network control and management technology companies. We acquired the Netintact entities in 2006, and its products have formed the core of our current product offering. In January 2013, we acquired Vineyard Networks Inc., or Vineyard, a company based in Kelowna, Canada. We have integrated the employees of Vineyard into our organizational structure, and we are developing plans for further product and organizational integration, which will require both time and investment to accomplish. Any failure to properly integrate the personnel or technology we hire or acquire, including successfully maintaining cohesive technology development in distant locations, could have an adverse effect on us and our results of operations. Any future acquisitions that we may pursue could distract or divert the attention of our management and employees and cause us to incur various expenses related to identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.\nFollowing any acquisition, the integration of the acquired business, product, service or technology is complex, time consuming and expensive, and may disrupt our business. These challenges include the timely and efficient execution of a number of post-transaction integration activities, including:\n\u00b7 integrating the operations and technologies of the two companies;\n\u00b7 retaining and assimilating the key personnel of each company;\n\u00b7 retaining existing customers of both companies and attracting additional customers;\n\u00b7 leveraging our existing sales channels to sell new products into new markets;\n\u00b7 developing an appropriate sales and marketing organization and sales channels to sell new products into new markets;\n\u00b7 retaining strategic partners of each company and attracting new strategic partners; and\n\u00b7 implementing and maintaining uniform standards, internal controls, processes, procedures, policies and information systems.\nThe process of integrating operations and technology could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our business and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with an acquisition and the integration of our operations and technology could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, the execution of these post-transaction integration activities will involve considerable risks and may not come to pass as we envision. The inability to integrate the operations, technology and personnel of an acquired business with ours, or any significant delay in achieving integration, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and, as a result, on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisitions, including the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in the timeframe that we originally expect, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we originally had anticipated because of a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the possibility that the acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected and the possibility that we may not be able to expand the reach and customer base for current and future products as expected. For example, during the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, we recorded a partial impairment of the NAVL intangible assets and a full impairment of the NAVL reporting unit goodwill, which were acquired through our acquisition of Vineyard in January 2013. As a result of these risks, our acquisitions may not immediately contribute to our earnings as expected, or at all, we may not achieve expected revenue synergies or realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the acquisitions.\nWe are in the process of expanding our research and development group and implementing new strategic initiatives. If we are not successful in implementing these initiatives, or if these initiatives do not result in the intended benefits, our operating results could suffer.\nWe have recently embarked upon several new initiatives that are designed to expand our product offerings and our addressable market. These initiatives include: (1) RAN Perspectives, a Radio Access Network awareness solution, to gain device and location intelligence that will compete with a new set of probe and Customer Experience Assurance solutions, (2) Video Perspectives, a new Video Intelligence offering that will compete with Big Data solutions, and (3) Network Function Virtualization versions of our PacketLogic products that will change our business model to shift more towards software sales rather than hardware combined with software. We will need to expend a significant amount of time and cost to develop and implement these initiatives, including adding key resources in research and development and marketing. Moreover, we may experience unanticipated difficulties or delays in implementing these initiatives, and we may not complete these initiatives on our expected timetable, if at all, or within our projected budget. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that these initiatives, once implemented, will improve our business or our financial performance, and we may incur expenses without the benefit of higher revenues. If we are unable to successfully implement these initiatives or fail to do so on a timely basis, or if these initiatives do not provide us with the intended benefits, our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nIf our products contain undetected software or hardware errors or performance deficiencies, we could incur significant unexpected expenses, experience purchase order cancellations and lose sales.\nNetwork products frequently contain undetected software or hardware errors, failures or bugs when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace. Because we frequently introduce new versions and updates to our product line, previously unaddressed errors in the accuracy or reliability of our products, or issues with their performance, may arise. We expect that such errors or performance deficiencies will be found from time to time in the future in new or existing products, including the components incorporated therein, after the commencement of commercial shipments. These problems may have a material adverse effect on our business by requiring us to incur significant warranty repair costs and support related replacement costs, diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from new product development efforts, delaying the recognition of revenue and causing potentially significant customer relations problems.\nIn addition, if our products are not accepted by customers due to software or hardware defects or performance deficiencies, orders contingent upon acceptance may be cancelled or deferred until we have remedied the defects, which could result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue recognition. In this circumstance, or if warranty returns exceed the amount we have accrued for defect returns based on our historical experience, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur products must properly interface with products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a computer or communications network, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems. The occurrence of hardware and software errors, whether or not caused by our products, could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses. The occurrence of any such problems would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have incurred losses in previous periods and may incur losses in future periods.\nWe had an accumulated deficit of $94.0 million as of December 31, 2014. We may incur losses from operations in future periods. The profitability we achieved in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were the first in our history and may not be indicative of profitability in future periods. In addition, our sales and marketing, research and development and certain other costs have been increasing in recent years and we may not be able to manage this growth in costs effectively. Any losses incurred in the future may result from increased costs related to continued investments in sales and marketing, product development and administrative expenses and/or less than anticipated revenues. Furthermore, if our revenue growth does not continue or is slower than anticipated, or our operating expenses exceed expectations, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nFailure to expand our sales teams or educate them about technologies and our product families may harm our operating results.\nThe sale of our products requires a multi-faceted approach directed at several levels within a prospective customer\u2019s organization. We may not be able to increase net revenue unless we expand our sales teams to address all of the customer requirements necessary to sell our products. We expect to continue hiring in sales and marketing, but there can be no assurance that personnel additions will have a positive effect on our business.\nIf we are not able to successfully integrate new employees into our Company or to educate current and future employees with regard to rapidly evolving technologies and our product families, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIncreased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nWe offer technical support services with our products because they are complex and time consuming to implement. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services offered by our competitors. Further customer demand for these services, without increases in corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. If we experience financial difficulties, do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts, or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts, the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted, which could materially harm our relationships with these customers and our results of operations.\nWe must continue to develop and increase the productivity of our indirect distribution channels to increase net revenue and improve our operating results.\nA key focus of our distribution strategy is developing and increasing the productivity of our indirect distribution channels through resellers and distributors. If we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant resellers, or if these resellers are not able to execute on their sales efforts, sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer. Many of our resellers also sell products from other vendors that compete with our products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into additional reseller and/or distribution agreements or that we will be able to manage our product sales channels. Our failure to take any of these actions could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenue. In addition, our operating results will likely fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and amount of orders from our resellers. We cannot assure you that our resellers and/or distributors will continue to market or sell our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales, marketing and technical support. Such failure would negatively affect our ability to generate revenue and our potential to achieve profitability.\nWe rely on a small number of suppliers for our hardware products. If we are unable to have our products manufactured quickly enough to keep up with demand or we experience manufacturing quality problems, our operating results could be harmed.\nIf the demand for our products grows, we will need to increase our capacity for material purchases, production, testing and quality control functions. Any disruptions in product flow could limit our revenue growth, adversely affect our competitive position and reputation and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders under agreements with our customers.\nWhile our PacketLogic products are software-based, we rely on independent suppliers to manufacture the hardware components on which our products are installed and operate. In certain circumstances, these suppliers also provide logistics services, which may include loading our software products onto the hardware platforms, testing and inspecting the products, and then shipping them directly to our customers. If these suppliers are unable to meet our demand, or fail to provide such logistics services as we may request in a timely manner, we may experience delays in product shipments. Other performance problems with suppliers may arise in the future, such as inferior quality, insufficient quantity of products or the interruption or discontinuance of operations of a supplier, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe do not know whether we will effectively manage our suppliers or whether these suppliers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of product components of sufficient quality and quantity. If one or more of our suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or decide not to continue its business relationship with us, we would need to identify other suppliers to perform these services, and there could be product delivery delays while we seek to establish and implement the new relationship. We also plan to introduce new products and product enhancements, which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers. Any delays in meeting customer demand or quality problems resulting from the inability of our suppliers to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality product components, including problems relating to logistic services, could result in lost or reduced future sales to key customers and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nAs part of our cost management efforts, we endeavor to lower per unit product costs from our suppliers by means of volume efficiencies that utilize manufacturing sites in lower-cost geographies. However, we cannot be certain when or if such cost reductions will occur. The failure to obtain such cost reductions would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results.\nIf our suppliers fail to adequately supply us with certain original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, sourced components, our product sales may suffer.\nReliance upon OEMs, as well as industry supply conditions, generally involves several additional risks, including the possibility of a shortage of components and reduced control over delivery schedules (which can adversely affect our distribution schedules) and increases in component costs (which can adversely affect our profitability). Most of our hardware products, or the components of our hardware components, are based on industry standards and are therefore available from multiple manufacturers. If our suppliers were to fail to deliver, alternative suppliers should be available, although qualification of the alternative manufacturers and establishment of reliable suppliers could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which could adversely affect our operating results. However, in some specific cases we have single-sourced components because alternative sources are not currently available. If these components were not available for a period of time, we could experience product supply interruptions, delays or inefficiencies, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have operations outside of the United States and a significant portion of our customers and suppliers are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting international operations.\nWe market and sell our products throughout the world and have personnel in many parts of the world. In addition, we have sales offices and research and development facilities outside the United States and we conduct, and expect to continue to conduct, a significant amount of our business with companies that are located outside the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia. Any international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to new risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These risks include:\n\u00b7 trade and foreign exchange restrictions;\n\u00b7 foreign currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u00b7 economic or political instability in foreign markets;\n\u00b7 greater difficulty in enforcing contracts, accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods;\n\u00b7 changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7 the uncertainty and limitation of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u00b7 costs of compliance with foreign laws and regulations and the risks and costs of non-compliance with such laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 costs of complying with U.S. laws and regulations for foreign operations, including import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u00b7 heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements;\n\u00b7 the potential for political unrest, acts of terrorism, hostilities or war;\n\u00b7 management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural differences and geographic dispersion; and\n\u00b7 multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures.\nOur product and service sales may be subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country and change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. Further, in many foreign countries, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations applicable to us. Although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, distribution channels and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, distribution channels or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business.\nOur general business strategy may be adversely affected by the current volatile global business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If financial markets continue to experience volatility or deterioration, it may make any debt or equity financing that we require more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. In addition, a renewed or deeper economic downturn may result in reduced demand for our products, or adversely impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our products, which would harm our operating results. There is also a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive in the current economic environment, which would directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by product sales occurring outside the United States and fluctuations in the value of the United States Dollar against foreign currencies.\nA significant and increasing percentage of our sales are generated outside of the United States. In most circumstances, our sales are denominated in the local currency. Revenues and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies could affect our operating results as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate. Changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities because we translate foreign net sales, costs of goods, assets and liabilities into U.S. Dollars for presentation in our financial statements. The primary foreign currencies for which we currently have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the Canadian dollar, the European Union Euro, the Swedish Krona, British Pound and the Australian Dollar. If our revenues continue to grow, in part because we have entered new foreign markets, we could be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in other currencies. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2012, we established a sales office in Japan in order to attempt to penetrate the important Japanese marketplace in which we are a new competitor. Exchange rates between currencies such as the Japanese Yen and the U.S. Dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may do so in the future. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, and other companies have incurred significant losses as a result of their foreign currency operations. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. We currently do not hedge our foreign currency risk.\nIn addition, the ongoing sovereign debt crisis concerning certain European countries, including Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, and related European financial restructuring efforts, may cause the value of the Euro to decline. Rating agency downgrades on European sovereign debt and continuing concern over the potential default of European government issuers has further contributed to this uncertainty. The ongoing uncertainty created by volatile currency markets in Russia may also affect our operating results. Because we are unlikely to be able to increase our selling prices to compensate for any deterioration in currencies, such currency fluctuations could adversely affect our operating results.\nAccounting charges may cause fluctuations in our annual and quarterly financial results, which could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nOur financial results may be materially affected by non-cash and other accounting charges. Such accounting charges may include:\n\u00b7 amortization of intangible assets, including acquired product rights;\n\u00b7 impairment of goodwill and intangible assets;\n\u00b7 stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u00b7 impairment of long-lived assets.\nThe foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred in connection with or as a result of business acquisitions. The price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing accounting charges. Our effective tax rate may increase, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.\nOur effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u00b7 changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u00b7 changing tax laws, regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings;\n\u00b7 changes in accounting and tax treatment of stock-based compensation;\n\u00b7 the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods; and\n\u00b7 tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, which could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place.\nThe price of our common stock could decline if our financial results are materially adversely affected by one or more of the foregoing factors.\nOur internal controls may be insufficient to ensure timely and reliable financial information.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to evaluate and provide a management report of our systems of internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to our internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u00b7 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n\u00b7 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n\u00b7 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nA material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 we did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nWe have in the past and may in the future have deficiencies in our internal control processes and procedures. Under the supervision of our Audit Committee, we are continuing the process of identifying and implementing corrective actions as required to improve the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including the enhancement of systems and procedures. We have a small finance and accounting staff and limited resources and expect that we will continue to be subject to the risk of material weaknesses and significant deficiencies.\nEven after corrective actions are implemented, the effectiveness of our controls and procedures may be limited by a variety of risks, including:\n\u00b7 faulty human judgment and simple errors, omissions or mistakes;\n\u00b7 collusion of two or more people;\n\u00b7 inappropriate management override of procedures; and\n\u00b7 the risk that enhanced controls and procedures may still not be adequate to assure timely and reliable financial information.\nIf we fail to have effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting in place, we could be unable to provide timely and reliable financial information. Additionally, if we fail to have effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting in place, it could adversely affect our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements under certain government contracts.\nLegislative actions, higher insurance costs and new accounting pronouncements are likely to impact our future financial position and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory changes and future accounting pronouncements and regulatory changes have, and will continue to have, an impact on our future financial position and results of operations. In addition, insurance costs, including health and workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums, have increased in recent years and are likely to continue to increase in the future. Recent and future pronouncements related to the accounting treatment of executive compensation and equity awards may also impact operating results. These and other potential changes could materially increase the expenses we report under GAAP and adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in accounting standards, especially those that relate to management estimates and assumptions, are unpredictable and subject to interpretation by management and our independent registered public accounting firm and may materially impact how we report and record our financial condition.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Under each of these policies, it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, using different assumptions, or as new information becomes available. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, the SEC, other regulators and our outside independent registered public accounting firm) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we recently dismissed Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm and retained McGladrey LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. At the time of our dismissal of Ernst & Young LLP, we did not have any disagreement with Ernst & Young LLP regarding our accounting policies and practices. Our new independent registered public accounting firm may view our estimates and assumptions, or interpret policies, differently than our prior independent registered public accounting firm. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, or apply an existing standard differently (and also retroactively), resulting in a change in our results on a going forward basis or a potential restatement of historical financial results.\nUnauthorized disclosure of data or unauthorized access to our information systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe may experience interruptions in our information systems on which our global operations depend. Further, we may face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems, to intentionally hack, interfere with or cause physical or digital damage to or failure of such systems (such as significant viruses or worms), which attempts we may be unable to prevent. We could be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects until after it is too late to prevent it and the damage it may cause. Any security breaches, unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, virus or similar breach or disruption could result in loss of confidential information, personal data and customer content, damage to our reputation, early termination of our contracts, litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities. If our security measures, or those of our partners or service providers, are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to confidential information, personal data or customer content, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer or we could incur significant liability. The theft, unauthorized use or a cybersecurity attack that results in the publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could negatively affect our competitive position or the value of our investment in product or research and development, and third parties might assert against us or our customers claims related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information or end-user data and/or system reliability. In any such event, our business could be subject to significant disruption, and we could suffer monetary and other losses, including reputational harm.\nOur headquarters are located in Northern California where disasters may occur that could disrupt our operations and harm our business.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Silicon Valley in Northern California. Historically, this region has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to us and our local suppliers. In addition, terrorist acts or acts of war targeted at the United States, and specifically Silicon Valley, could cause damage or disruption to us, our employees, facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors and resellers and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Although we currently have redundant capacity in Sweden and Canada in the event of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in Silicon Valley, our business could nonetheless suffer. Our operations in Sweden and Canada are subject to disruption by extreme winter weather.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Although we have hired several employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and new regulations of the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, have and will create additional compliance requirements for companies such as ours. The expenses incurred by public companies generally to meet SEC reporting, finance and accounting and corporate governance requirements have been increasing in recent years as a result of these changing laws, regulations and standards. To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, in reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards. These investments have resulted in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe may need to raise further capital, which could dilute or otherwise adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 interest in our Company.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, along with the cash that we expect to generate from operations and any debt financing that management currently believes is available, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next twelve months.\nA number of factors may negatively impact our level of cash availability and working capital requirements, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7 lower than anticipated revenues;\n\u00b7 higher than expected cost of goods sold or operating expenses;\n\u00b7 our inability to liquidate short-term investments; or\n\u00b7 the inability of our customers to pay for the goods and services ordered.\nWe believe that the ability to obtain equity and debt financing in the future will depend on our operating results, general economic conditions and global credit market conditions. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fund expansion, take advantage of unanticipated growth or acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures. In addition, we may be required to defer or cancel product development programs, lay-off employees and/or take other steps to reduce our operating expenses. Our inability to raise additional financing or the terms of any financing we do raise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe market for our products in the network provider market is still emerging and our growth may be harmed if network operators do not adopt DPI solutions.\nThe market for DPI technology is still emerging and the majority of our customers to date have been small and midsize network operators. We believe that the Tier 1 network operators present a significant market opportunity and are an important element of our long term strategy, but they are still in the early stages of adopting and evaluating the benefits and applications of DPI technology. Network operators may decide that full visibility into their networks or highly granular control over content based applications is not critical to their business. They may also determine that certain applications, such as voice-over Internet protocol, or VoIP, or Internet video, can be adequately prioritized in their networks by using router and switch infrastructure products without the use of DPI technology. They may also, in some instances, face regulatory constraints that could change the characteristics of the markets. Network operators may also seek an embedded DPI solution in capital equipment devices such as routers rather than the stand-alone solution offered by us. Furthermore, widespread adoption of our products by network operators will require that they migrate to a new business model based on offering subscriber and application-based tiered services. If network operators decide not to adopt DPI technology, our market opportunity would be reduced and our growth rate may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the bandwidth management solutions market fails to grow, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe believe that the market for bandwidth management solutions is in an early stage of development. We cannot accurately predict the future size of the market, the products needed to address the market, the optimal distribution strategy, or the competitive environment that will develop. In order for us to execute our strategy, our potential customers must recognize the value of more sophisticated bandwidth management solutions, decide to invest in the management of their networks and the performance of important business software applications and, in particular, adopt our bandwidth management solutions. The growth of the bandwidth management solutions market also depends upon a number of factors, including the availability of inexpensive bandwidth, especially in international markets, and the growth of wide area networks. The failure of the market to rapidly grow would adversely affect our sales and sales prospects, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and cause a decline in the price of our common stock.\nDemand for our products depends, in part, on the rate of adoption of bandwidth-intensive broadband applications, such as peer-to-peer, and latency-sensitive applications, such as VoIP, Internet video and online video gaming applications.\nOur products are used by broadband service providers and enterprises to provide awareness, control and protection of Internet traffic by examining and identifying packets of data as they pass an inspection point in the network, particularly bandwidth-intensive applications that cause congestion in broadband networks and impact the quality of experience of users. In addition to the general increase in applications delivered over broadband networks that require large amounts of bandwidth, such as peer-to-peer applications, demand for our products is driven particularly by the growth in applications which are highly sensitive to network delays and therefore require efficient network management. These applications include VoIP, Internet video and online video gaming applications. If the rapid growth in adoption of VoIP and in the popularity of Internet video and online video gaming applications does not continue, the demand for our products may not grow as anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe network equipment market is subject to rapid technological progress and, to remain competitive, we must continually introduce new products or upgrades that achieve broad market acceptance.\nThe network equipment market is characterized by rapid technological progress, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. If we do not regularly introduce new products or upgrades in this dynamic environment, our product lines may become less competitive or obsolete. Developments in routers and routing software could also significantly reduce demand for our products. Alternative technologies could achieve widespread market acceptance and displace the technology on which we have based our product architecture. We cannot assure you that our chosen technological approaches will achieve broad market acceptance or that other technology or devices will not supplant our products and technology.\nOur products must comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations or else our products may not be widely accepted, which may prevent us from growing our net revenue or achieving profitability.\nThe market for network equipment products is characterized by the need to support new standards as they emerge, evolve and achieve acceptance. We will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new products and product enhancements that meet these emerging standards. We may not be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards. Our products must be compliant with various United States federal government requirements and regulations and standards defined by agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, in addition to standards established by governmental authorities in various foreign countries and recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union. If we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or if we fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates, we will not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply, which may prevent us from sustaining our net revenue or maintaining profitability.\nRecently adopted regulatory actions may result in reduced capital spending by U.S. broadband service providers, which could adversely impact our opportunities for continued revenue growth.\nOn January 14, 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Verizon v. FCC, struck down major portions of the \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules adopted by the FCC in December 2010 governing the operating practices of U.S. broadband service providers. The FCC originally designed the rules to ensure an \u201copen Internet\u201d and included three key requirements for U.S. broadband service providers: (1) a prohibition on preventing end-user customers from accessing lawful content or running applications of their choice over the Internet and from connecting and using devices that do not harm the network; (2) a requirement to treat lawful content, applications and services in a nondiscriminatory manner; and (3) a transparency requirement compelling the disclosure of network management policies. The court struck down the anti-blocking and nondiscrimination provisions of the rules but upheld the transparency requirement. The court also found that the FCC has the statutory authority to impose such rules so long as they do not contravene other express statutory mandates. On May 15, 2014, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposed new rules regarding anti-blocking and nondiscrimination, or Open Access NPRM, and sought public comment on whether and by how much the FCC should tighten regulation of Internet service providers. On February 26, 2015, the FCC broadly adopted the new rules pursuant to the Open Access NPRM, although, as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the exact language of the adopted order has not been published. The FCC justified its legal authority to adopt the new rules by, among other things, reclassifying broadband Internet access as a common carrier service subject to the FCC\u2019s general authority under Title II of the Communications Act and relying on Section 706 of the Telecommunication Act of 1996. The new rules do not go into effect immediately. The FCC must release the order and publish the rules in the Federal Register, and it will not be effective until 60 days after the publication. The new rules adopted by the FCC are likely to be challenged in court, and there is no certainty as to how a court will rule. Any rules or legislative actions ultimately adopted under the banner of \u201cnet neutrality\u201d could interfere with U.S. broadband service providers\u2019 ability to reasonably manage and invest in their U.S. broadband networks, and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing broadband service. As a result, U.S. broadband service providers may lessen their capital investments in their networks and we may have fewer opportunities to sell our products to both current and prospective customers, and our opportunity for continued revenue growth could be adversely impacted. In addition, the new rules adopted by the FCC could influence net neutrality rulemaking by international regulatory bodies, further affecting our opportunity for revenue growth. If our revenue growth slows or our revenues decrease, our results of operations and our financial condition also may be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price is likely to continue to be highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. The market for small cap technology companies, including us, has been particularly volatile in recent years. We cannot assure stockholders that our stock will trade at the same levels of other stocks in our industry or that, in general, stocks in our industry will sustain their current market prices.\nFactors that could cause such volatility may include, among other things:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 announcements of technology innovations by our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 conditions or trends in the network control and management industry;\n\u00b7 the acceptance by institutional investors of our stock;\n\u00b7 rumors, announcements or press articles regarding our operations, management, organization, financial condition or financial statements; or\n\u00b7 the gain or loss of a significant customer.\nThe stock market in general, and the market prices of stocks of technology companies, in particular, have experienced extreme price volatility that has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If we do not establish and maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management team that our stockholders may consider favorable or otherwise have the potential to impact our stockholders\u2019 ability to control our Company.\nDelaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of preserving our current management or may impact our stockholders\u2019 ability to control our Company, such as:\n\u00b7 authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock, without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u00b7 eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7 restricting the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent, which requires stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7 prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.\nMoreover, these provisions could allow our Board of Directors to affect your rights as a stockholder since our Board of Directors can make it more difficult for common stockholders to replace members of the Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace our current management team. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and may impact the rights of common stockholders. All of the foregoing could adversely impact the price of our common stock and your rights as a stockholder.\nHolders of our common stock may be diluted in the future.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 32.5 million shares of common stock and 15.0 million shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without seeking stockholder approval, to issue additional shares of common stock and/or preferred stock in the future for such consideration as our Board of Directors may consider sufficient. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Vineyard, we issued an aggregate of 825,060 shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of Vineyard. If we were to issue equity securities as all or part of the purchase price for any future acquisitions, the issuance of such equity securities would have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders.

Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our bylaws. This choice-of-forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our bylaws inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe do not pay and do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends.
