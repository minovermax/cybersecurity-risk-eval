{"cik": "783412", "company": "DAILY JOURNAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-12-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe foregoing business discussion and the other information included in this Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with the following risks, trends and uncertainties, any of which, either individually or in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nRisks Associated with Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic\nThe Company\u2019s business is likely to be materially and adversely affected by an epidemic or pandemic such as COVID-19, or by a similar event or the fear of such an event, and the measures that governmental authorities implement to address it.\nAs COVID-19 began to spread in March and April 2020, and again more recently, governmental authorities and health officials implemented numerous unprecedented measures to contain the virus, including \u201cstay at home\u201d orders for non-essential workers, travel restrictions, quarantines and business shutdowns. Most of Journal Technologies\u2019 customers, which are primarily courts and governmental agencies in the United States, Canada and Australia, either closed or significantly scaled back their activities. Similarly, many law firms and companies from which the Traditional Business derives advertising and subscription revenues also curtailed their operations and spending.\nThe impact on economic activity of these actions or similar actions in the future are likely to significantly impact the Traditional Business\u2019 advertising and subscription revenues. The trend of working from home and using on-line services is also likely to put additional pressure on the newspaper business by impacting circulation numbers that may not be replaced by on-line revenues. Actions restricting travel, requiring non-essential workers to \u201cstay at home\u201d or causing courts and justice agencies to close or cut back operations can impact the ability of Journal Technologies to complete certain projects that are typically done in-person (and for which payment is usually received upon completion), reduce efiling revenues, affect procurement processes and result in overall payment delays. In addition, the Company relies on its portfolio of marketable securities for dividend income and balance sheet support, and the value of the portfolio can be materially affected by declines in stock prices, particularly among the common stocks of the three U.S. financial institutions and one foreign manufacturer that make up a substantial portion of the portfolio.\nDue to the uncertainties associated with the duration and severity of an event like COVID-19, the efforts to contain it, and the changes in business operations and personal behaviors that are likely to follow from it, it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of its impact on the Company\u2019s business in future periods, but it could materially affect the Company\u2019s operations, staffing levels, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows going forward. Also, while the vast majority of the Company\u2019s employees are currently working from home effectively, a resurgence in serious COVID-19 infections could cause the Company to experience a lack of availability of employees to perform key job functions at particular points in time.\nRisks Associated with the Traditional Business\nChanges in the legal requirement to publish public notice advertising or in the legal ability of our newspapers to publish those notices would have a significant adverse impact on The Traditional Business.\nFrom time to time, the legislatures in California and Arizona (and elsewhere) have considered various proposals that would result in the elimination or reduction of the amount of public notice advertising in printed newspapers required by statute, and Arizona approved one such proposal for a particular notice type in fiscal 2017. These proposals typically focus on the availability of alternative means of providing public notices, such as via the Internet. Some proposals also question the need for public notices at all. To the extent these proposals become law, particularly in California and Arizona, they could materially affect the revenues of The Traditional Business.\nIn addition, if the adjudication, which is what gives publishers the legal ability to publish public notice advertising, of one or more of the Company\u2019s newspapers were challenged and revoked, those newspapers would no longer be eligible to publish public notice advertising, and it could materially affect the revenues of The Traditional Business.\nThe Traditional Business faces strong competition in each of its markets.\nCompetition for readers and advertisers is very intense, both from established publications and from new entrants into the market. The Daily Journals face aggressive competition. The Company\u2019s court rules publications face competition in both Northern and Southern California from document management programs, online court rules services, and the courts themselves. The steady decline in recent years in the number of subscriptions to The Daily Journals and the court rule publications is likely to continue and adversely impact The Traditional Business\u2019 future revenues.\nThe Traditional Business also competes with serious competitors for public notice advertising in all of its markets. As the amount of this advertising has decreased due to the reduction in the number of foreclosures discussed above, the competition to publish the remaining public notices has intensified and may result in a further decline in The Traditional Business\u2019 public notice advertising revenues.\nThe Traditional Business continues to experience challenges in maintaining its commercial advertising and circulation revenues, particularly due to the growth of Internet sites.\nInternet sites devoted to recruitment have become significant competitors of our newspapers and websites for classified advertising. In addition, there has been a steady consolidation of companies serving the legal marketplace, resulting in an ever-smaller group of companies placing display advertising. Furthermore, newspapers like ours have been struggling to compete for display advertising generally, given the many other forums (including Internet sites) that compete for advertising dollars. These trends are expected to continue and would adversely affect The Traditional Business. The Company has contracted with a third-party agency to sell display advertising for the Company.\nCirculation revenues have continued to decline as more and more information has become available online. Law firm mergers have also reduced the number of firms that purchase multiple subscriptions of our newspapers. It is not practical to assume that we will be able to offset the decline in subscriptions with increases in the subscription rate, and we expect that our circulation revenues will continue to decline.\nThe Traditional Business is exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in postage and paper costs.\nAfter personnel costs, postage and paper costs are typically the Company\u2019s next two largest expenses. An adequate supply of newsprint and other paper is important to the operations of The Traditional Business. The Company currently does not have a contract with any paper supplier, and in the past, shortages of newsprint have sometimes resulted in higher prices. Recently, there have been consolidations of newsprint suppliers, and paper prices may fluctuate substantially in the future.\nThe Traditional Business uses the U.S. Postal Service for distribution of a majority of its newspapers and products. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service and on legislative mandates imposed upon the U.S. Postal Service. During the past several years, postal rates have increased. Postal rates and fees may increase more in the future. Further, we may not be able to pass on increases in paper and postage costs to our customers.\nRisks Associated with Journal Technologies\nThe success of Journal Technologies depends in large part on the technological update and upgrade of its software products.\nJournal Technologies\u2019 success depends on the continued improvement of its products, and the costs to update and upgrade those products consistently represent a large portion of Journal Technologies\u2019 expenses. There are many uncertainties in the process of courts and other justice agencies migrating to newer case management systems, including whether Journal Technologies\u2019 versions of these systems will find general acceptance and whether the modification of such systems can be done in a cost effective manner. The costs to update and upgrade Journal Technologies\u2019 products are expensed as incurred and will impact earnings at least through the foreseeable future.\nJournal Technologies faces significant competition from other case management software vendors.\nThere is significant competition among a limited number of companies to provide services and software to courts and other justice agencies, and some of these companies are much larger and have greater access to capital and other resources than Journal Technologies. Normally, the vendor is selected through a bidding process, and often the customers will express a preference for, or even require, larger vendors. An inability to successfully compete in this difficult market could materially affect the earnings of Journal Technologies.\nThe customers of Journal Technologies are public sector entities, which create special issues and risks.\nAlmost all of the customers of Journal Technologies are courts, justice agencies, and other government entities. Accordingly, we face special risks associated with governmental budget constraints, especially during stressful economic times, which could force government entities to defer or forego consulting services or even stop paying their annual software license and maintenance fees. In addition, we encounter risks related to a longer and more complicated sales cycle than exists for commercial customers, political issues related to resource allocation, administration turnover and preferences for internal case management solutions or for a particular vendor, complicated bidding procedures, and fluctuations in the demand for information technology products and services.\nJournal Technologies generally recognizes revenues for software installations only upon completion of the applicable services and customer acceptance of the software system.\nIn most cases, installation fees are not due until the customer has indicated its satisfaction with the installed system, and it has \u201cgone live\u201d. Accordingly, we do not recognize revenues for installation services or for most other consulting services until after the services have been performed and accepted. There are significant risks associated with our ability to complete our services to the satisfaction of our customers and to fulfill the requirements that entitle us to be paid. An inability to realize payment for services performed could materially affect the earnings of Journal Technologies.\nRisks Associated with Our Holdings of Marketable Securities\nA large portion of the Company\u2019s assets is held in publicly traded securities, and the prices of those securities may decline.\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company held marketable securities worth approximately $347,573,000, with an unrealized gain for financial statement purposes of $244,093,000. While this portfolio has enabled the Company to borrow on very favorable terms for acquisitions and to better compete for case management software opportunities that are usually limited to \u201clarge\u201d firms, it is unusual for a public company to invest a significant amount of its available cash in the marketable securities of other public companies. The value of these securities could decline, which would adversely affect net income and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nAlso, as of September 30, 2021, the Company\u2019s holdings of marketable securities were concentrated in just seven companies. Accordingly, a significant decline in the market value of one or more of the Company\u2019s holdings may not be offset by hypothetically better performance of other holdings. This concentration of risk may result in a more pronounced effect on net income and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nThe Company is required to recognize losses in a particular security for financial statement purposes even though the Company has not actually sold the security.\nUnder accounting rules that became effective in fiscal 2019, changes in the unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in the Company\u2019s reported net income (loss), even though the Company has not actually realized any gain or loss by selling such marketable securities. Accordingly, changes in the market prices of the Company\u2019s marketable securities can have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s reported results for a particular period, even though those changes do not bear on the performance of the Company\u2019s operating businesses.\nThe Company may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates for marketable securities that are not denominated in the United States Dollar.\nAt times, the Company may hold marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the United States Dollar. When it does, the Company may be at risk for significant fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates, which would affect the profitability of such marketable securities. The Company currently owns one such investment that is denominated in Hong Kong Dollar.\nGeneral Corporate Risks\nThe Company relies heavily on the services of Gerald Salzman.\nGerald Salzman, 82, serves as the Company\u2019s president, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, treasurer and assistant secretary. He is also the president, chief executive officer, chief financial officer and secretary of Journal Technologies. Although Mr. Salzman has started transitioning and delegating certain of his duties to other managers, a sudden loss of Mr. Salzman\u2019s services would be challenging for the Company given the number of roles he fills for both The Traditional Business and Journal Technologies.\nChanges in accounting guidance could have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s reported financial results.\nPreparing consolidated financial statements requires the Company\u2019s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u2019s application of accounting policies and the prevailing accounting guidance. The Company considers fair value measurement and disclosures, revenue recognition, accounting for software costs and income taxes to be critical accounting policies and estimates. A change in the accounting guidance with respect to one or more of these areas could materially affect the Company\u2019s reported financial results.\nAs noted above, beginning in fiscal 2019, changes in unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities are included in the Company\u2019s net income (loss) and thus may have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s reported results depending on the fluctuations of the prices of the marketable securities owned by the Company.\nWe cannot be sure that customer information and systems are fully protected against security breaches.\nJournal Technologies\u2019 software processes and stores customer information in the conduct of its business, including in some cases by utilizing cloud-based systems supplied by third-party vendors. Despite our efforts to maintain up-to-date security controls, it is possible that our system could be improperly used to access or misappropriate customer systems or information, including personally identifiable or other confidential information. A material security breach of this nature could harm our reputation, cause us to lose current and potential customers, require us to allocate more resources to information security, or subject us or our customers to liability, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue, or both. The Traditional Business also operates certain websites that process and, in certain cases, store customer information. A minor security breach was discovered on a website operated by The Traditional Business in early fiscal 2015, and although it was remediated, there can be no assurance that there will not be more material breaches in the future. Also, our insurance may not cover all of the costs that we may incur as a result of a material security breach.\nThe Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting has been designed to provide management and the Board of Directors with reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. As a small company, we are not able to segregate duties to the extent we could if we had more people, and we have not sufficiently designed controls that support an effective assessment of our internal controls relating to the prevention of fraud and possible management override of controls. Further, the Company does not have an internal audit group, and has not engaged an outside firm to complete the documentation of its internal control assessment to the level required by the applicable criteria.\nWe believe that our overall internal control environment is sufficient for a company of our size. However, the existence of material weaknesses means that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we are not able to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely way, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms will be adversely affected. Such a result could negatively impact the market price and trading liquidity of our stock, weaken investor confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 10355, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "DJCO"}
