Risk Factors.\nFactors and Risks That May Affect Future Results\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, among others, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. Any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also impair our operations and business.\nWe have incurred significant net losses in the past, we do not have sufficient financing to continue our operations for the coming twelve months and we may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our company.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since our inception. Our net loss was $116,000 and $106,000 for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2015 and February 28, 2014, respectively. Our accumulated deficit since our inception in 1992 was $28,309,000 at February 28, 2015. At February 28, 2015 we had approximately $12,000 of cash and a working capital deficit and shareholders\u2019 deficit of approximately ($1,128,000). Our available cash and working capital at February 28, 2015 is clearly insufficient to fund our planned operations for the coming twelve months, even with our reduced use of cash. As a result of our limited cash resources, our auditors have indicated in their report on our financial statements included herein that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We presently have no commitments for financing and cannot assure investors that we will be successful in obtaining financing. Any equity financing would be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient financing, we may be forced to cease all activities and liquidate.\nWe may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to raise capital, settle liabilities and to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and, in the case of a business combination, would likely cause a change in control of our ownership.\nOur certificate of incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of up to 120,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and we only have outstanding 1,176,373 class A common shares and 2,956 class B common shares. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock or any number of shares of our preferred stock in connection with a reverse merger transaction or to raise cash or settle liabilities:\n\u00b7\nwould significantly reduce the equity interest of current shareholders;\n\u00b7\nwill likely cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and most likely also result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u00b7\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nManagement intends to devote only a limited amount of time to seeking a business combination which may adversely impact our ability to identify and consummate a successful business combination.\nOur ability to successfully effect a business combination will be dependent upon the efforts of our management and Board members. Each of these individuals is involved in other business activities, has no employment agreement with our company and intends to devote only a limited amount of time to the business of our company. Other than our Chief Financial Officer, who is compensated on a part-time consulting basis (but is not being paid currently), none of our board or management members receives cash compensation for their services. Due to the lack of cash, the Company has been unable to pay the cash compensation accruing to our Chief Financial Officer during the eight fiscal years ended February 28, 2015. Accordingly, our ability to identify and consummate a successful business combination may be adversely affected by a lack of time commitment by management.\nBecause of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, we may not be able to consummate a business combination with suitable growth potential.\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from other entities seeking to merge an operating business into a public company. In addition to competition from other companies like ours with very limited resources, we expect competition from public companies that have raised significant money for a reverse merger, venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess far greater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe that there are numerous potential target businesses with which we could merge, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses will be limited by our lack of available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Further, should we be required or elect to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or likely capitalization issues related thereto, it may delay the consummation of a transaction and may further reduce our resources.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing that may be needed to fund the operations and/or growth of the target business; the recent economic stress and credit conditions and additional regulations make this even more difficult.\nIf the target business with which we merge requires capital in order to execute its business plan, we will be required to seek additional financing. We cannot assure you that such financing would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular business combination, we would be compelled to restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, if we consummate a business combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business.\nStock, Stockholder and Charter Related Risks\nOur significant shareholder and executive officers and directors may be able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur principal shareholder, MALLC, beneficially owns approximately 51% of our outstanding voting power and our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately 15.8% of our outstanding voting power (also see Item 10. Executive Compensation Employment/Consulting Agreements). Two of our directors and our Secretary/Treasurer serve as sole managers of MALLC, with the ability to vote and dispose of our shares owned by that company by majority vote. Because of its high level of stock ownership, and the Board and management representation in its voting power, MALLC, or MALLC and the executive officers and directors, will be able to influence all of our affairs and actions including matters requiring shareholder approval.\nThere is a potential conflict of interest between management\u2019s duty to protect all shareholders and their duty as managers of Magna Acquisition LLC to protect MALLC\u2019s interest.\nTwo of our directors and our Secretary/Treasurer are managers of MALLC. There could be situations where the interests of MALLC are different than the interests of all shareholders and management would be faced with a potential conflict of interest in such situations.\nSales of control shares may depress the price of our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock by shareholders in the public market, or even the potential for such sales, are likely to adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital by selling equity securities.\nWe currently have 1,179,373 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, of which 607,727 shares are held by an affiliate of the Company (MALLC), and the majority of the balance of which are freely tradable. The shares held by MALLC are deemed \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201ccontrol\u201d securities, as such terms are defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As such, those shares may be sold in the future only pursuant to registration under the Securities Act or an exemption such as Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, some of these securities are currently eligible for sale in the public market and the balance will become eligible for sale in the public market beginning one year following the cessation of our \u201cshell\u201d company status pursuant to consummation of a business combination and our filing of required public disclosure in connection therewith, provided in each case that the seller, so long as it remains an affiliate of the Company, complies with the volume limitations of that rule. The market price of our common stock could drop significantly if the holder of these securities sells them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.\nOur common stock price has fluctuated considerably, has limited trading volume and may not appreciate in value.\nOur shares are traded on the OTCQB under the symbol \u201cMAGAA.\u201d Trading in our shares has generally been inactive. The absence of an active trading market reduces the liquidity of an investment in our shares. The market price for our shares has been and is likely to be very volatile. Numerous factors beyond our control may have a significant adverse effect on prices. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation. If we were the object of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.\nOur corporate charter contains authorized, unissued preferred stock which may be issued with terms that dilute voting and other rights of common stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences that may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue a new series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, our common shareholders. The issuance of a new series of preferred stock could be used in certain circumstances as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us.\nShareholders may not be able to recover damages from our directors and executive officers for actions taken.\nOur certificate of incorporation includes provisions which eliminate the personal liability of our directors and executive officers to the extent permitted by applicable law. As a result, shareholders may be unable to recover damages against our directors and executive officers for actions taken by them which constitute negligence or a violation of some of their fiduciary duties.\nRisks associated with the historical cardiac diagnostic business\nWe have ceased all activities with respect to our cardiac diagnostic business. For a detailed description of the risks relating to our former cardiac diagnostic business, see our annual report on Form 10-KSB filing for the year ended February 29, 2004.", "PERMNO": 78983, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "MAGAA"}
