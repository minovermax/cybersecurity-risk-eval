{"cik": "809248", "company": "CARROLS RESTAURANT GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information and data included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIntense competition in the restaurant industry could make it more difficult to profitably expand our business and could also have a negative impact on our operating results if customers favor our competitors or we are forced to change our pricing and other marketing strategies.\nThe restaurant industry is highly competitive. In each of our markets, our restaurants compete with a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, as well as locally owned restaurants, offering low and medium-priced fare. We also compete with other convenience stores, delicatessens and prepared food counters in grocery stores, supermarkets, cafeterias and other purveyors of moderately priced and quickly prepared food. We believe our largest competitors for our Burger King restaurants are McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s restaurants and the largest competitors for our Popeyes restaurants are KFC and Chick-fil-A.\nDue to competitive conditions, we, as well as certain of the other major quick-service restaurant chains, have offered select food items and combination meals at discounted prices. These pricing and marketing strategies have had, and in the future may have, a negative impact on our sales discounts and earnings.\nFactors applicable to the quick-service restaurant segment may adversely affect our results of operations, which may cause a decrease in earnings and revenues.\nThe quick-service restaurant segment can be materially adversely affected by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in local, regional or national economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in demographic trends;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer tastes;\n\u2022\nchanges in traffic patterns;\n\u2022\nincreases in fuel prices and utility costs;\n\u2022\nconsumer concerns about health, diet and nutrition;\n\u2022\nincreases in the number of, and particular locations of, competing restaurants;\n\u2022\nchanges in discretionary consumer spending;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of food, such as beef, chicken, produce and packaging;\n\u2022\nincreased labor costs, including healthcare, unemployment insurance and minimum wage requirements;\n\u2022\nthe availability of experienced management and hourly-paid employees;\n\u2022\nhealth concerns such as the recent outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19); and\n\u2022\nregional weather conditions.\nWe are highly dependent on the Burger King and Popeyes systems and our ability to renew our franchise agreements with BKC and PLK. The failure to renew our franchise agreements or Burger King's or Popeyes' failure to compete effectively would materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nDue to the nature of franchising and our agreements with BKC and PLK, our success is, to a large extent, directly related to the success of the Burger King and Popeyes system including their financial condition, advertising programs, product development, overall quality of operations and the successful and consistent operation of Burger King and Popeyes restaurants owned by other franchisees. We cannot assure you that Burger King or Popeyes restaurants will be able to compete effectively with other restaurants. As a result, any failure of the Burger King or Popeyes franchise systems to compete effectively would likely have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nUnder each of our franchise agreements, we are required to comply with operational programs established by BKC or PLK. For example, our franchise agreements with BKC and PLK require that our restaurants comply with specified design criteria. In addition, BKC generally has the right to require us during the tenth year of a franchise agreement to remodel our restaurants to conform to the then-current image of Burger King restaurants, and PLK generally has the right to require us to remodel our restaurants to conform to the then-current image of the Popeyes restaurants every six years, all of which may require the expenditure of considerable funds. We may not be able to avoid adopting menu price discount promotions or permanent menu price decreases instituted by BKC or PLK that may be unprofitable.\nOur BKC franchise agreements typically have a 20-year term after which BKC\u2019s consent is required to receive a successor franchise agreement. Our PLK franchise agreements typically have a 20-year term after which we have the options to (a) renew for a 10 year renewal term and (b) renew for a second supplemental renewal term of 10 years provided that we meet certain conditions as set forth in the PLK franchise agreements.\nWe cannot assure you that BKC will grant each of our future requests for successor franchise agreements or that we will exercise any of the options to renew the PLK franchise agreements. Any failure of BKC to renew our franchise agreements could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, as a condition of approval of a successor franchise agreement, BKC may require us to make capital improvements to particular restaurants to bring them up to current image standards established by Burger King, which may require us to incur substantial costs. Additionally, one of the conditions to our exercise of the options to renew our PLK franchise agreements is that we must make capital\nimprovements to particular restaurants to bring them up to current image standards established by Popeyes, which may require us to incur substantial costs.\nIn addition, our franchise agreements with BKC and PLK do not give us exclusive rights to operate Burger King or Popeyes restaurants in any defined territory. We cannot assure you that franchises granted by BKC or PLK to third parties will not adversely affect any restaurants that we operate.\nAdditionally, as a franchisee, we have no control over the Burger King brand or the Popeyes brand. If BKC and PLK do not adequately protect the Burger King and Popeyes brands and other intellectual property, our competitive position and operating results could be harmed.\nOur strategy includes pursuing acquisitions of additional Burger King and Popeyes restaurants and we may not find Burger King restaurants or Popeyes restaurants that are suitable acquisition candidates or successfully operate or integrate any Burger King restaurants or Popeyes restaurants that we may acquire.\nAs part of our strategy, we intend to selectively pursue the acquisition of additional Burger King and Popeyes restaurants. Pursuant to the ADA, BKC assigned to us its right of first refusal under its franchise agreements with its franchisees to purchase all of the assets of a Burger King restaurant or all or substantially all of the voting stock of the franchisee, whether direct or indirect, on the same terms proposed between such franchisee and a third party purchaser in 16 states as follows: Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia (subject to certain exceptions for certain limited geographic areas within certain states) and a limited number of counties in four additional states and granted us franchise pre-approval to acquire Burger King restaurants from Burger King franchisees until we acquire more than 500 Burger King restaurants. In addition, we assumed a development agreement for Popeyes\u00ae, which includes a right of first refusal for acquisitions in two southern states.\nCompetition for acquisition candidates may exist or increase in the future. Consequently, there may be fewer acquisition opportunities available to us at an attractive acquisition price. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, manage or successfully integrate additional restaurants without substantial costs, delays or operational or financial problems. In the event we are able to acquire additional restaurants, the integration and operation of the acquired restaurants may place significant demands on our management, which could adversely affect our ability to manage our existing restaurants. We may be required to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on acceptable terms or at all. Our Senior Credit Facilities contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from incurring additional debt to acquire additional Burger King or Popeyes restaurants.\nThe continued assignment of the ADA ROFR is subject to suspension at the discretion of BKC in the event of non-compliance by Carrols LLC with the new restaurant development and restaurant remodel obligations and certain other terms in the ADA. For 2020, we have reduced our planned spending for new restaurant development and the remodeling of restaurants below the requirements in the ADA. In the event we do not meet our new restaurant development and/or restaurant remodel requirements in the ADA, BKC may elect to suspend the ADA ROFR. In the case of a suspension of the ADA ROFR by BKC, any benefits available to us from the ADA may be suspended until such time that we are in compliance with the terms of the ADA.\nWe could be adversely affected by health concerns such as the current outbreak of the coronavirus(COVID-19), food-borne illnesses, as well as widespread negative publicity regarding food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns.\nNegative publicity about food quality, illness and injury or other health concerns (including health implications of obesity) or similar issues stemming from one restaurant or a number of restaurants could materially adversely affect us, regardless of whether they pertain to our own restaurants, other Burger King and Popeyes restaurants or to restaurants owned or operated by other companies. For example, health concerns about the consumption of beef, chicken or eggs or by specific events such as the outbreak of \u201cmad cow\u201d or \u201cswine flu\u201d diseases either domestically or internationally could lead to changes in consumer preferences, reduce consumption of our products and adversely affect our financial performance. These events could also reduce available supply or significantly raise the price of beef, chicken or eggs.\nIn addition, we cannot guarantee that our operational controls and employee training will be effective in preventing food-borne illnesses, food tampering and other food safety issues that may affect our restaurants. Food-borne illness or food tampering incidents could be caused by customers, employees or food suppliers and transporters and, therefore,\ncould be outside of our control. Any publicity relating to health concerns or the perceived or specific outbreaks of food-borne illnesses, food tampering or other food safety issues attributed to one or more of our restaurants, could result in a significant decrease in guest traffic in all of our restaurants and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, similar publicity or occurrences with respect to other restaurants or restaurant chains could also decrease our guest traffic and have a similar material adverse effect on our business.\nAdditionally, the United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as the current outbreak of the coronavirus(COVID-19), norovirus, Avian Flu or \u201cSARS,\u201d or H1N1. If a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or customers may become infected, or may choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places, any of which may adversely affect our restaurant customer traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants, receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level. We also may be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations. Even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business.\nA health pandemic (such as the coronavirus(COVID-19)) is a disease outbreak that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time. Our restaurants are places where people can gather together for human connection. Customers might avoid public gathering places in the event of a health pandemic, and local, regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease. The impact of a health pandemic on us might be disproportionately greater than on other quick-service concepts that have lower customer traffic and that depend less on the gathering of people.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating restaurants acquired by us into our existing business.\nThe acquisition of a significant number of restaurants involves the integration of those acquired restaurants with our existing business. The difficulties of integration include:\n\u2022\ncoordinating and consolidating geographically separated systems and facilities;\n\u2022\nintegrating the management and personnel of the acquired restaurants, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;\n\u2022\nimplementing our management information systems; and\n\u2022\nimplementing operational procedures and disciplines to control costs and increase profitability.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the acquisition of restaurants and integration of acquired restaurants\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of additional restaurants will depend in part upon whether we can integrate any acquired restaurants in an efficient and effective manner. We may not accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully. If management is unable to successfully integrate acquired restaurants, the anticipated financial contribution of the acquisition may not be realized.\nIn our evaluation of our recent and potential acquisitions, assumptions are made as to our ability to increase sales as well as improve restaurant-level profitability particularly in the areas of food, labor and cash controls as well as other operating expenses. If we are not able to make such improvements in these operational areas as planned, the acquired restaurants\u2019 targeted profitability levels will be affected which could cause an adverse effect on our overall financial results and financial condition.\nThe combined companies may not realize the anticipated benefits from the Cambridge Acquisition.\nThe Cambridge Acquisition involved the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently. We expect the combined companies to result in financial and operational benefits, including increased cost savings and other financial and operating benefits. There can be no assurance, however, regarding when or the extent to which the combined companies will be able to realize these increased cost savings or benefits. The companies have integrated or, in some cases, replaced numerous systems, including those involving restaurant-level operational data, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll and regulatory compliance\ninformation, many of which were dissimilar. In 2020, the management of the restaurants acquired in 2019 will continue to include training for restaurant-level managers and team members to best utilize these integrated systems to improve operating results. The lack of effectiveness of utilizing the integrated systems and processes could have a material adverse effect on the combined companies and the market price of our common stock.\nWe may incur significant liability or reputational harm if claims are brought against us or the Burger King and Popeyes brands.\nWe may be subject to complaints, regulatory proceedings or litigation from guests or other persons alleging food-related illness, injuries suffered in our premises or other food quality, health or operational concerns, including environmental claims. In addition, in recent years a number of restaurant companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging, among other things, violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage, rest break, meal break and overtime compensation issues and, in the case of quick-service restaurants, alleging that they have failed to disclose the health risks associated with high fat or high sodium foods and that their marketing practices have encouraged obesity. We may also be subject to litigation or other actions initiated by governmental authorities or our employees, among others, based upon these and other matters. Adverse publicity resulting from such allegations or occurrences or alleged discrimination or other operating issues stemming from one or a number of our locations could adversely affect our business, regardless of whether the allegations are true, or whether we are ultimately held liable. Any cases filed against us could materially adversely affect us if we lose such cases and have to pay substantial damages or if we settle such cases. In addition, any such cases may materially and adversely affect our operations by increasing our litigation costs and diverting our attention and resources to address such actions. In addition, if a claim is successful, our insurance coverage may not cover or be adequate to cover all liabilities or losses and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance, or to obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. If we suffer losses, liabilities or loss of income in excess of our insurance coverage or if our insurance does not cover such loss, liability or loss of income, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in consumer taste could negatively impact our business.\nWe obtain a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of hamburgers, fried chicken and various types of sandwiches. If consumer preferences for these types of foods change, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. The quick-service restaurant segment is characterized by the frequent introduction of new products, often supported by substantial promotional campaigns, and is subject to changing consumer preferences, tastes, and eating and purchasing habits. Our success depends on BKC\u2019s and PLK's ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences, tastes and dining and purchasing habits, as well as other factors affecting the restaurant industry, including new market entrants and demographic changes. BKC or PLK may be forced to make changes to our menu items in order to respond to changes in consumer tastes or dining patterns, and we may lose customers who do not prefer the new menu items. In recent years, numerous companies in the quick-service restaurant segments have introduced products positioned to capitalize on the growing consumer preference for food products that are, or are perceived to be, promoting good health, nutritious, low in calories, low in fat content or plant-based. If BKC or PLK does not continually develop and successfully introduce new menu offerings that appeal to changing consumer preferences or if the Burger King and Popeyes franchise systems do not timely develop new products, our operating results could suffer. In addition, any significant event that adversely affects consumption of our products, such as cost, changing tastes or health concerns, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf a significant disruption in service or supply by any of our suppliers or distributors were to occur, it could create disruptions in the operations of our restaurants, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur financial performance depends on our continuing ability to offer fresh, quality food at competitive prices. If a significant disruption in service or supply by our suppliers or distributors were to occur, it could create disruptions in the operations of our restaurants, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are a member of a national purchasing cooperative, Restaurant Services, Inc., which we refer to as \"RSI\", created for the Burger King system. RSI is a non-profit independent purchasing cooperative that is responsible for sourcing our products and related supplies and managing relationships with approved distributors for the Burger King system. We use our purchasing power to negotiate directly with certain other vendors, to obtain favorable pricing and terms for supplying our restaurants. For our Burger King restaurants, we are required to purchase all of our foodstuffs,\npaper goods and packaging materials from BKC-approved suppliers at prices negotiated by RSI. We currently utilize mostly three distributors, Maines Paper & Food Service, Inc., McLane Company Inc., and Reinhart Food Service L.L.C., to supply our Burger King restaurants with the majority of our foodstuffs. As of December 29, 2019, such distributors supplied 39%, 28% and 28%, respectively, of our Burger King restaurants.\nFor our Popeyes restaurants we are a member of a national purchasing cooperative, Supply Management Services, Inc. (\"SMS\"). SMS is a non-profit independent purchasing cooperative that is responsible for sourcing certain of our products and and managing relationships with approved distributors for the Popeyes system. Popeyes utilizes five distributors, two for poultry products and three for all other products. For our Popeyes restaurants, one distributor, Tyson Foods, supplies 75% of our poultry products. One distributor, Customized Distribution Services, Inc. supplies 61 of our Popeyes restaurants with all non-poultry products.\nIn the event any of our distributors or suppliers are unable to service us and we are unable to timely secure alternative sources for product this could lead to a disruption of service until a new distributor or supplier is engaged, which could have an adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common stock.\nIf labor costs increase, we may not be able to make a corresponding increase in our prices and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWage rates for a number of our employees are either at or slightly above the federal and or state minimum wage rates. As federal and/or state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wage rates of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to the employees at wage rates which are above the minimum wage, which will increase our costs. The extent to which we are not able to raise our prices to compensate for increases in wage rates, including increases in state unemployment insurance costs or other costs including mandated health insurance, this could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, even if minimum wage rates do not increase, we may still be required to raise wage rates in order to compete for an adequate supply of labor for our restaurants.\nHigher labor costs due to statutory and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe are subject to the federal labor laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, as well as various state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages, labor relations, workplace safety, citizenship requirements and other working conditions for employees. Federal, state and local laws may also require us to provide paid and unpaid leave, healthcare, sick time or other benefits to our employees. Changes in the law, or penalties associated with any failure on our part to comply with legal requirements, could increase our labor costs or result in additional expense.\nBeginning in 2018, certain workers were able to take up to eight weeks (increasing in New York and other areas to twelve weeks in 2021) of employer-provided paid leave for childbirth, care for a seriously ill family member or needs related to a family member\u2019s military deployment. These additional expenses may cause us to raise our prices. In certain geographic areas which cannot absorb such increases, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We provide unpaid leave for employees for covered family and medical reasons, including childbirth, to the extent required by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended, and applicable state laws. To the extent we need to hire additional employees or pay overtime to replace such employees on leave, this would be an added expense which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIncreases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreases in income tax rates in the United States or other changes in income tax laws in any particular jurisdiction could reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The United States recently made changes to existing tax laws in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Among its many provisions, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and imposed limitations on the deductibility of interest and certain other corporate deductions. Additional changes in the U.S. tax regime, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe efficiency and quality of our competitors\u2019 advertising and promotional programs and the extent and cost of our advertising could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our restaurants depends in part upon the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns and promotions by BKC or PLK. If our competitors increase spending on advertising and promotion, or the cost of television or radio advertising increases, or BKC\u2019s, PLK's, or our advertising and promotions are less effective than our competitors\u2019, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is regional and we therefore face risks related to reliance on certain markets as well as risks for other unforeseen events.\nAt December 29, 2019, 15% of our restaurants were located in North Carolina, 12% were located in New York, 12% were located in Tennessee, and 25% were located in Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. Therefore, the economic conditions, state and local government regulations, weather conditions or other conditions affecting New York, Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and North Carolina and other unforeseen events, including terrorism and other regional issues may have a material impact on the success of our restaurants in those locations.\nMany of our restaurants are located in regions that may be susceptible to severe weather conditions such as harsh winter weather and hurricanes. As a result, adverse weather conditions in any of these areas could damage these restaurants, result in fewer guest visits to these restaurants and otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe cannot assure you that the current locations of our restaurants will continue to be economically viable or that additional locations will be acquired at reasonable costs.\nThe location of our restaurants has significant influence on their success. We cannot assure you that current locations will continue to be economically viable or that additional locations can be acquired at reasonable costs. In addition, the economic environment where restaurants are located could decline in the future, which could result in reduced sales for those locations. We cannot assure you that new sites will be profitable or as profitable as existing sites.\nEconomic downturns may adversely impact consumer spending patterns.\nThe U.S. economy has in the past experienced significant slowdown and volatility due to uncertainties related to availability of credit, difficulties in the banking and financial services sectors, softness in the housing market, diminished market liquidity, falling consumer confidence and high unemployment rates. Our business is dependent to a significant extent on national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly those that affect our guests that frequently patronize our restaurants and the health of surrounding businesses who employ a significant amount of workers. In particular, where our customers\u2019 disposable income is reduced (such as by job losses, credit constraints and higher housing, tax, energy, interest or other costs) or where the perceived wealth of customers has decreased (because of circumstances such as lower residential real estate values, increased foreclosure rates, increased tax rates or other economic disruptions), our restaurants have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, lower sales and customer traffic as customers choose lower-cost alternatives or other alternatives to dining out. The resulting decrease in our customer traffic or average sales per transaction has had an adverse effect in the past, and could in the future have a material adverse effect, on our business.\nThe loss of the services of our senior management could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our senior management who have substantial experience in the restaurant industry. We believe that it could be difficult to replace our senior management with individuals having comparable experience. Consequently, the loss of the services of members of our senior management could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGovernment regulation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the development and operation of restaurants, including regulations relating to the following:\n\u2022\nzoning;\n\u2022\nrequirements relating to labeling of caloric and other nutritional information on menu boards, advertising and food packaging;\n\u2022\nthe preparation and sale of food;\n\u2022\nemployer/employee relationships, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, mandatory paid and unpaid leave, working and safety conditions, and citizenship requirements;\n\u2022\nhealth care; and\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws that prohibit discrimination and laws regulating design and operation of, and access to, facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.\nIn the event that legislation having a negative impact on our business is adopted, it could have a material adverse impact on us. For example, substantial increases in the minimum wage or state or Federal unemployment taxes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Local zoning or building codes or regulations can cause substantial delays in our ability to build and open new restaurants. Any failure to obtain and maintain required licenses, permits and approvals could also adversely affect our operating results.\nFederal, state and local environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials could expose us to liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous substances or other regulated materials, release of pollutants into the air, soil and water, and the remediation of contaminated sites.\nFailure to comply with environmental laws could result in the imposition of fines or penalties, restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts of law, as well as investigatory or remedial liabilities and claims for alleged personal injury or damages to property or natural resources. Some environmental laws impose strict, and under some circumstances joint and several, liability for costs of investigation and remediation of contaminated sites on current and prior owners or operators of the sites, as well as those entities that send regulated materials to the sites. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. Therefore, our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing property subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.\nThe leases for our restaurant locations (except for certain acquired restaurants which have an underlying lease term of less than 20 years) generally have initial terms of 20 years, and typically provide for renewal options in five year increments as well as for rent escalations. Generally, our leases are \u201cnet\u201d leases, which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. Additional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term non-cancelable leases. We generally cannot cancel our leases. If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be obligated to perform our monetary obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying all amounts due for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or any terms at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations.\nAn increase in food costs could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur profitability and operating margins are dependent in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs. Changes in the price or availability of certain food products could affect our ability to offer broad menu and price offerings to guests and could materially adversely affect our profitability and reputation. The type, variety, quality, source and price of beef, chicken, produce and cheese can be subject to change and also due to factors beyond our control, including weather, governmental regulation, availability and seasonality, each of which may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply. Our food distributors or suppliers may also be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higher minimum wage and benefit costs and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. Although RSI is able to contract for certain food commodities for periods up to one year, the pricing and availability of some commodities used in our operations are not locked in for periods of longer than one week or at all. We do not currently use financial instruments to hedge our risk to market fluctuations in the price of beef, produce and other food products. We may not be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs through menu price adjustments in the future, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nSecurity breaches of confidential guest information in connection with our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions may adversely affect our business.\nApproximately half of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information of their customers was compromised. We may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our guests\u2019 credit or debit card information. Any such claim or proceeding, or any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, may have a material adverse effect on us and our restaurants.\nWe depend on information technology and any material failure of that technology could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.\nWe rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, procurement and payment to significant suppliers, collection of cash, and payment of payroll and other financial obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.\nCarrols is currently a guarantor under 27 Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. (\"Fiesta\") restaurant property leases and the primary lessee on five Fiesta restaurant property leases, and any default under such property leases by Fiesta may result in substantial liabilities to us.\nFiesta, a former wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was spun-off in 2012 to the Company's stockholders. Carrols currently is a guarantor under 27 Fiesta restaurant property leases, of which all except for one are still operating as of December 29, 2019. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, which we refer to as the \"separation agreement\", dated as of April 24, 2012 and entered into in connection with the spin-off among Carrols, Fiesta and us provides that the parties will cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the release of such guarantees. Unless and until any such guarantees are released, Fiesta agrees to indemnify Carrols for any losses or liabilities or expenses that it may incur arising from or in connection with any such lease guarantees.\nCarrols is currently a primary lessee of five Fiesta restaurants which it subleases to Fiesta. The separation agreement provides that the parties will cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause Fiesta or a subsidiary of Fiesta to enter into a new master lease or individual leases with the lessor with respect to the Fiesta restaurants where Carrols is currently a lessee. The separation agreement provides that until such new master lease or such individual leases are entered into, (i) Carrols will perform its obligations under the master lease for the five Fiesta restaurants where it is a lessee and (ii) the parties will cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a non-disturbance agreement or similar agreement with the lessor which shall provide that Fiesta or one of its subsidiaries shall become the lessee under such master lease with respect to such Fiesta restaurants and perform Carrols' obligations under such master lease in the event of a breach or default by Carrols.\nSuch guarantees may never be released and a new master lease with respect to the five Fiesta properties where Carrols is the primary lessee may never be entered into by Fiesta. Any losses or liabilities that may arise in connection with such guarantees or the master lease where Carrols is not able to receive indemnification from Fiesta may result in substantial liabilities to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. The price of our common stock that will prevail in the market may be higher or lower than the price when you acquired our stock, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The fluctuations could cause a loss of all or part of an investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuation in the trading price of our common stock may include, but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of companies generally or restaurant companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in the earnings or operating results of our company or our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock or the stock of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions or trends in our industry and the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures and our ability to complete any such transaction;\n\u2022\nannouncements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022\ncapital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock, including sales of large blocks of our common stock or sales by our directors and officers; and\n\u2022\nevents that affect BKC, PLK or any of our significant suppliers discussed above.\nIn addition, if the market for restaurant company stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry or related industries even if these events do not directly affect us.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, class action securities litigation has often been brought against that company. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price, we may therefore be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources from our business, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nThe concentrated ownership of our capital stock by insiders will likely limit our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters.\nAt December 29, 2019, our executive officers, directors, BKC and Blue Holdco 1, LLC (collectively the \"BKC Stockholders\"), and Cambridge together beneficially own approximately 43.7% of our common stock, giving effect to the conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock issued to BKC Stockholders. As a result, our executive officers, directors, affiliates of RBI and Cambridge, if they act as a group, will be able to significantly influence matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. The directors will have the authority to make decisions affecting our capital structure, including the issuance of additional debt and the declaration of dividends. Each of the BKC Stockholders and Cambridge may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. Corporate action might be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us that other stockholders may view as beneficial, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and our Senior Credit Facilities limit our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. The absence of a dividend on our common stock may increase the volatility of the market price of our common stock or make it more likely that the market price of our common stock will decrease in the event of adverse economic\nconditions or adverse developments affecting our company. Additionally, our Senior Credit Facilities limit, and the debt instruments that we may enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We cannot assure you that these analysts will publish research or reports about us or that any analysts that do so will not discontinue publishing research or reports about us in the future. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price could decline rapidly. If analysts do not publish reports about us or if one or more analysts cease coverage of our stock, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nDelaware corporate law and our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nrequire that special meetings of our stockholders be called only by our board of directors or certain of our officers, thus prohibiting our stockholders from calling special meetings;\n\u2022\ndeny holders of our common stock cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, meaning that stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock will be able to elect all of our directors;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board could issue to dilute the voting and economic rights of our common stock and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprovide that approval of our board of directors or a supermajority of stockholders is necessary to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws and that approval of a supermajority of stockholders is necessary to amend, alter or change certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\ndivide our board into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered 3-year term, which generally increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of the directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors only may be removed for cause by a supermajority of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nrequire that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 29, 2019 we had $472.3 million of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of $422.9 million Term Loan B borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities, $45.8 million of revolving credit borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities, $1.2 million of lease financing obligations and $2.5 million of finance lease liabilities. As of December 29, 2019 we had $57.6 million of revolving borrowing availability under our Senior Credit Facilities (after reserving $11.6 million for letters of credit issued under the Senior Credit Facilities, which included amounts for anticipated claims from our renewals of workers' compensation and other insurance policies). On February 24, 2020, $70.8 million of revolving credit borrowings and $11.7 million of letters of credit were outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility and we had revolving borrowing availability of $32.5 million.\nAs a result of our substantial indebtedness, a significant portion of our operating cash flow will be required to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available under our Senior Credit Facilities, to enable us to repay our indebtedness, including the Term Loan B borrowings, or to fund other liquidity needs.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities and our other debt;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and related interest, including indebtedness we may incur in the future, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to acquire additional restaurants;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes.\nWe expect to use cash flow from operations, our cash balances and revolving credit borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities to meet our current and future financial obligations, including funding our operations, debt service, possible future acquisitions and capital expenditures (including restaurant remodeling and new restaurant development). Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have sufficient liquidity, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures and restaurant acquisitions, sell assets, obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including our Senior Credit Facilities, on or before maturity. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future indebtedness, including the agreements for our Senior Credit Facilities, may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.\nDespite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may still be able to incur more debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nAlthough our Senior Credit Facilities contain restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions. We could also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions, which may increase our indebtedness. Moreover, although our Senior Credit Facilities contain restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends, we are able to make such restricted payments under certain circumstances. Adding new debt to current debt levels or making restricted payments could intensify the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face.\nOur Senior Credit Facilities restrict our ability to engage in some business and financial transactions and contain certain other restrictive terms.\nOur Senior Credit Facilities restrict our ability in certain circumstances to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions on, redeem or repurchase, capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage in sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nsell all, or substantially all, of our assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets to secure debt; or\n\u2022\neffect a consolidation or merger.\nThese covenants limit our operational flexibility and could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise, growing our business or competing effectively. In addition, our Senior Credit Facilities may require us to maintain a First Lien Net Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) and satisfy other financial\ntests. At December 29, 2019, we were in compliance with such covenants. Our ability to meet these such financial ratio and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet these tests.\nA breach of any of these covenants or other provisions in our debt agreements could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in such debt becoming immediately due and payable. This, in turn, could cause our other debt to become due and payable as a result of cross-acceleration provisions contained in the agreements governing such other debt. In the event that some or all of our debt is accelerated and becomes immediately due and payable, we may not have the funds to repay, or the ability to refinance, such debt.\nWe may not have the funds necessary to satisfy all of our obligations under our Senior Credit Facilities or other indebtedness in connection with certain change of control events.\nOur Senior Credit Facilities provide that certain change of control events constitute an event of default. Such an event of default entitles the lenders thereunder to, among other things, cause all outstanding debt obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities to become due and payable and to proceed against the collateral securing such Senior Credit Facilities. Any event of default or acceleration of the Senior Credit Facilities will likely also cause a default under the terms of our other indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 91678, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "TAST"}
