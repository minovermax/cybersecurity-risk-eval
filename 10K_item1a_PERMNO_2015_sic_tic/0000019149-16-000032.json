{"cik": "19149", "company": "CHAMPION INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-01-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s business and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDependence on Marshall T. Reynolds; Control of the Company.\nThe Company's operations and prospects are dependent in large part on the continued efforts of Marshall T. Reynolds. The loss of Mr. Reynolds could have an adverse effect on the Company. In addition, by virtue of Mr. Reynolds' ownership of Company common stock, Mr. Reynolds will continue to significantly influence our operations. As of October 31, 2015, Marshall T. Reynolds and his affiliated entities, including The Harrah and Reynolds Corporation (\"Harrah and Reynolds\"), held 6,067,742 shares (53.7%) of the common stock of the Company prior to the effect of the issuance of stock warrants. Mr. Reynolds and Harrah and Reynolds have pledged a large portion of these shares as collateral to secure loans made to Mr. Reynolds or Harrah and Reynolds in the ordinary course of business by several commercial banks. Any disposition of such pledged shares upon a default by Mr. Reynolds or Harrah and Reynolds under such loans could result in a change in control of the Company. Mr. Reynolds has also received warrants from the Previous Secured Lenders to purchase 30% of the then issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, on a fully diluted, post-exercise basis. Based on the 11,299,528 shares of company common stock currently issued and outstanding, exercise in full of the warrants would result in the issuance of 4,842,654 shares.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and reduce the funds available to us for other purposes, including dividend (if any in the future) payments and our credit position may result in dilution to our shareholders\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. The Company\u2019s October 2014 Credit Agreement has a maturity of April 1, 2017, and is collateralized by substantially all of our assets.\nThe Company must maintain trade credit availability to operate. The Company has generally been able to maintain substantial trade credit availability to date.\nVolatility in U.S. credit markets could affect the Company's ability to obtain financing to fund acquisitions, investments, or other significant operating or capital expenditures.\nTightening of credit availability could restrict the Company's ability to finance significant transactions and also limit its ability to refinance its existing capital structure or to fund its current operation pursuant to the terms of the Company's applicable credit agreements. The Company's credit facilities under the October 2013 Credit Agreement mature on April 1, 2017.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive market that could negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn the printing segment, there has been an ongoing consolidation resulting in fewer competitors. This in part has resulted in numerous competitors that are larger with greater geographic diversity and broader product offerings. In addition, the office products and office furniture industries are extremely competitive and fragmented. The Company competes with numerous large and small companies that operate in each industry, some of which have greater financial resources than the Company. The Company competes on the basis of its reputation for quality, production capability, prompt delivery, price and strength of its continuing customer relationships.\nOur supply-chain management services are embedded into our printing and office products and office furniture segments. The competitive factors faced by the Company include customer service, price, distribution geography, information technology and the customer's fulfillment and distribution needs.\nThe Company may be adversely impacted by the rising costs of critical raw materials such as paper, ink, energy and other raw materials.\nOur primary raw material is paper; therefore the purchase of paper and other raw materials such as ink, energy and items we distribute such as office products and office furniture and goods and services represent a large portion of our costs. Any increases in the costs of these items will also increase our costs. Depending on the nature of such increases we may not be able to pass these costs on to customers through higher prices. Increases in the costs of these items may also adversely impact our customers\u2019 demand for printing and related services as well as for office products and office furniture.\nThe Company has substantial investment in the credit worthiness and financial condition of our customers.\nThe largest current asset on the Company's balance sheet on a net basis is our accounts receivable balances from our customers. We grant credit to substantially all of our customers. A decline in financial condition across a significant component of our customer base could hinder our ability to collect amounts owed by customers. In addition, such a decline could result in lower demand for our services. The potential causes of such a decline include national or local economic downturns, the fact that many of our customers are in highly-competitive industries or markets and the impact of regulatory actions may hinder the financial stability of our customers.\nWe may have difficulty adjusting our operating models to meet changing or current market conditions.\nBecause the markets in which we compete are highly-competitive, we must continue to improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve our profitability. Although we have been able to improve efficiency and reduce costs in the past, there is no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future. In addition, the need to reduce ongoing operating costs may result in significant up-front costs to reduce workforce, close or consolidate facilities, or upgrade equipment and technology.\nWe may be unable to grow through acquisitions or to successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nThe Company has historically grown through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. It is critical that the Company achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. The integration of companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges, and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. In particular, the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The integration of acquired businesses may also require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily shift senior management\u2019s attention from the other day-to-day operations of the Company. Our strategy is, in part, predicated on our ability to realize cost savings and to increase revenues through the acquisition of businesses that strategically enhance our capabilities and services. The Company has made no significant acquisitions since 2007, and has sold, combined, or discontinued many operating divisions in the last several years.\nWe may have difficulty hiring and retaining appropriate employees including senior management.\nOur success depends, in part, on our general ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled employees. The loss of a significant number of our employees or the inability to attract, hire, develop, train and retain additional skilled personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. We currently operate in several locations with geographic diversity. Individual locations may encounter strong competition from other employers for skilled labor.\nWe may be negatively impacted by strikes or other work stoppages by our employees.\nWe employ no employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If our employees were to engage in a concerted strike or other work stoppage, or if our employees were to become unionized, we could experience a disruption of operations, higher labor costs or both.\nWe may have increased employee benefit costs for health care and other benefits.\nWe provide health care and certain other benefits to our employees. In recent years, costs for health care have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. If this trend in health care costs continues, our cost to provide such benefits could increase, adversely impacting our business and results of operations.\nWe may be negatively impacted by declines in general economic conditions or acts of war and terrorism.\nDemand for printing services is highly correlated with general economic conditions. A decline in U.S. economic conditions may, therefore, adversely impact our business and results of operations. Because such outcomes are difficult to predict, the industry may experience excess capacity resulting in declines in prices for our services. The overall business climate may also be impacted by foreign wars or domestic or foreign acts of terrorism. Such acts may have sudden and unpredictable adverse impacts on demand for our services.\nWe may face adverse pricing pressures as a result of operating in a highly-competitive market.\nThe markets for our services are highly fragmented and we have a large number of competitors, resulting in a highly-competitive market and increasing the risk of adverse pricing pressures in various circumstances outside of our control, including economic downturns.\nWe are dependent on the markets utilizing printed materials in lieu of alternative media.\nElectronic delivery of documents and data offers alternatives to traditional printed documents. The extent to which electronic formats will gain acceptance is uncertain and difficult to predict but as digital alternatives replace or reduce the need for traditional printed materials, the sales of the Company\u2019s printed products will be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by regulatory and tax requirements.\nWe are subject to numerous rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, environmental and health and welfare benefit regulations as well as those associated with being a public company in addition to numerous federal, state, and local tax rules and regulations. These rules and regulations and associated interpretations may be changed by local, state or federal governments or agencies. Changes in these regulations may result in a significant increase in our compliance costs. Compliance with changes in rules and regulations could require increases to our workforce, increased cost for services, compensation and benefits, or investments in new or upgraded equipment. In addition, audits and examinations of prior years may result in liabilities and additional financial burdens.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology. If our systems fail or are unreliable, our operations may be adversely impacted.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology infrastructure and our management information systems. In addition, production technology in the printing industry has continued to evolve specifically related to the pre-press component of production. We rely on our management information systems to effectively manage accounting and financial functions, job entry, tracking and cost accumulation and certain purchasing functions as well as fulfillment and inventory management including e-commerce activities. Our information technology infrastructure includes both third party solutions and applications designed and maintained internally. Since our Company operates on multiple platforms, the failure of our information technology infrastructure and/or our management information systems to perform could severely disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operation. In addition, our information technology infrastructure and/or our management information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural or man-made disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or hackers, power loss, or other computer systems, Internet telecommunications or data network failures. Any such interruption could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nChanges in economic conditions in the markets we serve may produce volatility in demand for our products and services.\nOur operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy. Softness in the U.S. economy, or the local economies in the markets in which we serve, could significantly impact our revenue.\nWe may not be able to pay or maintain dividends and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.\nOur ability to pay dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our cash flows, our cash requirements, our financial condition, the degree to which we are/or become leveraged, contractual restrictions binding on us, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash from continuing operations in the future, or have sufficient surplus or net profits to pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy is based upon our directors\u2019 current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate and that assessment could change based on competitive or technological developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures) or new growth opportunities. Our board of directors may, in its discretion, amend or repeal our dividend policy to decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends. The reduction or elimination of dividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may incur Additional Non-Cash Impairment Charges.\nAt October 31, 2015 the Company had $2.3 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. In 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2009, we recorded substantial impairment charges to reduce the value of certain of these assets. Should general economic, market or business conditions decline further, and continue to have a negative impact on our stock price or projected future cash flows, we may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future. See Item 7, \u201cCritical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates\u201d, included herein, for additional information on the risks associated with such assets.\nCyber security risks could harm our ability to operate effectively.\nWe use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Such uses give rise to cyber security risks. We believe we have appropriate preventive systems and processes in place to protect against the risk of cyber-incidents. Prolonged system outages or a cyber-incident that would be undetected for an extended period could reduce our revenue, increase our operating costs, or disrupt our operations.", "PERMNO": 78816, "SIC": 2750, "TIC": "CHMP"}
