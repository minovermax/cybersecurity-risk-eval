The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company, and the risks described herein are not listed in order of the potential occurrence or severity. There is no assurance that we have identified, assessed and appropriately addressed all risks affecting our business operations. Additional risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our business and our results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, and the market price for our shares could decline. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below are cautionary statements, identifying important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. There can also be no assurance that the actual future results, performance, benefits or achievements that we expect from our strategies, systems, initiatives or products will occur.\nBusiness Strategy\nIf we cannot successfully execute our business strategy, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. There are numerous risks associated with this strategy including, but not limited to, the following:\nRisk\nDescription\n1. Failure to identify and respond to fashion trends that appeal to our customer and implement and manage our business strategy may adversely impact sales and profitability\nOur future success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify and respond to fashion trends in a timely manner and develop innovative, high-quality merchandise in styles that appeal to our consumers and in ways that favorably distinguish us from our competitors. The specialty retail apparel business fluctuates according to changes in the economy and customer preferences, influenced by fashion and season. These fluctuations affect the inventory sourced by our brands as merchandise typically must be ordered well in advance of the selling season. There can be no assurance that we will appropriately anticipate consumer demands and accurately plan brand-right inventory in the future.\nOur long-term omnichannel business strategy is dependent upon a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, customer shopping habits (such as online versus in-store) and discretionary income, identifying and developing new brand extensions, markets and channels of distribution, effectively using and evolving our marketing resources and programs to communicate with existing and potential customers, maintaining favorable brand recognition, effectively managing our store base, including management of store productivity and negotiating acceptable lease terms, effectively managing our franchise, wholesale and licensing relationships to optimize sales and margin and to protect our brands, having the appropriate corporate resources to support our business strategies, sourcing appropriate levels of inventory in line with sales expectations and then managing its disposition, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees, generating sufficient operating cash flows to fund our business strategies, maintaining brand-specific websites that offer the system functionality, service and security customers expect, and correctly identifying, implementing and maintaining appropriate technology to support our business strategies.\n2. Competition\nThe women's specialty retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national and international department stores, specialty and discount stores, catalogs and internet businesses offering similar categories of merchandise. Many of our competitors have advantages over us, including substantially greater financial, marketing, distribution and other resources. Increased levels of promotional activity by our competitors, some of whom may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can, both online and in stores, may negatively impact our sales and profitability. There is no assurance that we can compete successfully with these companies in the future. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for store and online traffic, for favorable store locations and lease terms and for qualified associates. The growth of fast fashion, value fashion retailers and expansion of off-price retailers has shifted shopper expectations to more affordable pricing of well-known brands and has contributed to continued promotional pressure as well as a shift in customers\u2019 expectations with regard to the timing and costs of product deliveries and returns. If we do not identify and respond to these emerging trends in consumer spending as well as the growing preference of many customers for online e-commerce options, we may harm our ability to retain our existing customers or attract new customers. Increased competition in any of these areas may result in higher costs or otherwise reduce our sales or operating margins.\n3. Risks of expanding internationally\nOur current strategy includes potential expansion of our operations and presence internationally. As part of that strategy, we may face unanticipated and significant costs and challenges in setting up foreign offices, hiring experienced management or franchising partners, negotiating profitable licensing or franchising agreements, obtaining prime locations for stores, introducing and marketing our brands, and others.\nWe may be unable to successfully grow our international business, or we may face operational issues or resource constraints that delay our intended pace of international growth, such as an inability to identify suitable franchising partners, to identify profitable markets for our brands and sites for store locations, to anticipate and address the different operational or cultural challenges presented in a new country, to find vendors that can meet our international merchandise needs, to provide adequate resource and system support through our shared service model, to achieve acceptable operating margins, compete with local competitors or adapt to different consumer demand and behavior. Any challenges that we encounter may divert financial, operational and managerial resources from our existing operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain U.S. laws that may impact our international operations or expansion, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. Violations of these laws could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nNumerous economic conditions, all of which are outside of our control, could negatively affect the level of our customers' spending or our costs of operations. If these economic conditions persist for a sustained period, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. These economic conditions include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisk\nDescription\n4. Declines in consumer spending\nConsumer spending in our sector may decline as a result of: threatened or actual government shut downs, higher unemployment levels, low levels of consumer credit, declines in consumer confidence, inflation, changes in interest rates, recessionary pressures, increasing gas and other energy costs, increased taxes, changes in housing prices, higher durable goods or other consumer spending, volatility in the financial markets, uncertainty regarding the political environment and concerns regarding public health crises.\n5. Fluctuating costs\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics and other raw materials used to manufacture our products, as well as the price for labor and transportation, may contribute to ongoing pricing pressures throughout our supply chain. The price and availability of such inputs to the manufacturing process may fluctuate significantly, depending on several factors, including commodity costs (such as higher cotton prices), energy costs (such as fuel), shipping costs, inflationary pressures from emerging markets, increased labor costs, weather conditions and currency fluctuations.\n6. Impairment charges\nSignificant negative industry or general economic trends, changes in customer demand for our product, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our operating results or use of long-lived assets (such as boutique relocations or discontinuing use of certain boutique fixtures) may result in impairments to goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.\n7. Fluctuating comparable sales and operating results\nOur comparable sales and overall operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. In addition to other factors discussed in this Item 1A., a variety of factors affect comparable sales and operating results, including changes in fashion trends, changes in our merchandise mix, customer acceptance of merchandise offerings, the timing of marketing activities, calendar shifts of holiday periods, the periodic impact of a fifty-three-week fiscal year, weather conditions and general economic conditions. In addition, our ability to address the current challenges of sustained declining store traffic combined with a highly promotional retail environment and our execution of our retail fleet optimization plan and related store closings may impact our comparable sales, operating results and ability to maintain or gain market share. Past comparable sales or operating results are not an indicator of future results.\nOmnichannel Operations\nOur omnichannel operations (including our websites and catalogs) are a critical part of our customers\u2019 overall experience with our brands and will be a significant contributor to our future business growth and profitability. Our inability or failure to successfully manage and maintain those operations could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Specific risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisk\nDescription\n8. Reliance on technology\nOur brands\u2019 websites and select systems, including our integrated inventory management system, are heavily dependent on technology, which creates numerous risks including unanticipated operating problems, system failures, rapid technological change, failure of technology to operate the websites and systems as anticipated, reliance on third-party computer hardware and software providers, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, liability for online content, systems and data breaches, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing attacks, computer hackers and other similar disruptions. Our failure to successfully assess and respond to these risks could negatively impact sales, increase costs, inhibit our ability to acquire new customers and damage the reputation of our brands.\n9. Reliance on the U.S. Postal Service and other shipping vendors\nWe utilize shipping vendors to support our operations. Any significant and unanticipated increase in shipping costs, reduction in service, or slow-down in delivery could impair our ability to deliver merchandise in a timely or economically efficient manner.\nPostal rate increases or a reduction or delay in service could affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalog and promotional mailings. We use the Postal Service to mail millions of catalogs each year to educate our customers about our products, acquire new customers, drive customers to our boutiques and websites and promote catalog sales. We rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting.\n10. Inability to successfully launch other channels of sales, marketing and distribution\nOur strategic plans include additional channels for the marketing and sale of our product and brands, including through franchise, wholesale, licensing and alternative distribution models. Each of these methods presents new operational, reputational and financial challenges for us. Our inability to find the right markets, partners or business models, our inability to negotiate agreements that protect our profit and brand quality and reputation, or our inability to accurately anticipate the resources, systems and operational needs that go along with these new ventures could result in lower than expected returns and adversely impact other areas of our business.\nInformation Technology Systems\nIn addition to the dependence of our retail websites and other systems on technology as discussed above, we also rely on various information technology systems to manage our overall operations, and failure of those systems to operate as expected or a significant interruption in service could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisk\nDescription\n11. Disruptions while maintaining current systems or difficulties in integrating new systems\nWe and third-party providers on whom we rely regularly maintain, upgrade, enhance or replace our websites and information technology systems to support our business strategies and provide business continuity. Replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality have inherent risks including disruptions, delays, gaps in functionality, user acceptance, adequate user training or other difficulties that may impair the effectiveness of our information technology systems.\n12. Cybersecurity/ Data Privacy\nOur business involves the storage and/or transmission of customers\u2019 personal information, shipping preferences and credit card information, as well as confidential information regarding our business, employees and third parties. In addition, as part of our acceptance of customers\u2019 debit and credit cards as forms of payment, we are required to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI\u201d).\nBecause we have access to, collect or maintain information about our customers, the protection of that data is critical to our business. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy continues to evolve, and new laws increasingly are giving customers the right to control how their personal data is used. One such law is the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). Our failure to comply with the obligations of GDPR could in the future result in significant penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the State of California adopted the California Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective in 2020 and regulates the collection and use of consumers' data. Complying with GDPR, CCPA and similar U.S. federal and state laws, including a potential federal privacy law and state privacy laws, could also cause us to incur substantial costs, forego a substantial amount of revenue or be subject to business risk associated with system changes and new business processes.\nWe are also subject to cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity refers to the combination of technologies, processes and procedures established to protect information technology systems and data from unauthorized access, attack, exfiltration, loss or damage. We may not be able to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increased costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants.\nWhile we have implemented measures reasonably designed to prevent security breaches, cyber incidents and privacy violations, and while we have taken steps to comply with PCI, GDPR, CCPA and other laws, those measures may not be effective and we may experience security breaches, cyber incidents and privacy violations in the future.\nA cyber breach or incident or privacy violation through any means, including indirectly through third-party service providers and vendors, could result in the loss or misuse of data and could result in significant fines, penalties, damages, loss of business, legal expenses, remediation costs, reputational damage or loss of our ability to accept debit and credit cards as forms for payment. In addition, changes in laws or regulations, the PCI standards or technology, could result in increased expenses due to system or administrative costs.\nSourcing and Distribution Strategies\nOur sourcing and distribution strategies are subject to numerous risks that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisk\nDescription\n13. Reliance on foreign sources of production\nThe majority of the merchandise we sell is produced outside the United States. As a result, our business remains subject to the various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as: geo-political instability, non-compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, potential changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement and other international trade agreements, imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas, imposition of new or increased duties, taxes, or other charges on imports, foreign exchange rate challenges and pressures presented by implementation of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and other international central banks, challenges from local business practices or political issues, manufacturing and transportation disruptions, our shift to a predominantly FOB (free on board) shipping structure rather than predominantly DDP (delivered duty paid), natural disasters, public health crises, delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations or government funding; seizure or detention of goods by U.S. Customs authorities, or a reduction in the availability of shipping sources caused by industry consolidation or other reasons. We source a substantial portion of our merchandise from Asia, including China. A reduction in the number of foreign suppliers, through bankruptcy or otherwise, or any change in exchange rates, labor laws or policies affecting the costs of goods in Asia could negatively impact our merchandise costs and the timely availability of the desired amount of merchandise. Furthermore, delays in production or shipping product, whether due to work slow-downs, work stoppages, strikes, port congestion, labor disputes, product regulations and customs inspections, public health crises or other factors, could also have a negative impact.\nFor example, the recent outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan, China has led to work and travel restrictions in and out of China as well as temporary closures or production and logistics constraints due to workforce availability of certain factories in China. These travel restrictions, factory closures, production and logistics constraints may result in delayed shipments and increased shipping costs for some of our fiscal 2020 merchandise.\nDuring fiscal 2019, China sourced product accounted for approximately 46% of our merchandise cost. If the coronavirus outbreak continues and results in a prolonged period of travel, commercial and other similar restrictions, or a delay in production or distribution operations at any or all of our suppliers\u2019 facilities in China, we could experience significant supply chain disruptions. We are monitoring the situation on a daily basis, but it is currently unknown whether the outbreak will meaningfully disrupt our merchandise shipments or meaningfully impact manufacturing at any of our suppliers\u2019 plants in China or elsewhere. If we experience significant supply chain disruptions in China or other countries, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly on favorable terms, if at all, which could result in increased costs, loss of sales and a loss of customers, and adversely impact our margins and results of operation.\nFurther, there have been ongoing discussions, commentary and governmental actions regarding potentially significant changes to the United States trade policies, treaties, tariffs and taxes, including trade policies and tariffs regarding China. During fiscal 2018, the U.S. began to impose duties on certain Chinese-made imported products. In May 2019, the current administration announced an increase to the tariffs currently being imposed on certain imports from 10% to 25%, effective May 10, 2019, which was further increased to 30% beginning on October 1, 2019. In August 2019, the administration announced plans to implement a tariff of 15% on approximately $300 billion of products imported into the U.S. from China (referred to as List 4). On February 14, 2020, the tariffs leveraged on List 4 were reduced in half to 7.5%.\nThese tariffs, as well as any additional tariffs, may result in lower gross margins on affected products. Our ability to mitigate the negative effect of tariffs on our cost of goods is limited and our efforts to do so may not be successful. We may be able to shift a greater portion of our sourcing away from China to avoid tariffs, but executing such a shift could take time and could result in an increase in non-tariff related manufacturing costs and/or negatively affect the quality of our products. Our ability to pass increases in our cost of goods through to our customers via increased prices is also limited. Any such increase in pricing could reduce the competitiveness of our products. We can offer no assurances that price increases would be accepted by our customers, or that price increases would be sufficient to offset the effect of future cost increases.\nWhile the USTR and the Ministry of Commerce of China signed a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal on January 15, 2020, which, among other things, officially agreed to the rollback of tariffs and expansion of trade purchases, there is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China and other countries with respect to the trade policies, treaties, taxes, government regulations and tariffs that would be applicable. It is unclear what changes might be considered or implemented and what response to any such changes may be by the governments of other countries. Significant tariffs or other restrictions placed on Chinese imports and any related counter-measures that are taken by China could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Even in the absence of further tariffs, the related uncertainty and the market's fear of an escalating trade war might create forecasting difficulties for us and cause our customers and business partners to place fewer orders for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and affect our strategy around the world.\nGiven the relatively fluid regulatory environment in China and the United States and relative uncertainty with respect to tariffs, international trade agreements and policies, a trade war, further governmental action related to tariffs or international trade policies, or additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future could directly and adversely impact our financial results and results of operations.\n14. Our suppliers\u2019 inability to provide quality goods in a timely manner\nWe are subject to risk because we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend on independent third parties to manufacture our merchandise. A key supplier may become unable to address our manufacturing needs for a variety of reasons. If we were unexpectedly required to change suppliers or if a key supplier were unable to supply quality merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms, we could experience a significant impact to the supply or cost of merchandise.\n15. Reliance upon one supplier\nApproximately 19% of total purchases in fiscal 2019 and 23% of total purchases in fiscal 2018 were made from one supplier, and we cannot guarantee that this relationship will be maintained in the future or that the supplier will continue to be available to supply merchandise. However, we have no material long-term or exclusive contract with any apparel or accessory manufacturer or supplier. Our business depends on our network of suppliers and our continued good relations with them.\n16. Our suppliers\u2019 failure to implement acceptable labor practices\nAlthough we have adopted our Terms of Commitment to Ethical Sourcing and use the services of third-party audit firms to monitor compliance with these terms, some of our independent suppliers may not be in complete compliance with our guidelines at all times. The violation of labor or other laws by any of our key independent suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier\u2019s labor practices from those generally accepted by us as ethical could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished merchandise or damage our reputation.\n17. Reliance on one location to distribute goods for our brands\nWith minor exceptions, the distribution functions for all of our brands are handled from our DC in Winder, Georgia and a significant interruption in the operation of that facility due to changes to existing systems, use of other facilities, natural disasters, severe weather, accidents, system failures, capacity constraints or other unforeseen causes could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and/or fulfill online or catalog orders.\nOther Risks Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous other risks that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisk\nDescription\n18. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations\nOur policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to help us comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws, accounting and reporting requirements, regulations and tax requirements, including those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), as well as applicable employment and data security laws and various applicable laws in foreign jurisdictions. We could be subject to legal or regulatory action in the event of our failure to comply, which could be expensive to defend and resolve and be disruptive to our business. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affects us may increase the complexity of the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance.\n19. Adverse outcomes of litigation matters\nWe are involved in litigation and other claims against our business. These matters arise primarily in the ordinary course of business but could raise complex factual and legal issues, presenting multiple risks and uncertainties and requiring significant management time. Our assessment could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to pending or potential legal actions against us, not presently known to us, or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are inconsistent with our evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation. In addition, we may be subject to litigation which has not yet been filed.\n20. Our inability to retain or recruit key personnel\nOur success and ability to properly manage our business depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, including executive and senior management and talented merchants. Competition for talented employees within our industry is intense. Failure to recruit and retain such personnel and implement appropriate succession planning, including the transition of new executives, particularly at the senior executive level, could jeopardize our future success.\n21. Our inability to achieve the results of our strategic initiatives\nWe have launched significant initiatives designed to reposition our brands, drive sales, acquire new customers, establish new channels of distribution, achieve organization efficiency and further align the organizational structure for long-term growth. These initiatives require substantial internal change and effort, including reductions and changes in vendors and personnel, reductions in store locations and significant adjustments in how we design and source product and how we ultimately present and sell it to our customers. These initiatives may not deliver all of the results we expect. Moreover, the process of implementing them places significant stress on the Company and could result in unexpected short-term interruptions or negative impacts to our business, such as disruptions to our current business processes as we migrate to the new processes, or failure to successfully migrate to those new processes, which could negatively impact product flow, product quality or inventory levels, or result in impairment of long-lived assets.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that we can complete the implementation of all of these initiatives in the manner or in the time-frame planned, or that, once implemented, they will result in the expected increases in the efficiency or productivity of our business.\n22. The terms of our Credit Agreement may restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business, manage our operations, and it may be difficult to replace our credit facility\nOur credit agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) contains customary representations, warranties, and affirmative covenants, as well as customary negative covenants, that, among other things restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries to: (i) incur liens, (ii) make investments, (iii) issue or incur additional indebtedness, (iv) undergo significant corporate changes, including mergers and acquisitions, (v) make dispositions, (vi) make restricted payments, (vii) prepay other indebtedness and (viii) enter into certain other restrictive agreements. The Company may pay cash dividends and repurchase shares under its share buyback program, subject to certain thresholds of available borrowings based upon the lesser of the aggregate amount of commitments under the Agreement and the borrowing base (the \u201cLoan Cap\u201d), determined after giving effect to any such transaction or payment, on a pro forma basis. The ability of the Company to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the Company's repayment obligations. Also, the inability to obtain credit on commercially reasonable terms in the future when this facility expires could adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, market conditions could potentially impact the size and terms of a replacement facility or facilities.\nOur Credit Agreement bears interest based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). Any changes in regulatory standards or industry practices, such as the transition away from LIBOR as a benchmark reference for short-term interests, may result in the usage of a higher reference rate for our variable rate debt.\n23. War, terrorism, public health crises or other catastrophes\nIn the event of war, acts of terrorism or the threat of terrorist attacks, public health crises, weather catastrophes or other events outside of our control, consumer spending could significantly decrease for a sustained period. In addition, local authorities or shopping center management could close stores in response to any immediate security concern, public health concern or weather catastrophe such as hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes. Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control could affect our business negatively, harming our operating results.\nSimilarly, war, acts of terrorism, threats of terrorist attacks, public health crises or a weather catastrophe could severely and adversely affect our National Store Support Center (\u201cNSSC\u201d) campus, our DC, or our entire supply chain. If any of our facilities, including our DC, our company-operated or franchised stores or the facilities of our suppliers or third-party service providers is affected by a natural disaster, public health crisis (such as a pandemic and epidemic), terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nFor example, as noted above in \u201cReliance on foreign sources of production,\u201d the recent outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has already modestly affected our supply chain. In recent days, this outbreak has resulted in reduced customer traffic and the temporary reduction of operating hours for our stores as well as temporary store closures where government mandated. These recent developments are expected to result in lower sales and gross margin than provided in our previous outlook.\n24. Our inability to protect our brands\u2019 reputation\nOur ability to protect our brands\u2019 reputations is an integral part of our general success strategy and is critical to the overall value of the brands. If we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity in our business conduct or fail to address other risk factors, including threats to data and privacy and cybersecurity, such failures could jeopardize our brands' reputations. Consumers value readily available information from social media and other sources concerning retailers and their goods and services and many times act on such information without further investigation in regards to its accuracy. Any negative publicity, whether true or not, may affect our reputation and brand and, consequently, reduce demand for our merchandise, decrease customer and investor loyalty and affect our vendor relationships.\n25. Our inability to protect our intellectual property\nAlthough we devote resources to protect our intellectual property, others may still attempt to imitate our products or infringe upon our intellectual property rights. Other parties may also claim that some of our products infringe on their trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices in many foreign countries can be substantially different from those in the U.S. There are also inherent challenges with enforcing intellectual property rights on third party e-commerce websites, especially those based in foreign jurisdictions. We cannot guarantee that such rights are not infringed.\n26. Stock price volatility\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Future announcements or management discussions concerning us or our competitors, sales and profitability results, quarterly variations in operating results or comparable sales, updates on our strategic initiatives, changes in earnings estimates by analysts or the failure of investors or analysts to understand our business strategies or fundamental changes in our business or sector, among other factors, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, stock markets have experienced periods of significant price or volume volatility in recent years. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies.\n27. Our business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders or others\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal and business challenges in the operation of our Company due to proxy contests, consent solicitations, shareholder proposals, media campaigns and other such actions instituted by activist shareholders or others. In the event of shareholder activism, particularly with respect to matters which our Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to such actions is costly and time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, may not align with our business strategies and may divert the attention of our Board of Directors and management from the pursuit of current business strategies. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction or changes to the composition of our Board of Directors as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of instability in the organization and its future and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.\n28. Disadvantageous lease obligations and commercial retail consolidation\nWe have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to fulfill our obligations under the applicable lease including paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Additionally, continued consolidation in the commercial retail real estate market could affect our ability to successfully negotiate favorable rental terms for our stores in the future and could concentrate our leases with fewer landlords who may then be in a position to dictate unfavorable terms to us due to their significant negotiating leverage. If we are unable to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close, this could affect our ability to profitably operate our stores.\n29. Changes to accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our financial results, financial position and cash flows\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to revenue recognition, leases, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, inventory, income taxes and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change or increase volatility of our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. See Note 1, to our consolidated financial statements under the heading \u201cRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies,\u201d included in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of accounting policies considered to be important to our operational results and financial condition. These and other future changes to accounting rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flow presentation.\n30. Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility in our results of operations\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in local, national and international jurisdictions. Our tax returns and other tax matters are also subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. These examinations may challenge certain of our tax positions, such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of taxable income to various jurisdictions. The results of any tax audits could adversely affect our financial results. Furthermore, our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdiction and deductibility of excess share-based compensation.\n31. The Company cannot provide any assurance that in the future the Company will continue to pay dividends or continue to repurchase stock pursuant to its share repurchase\nprogram\nAll decisions regarding authorization to pay a dividend on the Company\u2019s common stock or approve a share repurchase program will be made by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) from time to time based on the Board\u2019s evaluation of the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board will complete each evaluation based on a review of the Company\u2019s stock price, future earnings, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant. There is no assurance that the Board will continue to declare dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock in the future. The Company\u2019s current share repurchase program authorizes $300 million in share repurchases of the Company\u2019s common stock, of which $55.2 million remained authorized for repurchase under the program as of February 1, 2020. However, the Company is not obligated to make any purchases under the share repurchase program and the program may be discontinued at any time.", "PERMNO": 78963, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "CHS"}
