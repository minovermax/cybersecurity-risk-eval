{"cik": "1018164", "company": "WILLIS LEASE FINANCE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe are affected by the risks faced by commercial aircraft operators and maintenance, repair and overhaul companies (\u201cMROs\u201d) because they are our customers.\nCommercial aircraft operators are engaged in economically sensitive, highly cyclical and competitive businesses. We are a supplier to commercial aircraft operators and MROs. As a result, we are indirectly affected by all the risks facing commercial aircraft operators and MROs, with such risks being largely beyond our control. Our results of operations depend, in part, on the financial strength of our customers and our customers\u2019 ability to compete effectively in the marketplace and manage their risks. These risks include, among others:\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions in the countries in which our customers operate, including changes in gross domestic product;\n\u00b7\ndemand for air travel and air cargo shipments;\n\u00b7\nincreased competition;\n\u00b7\nchanges in interest rates and the availability and terms of credit available to commercial aircraft operators;\n\u00b7\nconcerns about security, terrorism, war, public health and political instability;\n\u00b7\ninclement weather and natural disasters, including but not limited to volcanic eruptions;\n\u00b7\nenvironmental compliance and other regulatory costs;\n\u00b7\nlabor contracts, labor costs and strikes or stoppages at commercial aircraft operators;\n\u00b7\naircraft fuel prices and availability;\n\u00b7\ntechnological developments;\n\u00b7\nmaintenance costs;\n\u00b7\nairport access and air traffic control infrastructure constraints;\n\u00b7\ninsurance and other operating costs;\n\u00b7\nindustry capacity, utilization and general market conditions; and\n\u00b7\nmarket prices for aviation equipment.\nTo the extent that our customers are negatively affected by these risk factors, we may experience:\n\u00b7\na decrease in demand for some engine types in our portfolio;\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ngreater credit risks from our customers, and a higher incidence of lessee defaults and corresponding repossessions;\n\u00b7\nan inability to quickly lease engines and aircraft on commercially acceptable terms when these become available through our purchase commitments and regular lease terminations; and\n\u00b7\nshorter lease terms, which may increase our expenses and reduce our utilization rates.\nOur engine values and lease rates, which are dependent on the status of the types of aircraft on which engines are installed, and other factors, could decline.\nThe value of a particular model of engine depends heavily on the types of aircraft on which it may be installed and the supply of available engines. We believe values of engines tend to be relatively stable so long as there is sufficient demand for the host aircraft. However, we believe the value of an engine begins to decline rapidly once the host aircraft begins to be retired from service and/or used for spare parts in significant numbers. Certain types of engines may be used in significant numbers by commercial aircraft operators that are currently experiencing financial difficulties. If such operators were to go into liquidation or similar proceedings, the resulting over-supply of engines from these operators could have an adverse effect on the demand for the affected engine types and the values of such engines.\nUpon termination of a lease, we may be unable to enter into new leases or sell the engine or its parts on acceptable terms.\nWe directly or indirectly own the engines that we lease to customers and bear the risk of not recovering our entire investment through leasing and selling the engines. Upon termination of a lease, we seek to enter a new lease or to sell or part-out the engine. We also selectively sell engines on an opportunistic basis. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to find, in a timely manner, a lessee or a buyer for our engines coming off-lease or for their associated parts. If we do find a lessee, we may not be able to obtain satisfactory lease rates and terms (including maintenance and redelivery conditions) or rates and terms comparable to our current leases, and we can give no assurance that the creditworthiness of any future lessee will be equal to or better than that of the existing lessees of our engines. Because the terms of engine leases may be less than 12 months, we may frequently need to remarket engines. We face the risk that we may not be able to keep our engines on lease consistently.\nWe are subject to the risks and costs of aircraft maintenance and obsolescence on the aircraft that we own.\nWe currently own and lease nine Boeing 737 aircraft, three ATR72-202 turboprops, and four A319-112 aircraft. We may buy other aircraft or interests in aircraft in the future primarily to seek opportunities to realize value from the engines or related parts on those aircraft. Among other risks described in this Annual Report, the following risks apply when we lease or sell aircraft:\n\u00b7\nwe will be subject to the greater maintenance risks and risks of declines in value that apply to aircraft as opposed to engines, as well as the potentially greater risks of leasing or selling aircraft;\n\u00b7\nintense competition among manufacturers, lessors, part-out companies and sellers may, among other things, adversely affect the demand for, lease rates and residual values of our aircraft;\n\u00b7\nour aircraft lessees are aircraft operators engaged in economically sensitive, highly cyclical and competitive businesses and our results of operations from aircraft leasing depend, in part, on their financial strength (for more details, see the risk factor above entitled \u201cWe are affected by the risks faced by commercial aircraft operators and MROs because they are our customers\u201d);\n\u00b7\nour aircraft lessees may encounter significant financial difficulties, which could result in our agreeing to amend our leases with the customer to, among other things, defer or forgive rent payments or extend lease terms as an alternative to repossession;\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nour aircraft lessees may file for bankruptcy which could result in us incurring greater losses with respect to aircraft than with respect to engines; and\n\u00b7\naircraft technology is constantly improving and, as a result, aircraft of a particular model and type tend to become obsolete and less in demand over time, when newer, more advanced and efficient aircraft become available.\nWe carry the risk of maintenance for our leased assets. Our maintenance reserves may be inadequate or lessees may default on their obligations to perform maintenance, which could increase our expenses.\nUnder most of our engine and aircraft leases, the lessee makes monthly maintenance reserve payments to us based on the asset\u2019s usage and management\u2019s estimate of maintenance costs. A certain level of maintenance reserve payments on the WEST II and WEST III engines are held in related engine reserve restricted cash accounts. Generally, the lessee under long term leases is responsible for all scheduled maintenance costs, even if they exceed the amounts of maintenance reserves paid. Forty-six of our leases comprising approximately 26.0% of the net book value of our on-lease assets at December 31, 2017 do not provide for any monthly maintenance reserve payments to be made by lessees, and we can give no assurance that future leases of our engines will require maintenance reserves. In some cases, including engine and aircraft repossessions, we may decide to pay for refurbishments or repairs if the accumulated use fees are inadequate.\nWe can give no assurance that our operating cash flows and available liquidity reserves, including the amounts held in the engine reserve restricted cash accounts, will be sufficient to fund necessary engine maintenance. Actual maintenance reserve payments by lessees and other cash that we receive may be significantly less than projected as a result of numerous factors, including defaults by lessees. Furthermore, we can provide no assurance that lessees will meet their obligations to make maintenance reserve payments or perform required scheduled maintenance or, to the extent that maintenance reserve payments are insufficient, to cover the cost of refurbishments or repairs.\nFailures by lessees to meet their maintenance and recordkeeping obligations under our leases could adversely affect the value of our leased engines and aircraft and our ability to lease the engines and aircraft in a timely manner following termination of the leases.\nThe value and income producing potential of an engine or aircraft depends heavily on it being maintained in accordance with an approved maintenance system and complying with all applicable governmental directives and manufacturer requirements. In addition, for an engine or aircraft to be available for service, all records, logs, licenses and documentation relating to maintenance and operations of the engine or aircraft must be maintained in accordance with governmental and manufacturer specifications.\nOur leases make the lessees primarily responsible for maintaining the engines or aircraft, keeping related records and complying with governmental directives and manufacturer requirements. Over time, certain lessees have experienced, and may experience in the future, difficulties in meeting their maintenance and recordkeeping obligations as specified by the terms of our leases.\nOur ability to determine the condition of the engines or aircraft and whether the lessees are properly maintaining our assets is generally limited to the lessees\u2019 reporting of monthly usage and any maintenance performed, confirmed by periodic inspections performed by us and third-parties. A lessee\u2019s failure to meet its maintenance or recordkeeping obligations under a lease could result in:\n\u00b7\na grounding of the related engine or aircraft;\n\u00b7\na repossession that would likely cause us to incur additional and potentially substantial expenditures in restoring the engine or aircraft to an acceptable maintenance condition;\n\u00b7\na need to incur additional costs and devote resources to recreate the records prior to the sale or lease of the engine or aircraft;\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nloss of lease revenue while we perform refurbishments or repairs and recreate records; and\n\u00b7\na lower lease rate and/or shorter lease term under a new lease entered into by us following repossession of the engine or aircraft.\nAny of these events may adversely affect the value of the engine, unless and until remedied, and reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. If an engine is damaged during a lease and we are unable to recover from the lessee or though insurance, we may incur a loss.\nOur operating results vary and comparisons to results for preceding periods may not be meaningful.\nDue to a number of factors, including the risks described in this ITEM 1A, our operating results may fluctuate. These fluctuations may also be caused by:\n\u00b7\nthe timing and number of purchases and sales of engines or aircraft;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of maintenance reserve revenues recorded resulting from the termination of long term leases, for which significant amounts of maintenance reserves may have accumulated;\n\u00b7\nthe termination or announced termination of production of particular aircraft and engine types;\n\u00b7\nthe retirement or announced retirement of particular aircraft models by aircraft operators;\n\u00b7\nthe operating history of any particular engine, aircraft or engine or aircraft model;\n\u00b7\nthe length of our operating leases; and\n\u00b7\nthe timing of necessary overhauls of engines and aircraft.\nThese risks may reduce our engine utilization rates, lease margins, maintenance reserve revenues and proceeds from engine sales, and result in higher legal, technical, maintenance, storage and insurance costs related to repossession and the cost of engines being off-lease. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the availability of engines for lease or sale periodically experiences cycles of oversupply and undersupply of given engine models. The incidence of an oversupply of engines may produce substantial decreases in engine lease rates and the appraised and resale value of engines and may increase the time and costs incurred to lease or sell engines.\nWe anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future. As a result, we believe that comparisons to results for preceding periods may not be meaningful and that results of prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nOur customers face intense competition and some carriers are in troubled financial condition.\nCertain lessees may be significantly delinquent in their rental payments and may default on their lease obligations. As of December 31, 2017, we had an aggregate of approximately $8.3 million in lease rent and $5.6 million in maintenance reserve payments more than 30 days past due. Our inability to collect receivables or to repossess engines, aircraft or other leased equipment in the event of a default by a lessee could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the global recession that began in 2008, the commercial aviation industry was negatively affected. The airline industry recovered in the years thereafter and has returned to profitability with some carriers even posting record profits. However, we cannot give assurance that delinquencies and defaults on our leases will not increase during future cyclical downturns in the economy and commercial aviation industry.\nVarious airlines have filed for bankruptcy in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, with some seeking to restructure their operations and others ceasing operations entirely. In the case of airlines that are restructuring, such airlines\n\t\t\noften reduce their flights or eliminate the use of certain types of aircraft and the related engine types. Applicable bankruptcy laws often allow these airlines to terminate leases early and to return our engines or aircraft without meeting the contractual return conditions. In that case, we may not be paid the full amount, or any part, of our claims for these lease terminations. Alternatively, we might negotiate agreements with those airlines under which the airline continues to lease the engine or aircraft, but under modified lease terms. In the case of an airline which has ceased operations entirely, in addition to the risk of nonpayment, we face the enhanced risk of deterioration or total loss of an engine or aircraft while it is under uncertain custody and control. In that case, we may be required to take legal action to secure the return of the engine or aircraft and its records or, alternatively, to negotiate a settlement under which we can immediately recover the engine or aircraft and its records in exchange for waiving subsequent legal claims.\nWe may not be able to repossess an engine or aircraft when the lessee defaults, and even if we are able to repossess the engine or aircraft, we may have to expend significant funds in the repossession, remarketing and leasing of the asset.\nWhen a lessee defaults and such default is not cured in a timely manner we typically seek to terminate the lease and repossess the engine or aircraft. If a defaulting lessee contests the termination and repossession or is under court protection, enforcement of our rights under the lease may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming. We may not realize any practical benefits from our legal rights and we may need to obtain consents to export the engine or aircraft. As a result, the relevant asset may be off-lease or not producing revenue for a prolonged period. In addition, we will incur direct costs associated with repossessing our engine or aircraft. These costs may include legal and similar costs, the direct costs of transporting, storing and insuring the engine or aircraft, and costs associated with necessary maintenance and recordkeeping to make the asset available for lease or sale. During this time, we will realize no revenue from the leased engine or aircraft, and we will continue to be obligated to pay any debt financing applicable to the asset. If an engine is installed on an airframe, the airframe may be owned by an aircraft lessor or other third party. Our ability to recover engines installed on airframes may depend on the cooperation of the airframe owner.\nWe and our customers operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in laws or regulations may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell our engines or aircraft.\nLicenses and consents\nWe and our customers operate in a highly regulated industry. A number of our leases require specific governmental or regulatory licenses, consents or approvals. These include consents for certain payments under the leases and for the export, import or re-export of our engines or aircraft. Consents needed in connection with future leasing or sale of our engines or aircraft may not be received timely or have economically feasible terms. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to lease or sell engines or aircraft.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce, or the \u201cCommerce Department,\u201d regulates exports. We are subject to the Commerce Department\u2019s and the U.S. Department of State\u2019s regulations with respect to the lease and sale of engines and aircraft to foreign entities and the export of related parts. These Departments may, in some cases, require us to obtain export licenses for engines exported to foreign countries. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, enforces regulations related to the import of engines and aircraft into the United States for maintenance or lease and imports of parts for installation on our engines and aircraft.\nWe are prohibited from doing business with persons designated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or \u201cOFAC,\u201d on its \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals List,\u201d and must monitor our operations and existing and potential lessees and other counterparties for compliance with OFAC\u2019s rules. Similarly, sanctions issued by the United Nations, the U.S. government, the European Union or other governments could prohibit or restrict us from doing business in certain countries or with certain persons, and we must monitor our operations and existing and potential lessees and other counterparties for compliance with such sanctions.\nAnti-corruption Laws\nAs a U.S. corporation with significant international operations, we are required to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those combating corruption. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and similar world-wide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit improper payments to foreign\n\t\t\nofficials for the purpose of influencing any official act or decision or securing any improper advantage. The scope and enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations may vary. Although our policies expressly mandate compliance with the FCPA and similarly applicable laws, there can be no assurance that none of our employees or agents will take any action in violation of our policies. Violations of such laws or regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal fines or penalties. Actual or alleged violations could also damage our reputation, be expensive to defend, and impair our ability to do business.\nCivil aviation regulation\nUsers of engines and aircraft are subject to general civil aviation authorities, including the FAA and the EASA, who regulate the maintenance of engines and issue airworthiness directives. Airworthiness directives typically set forth special maintenance actions or modifications to certain engine and aircraft types or series of specific engines that must be implemented for the engine or aircraft to remain in service. Also, airworthiness directives may require the lessee to make more frequent inspections of an engine, aircraft or particular engine parts. Each lessee of an engine or aircraft generally is responsible for complying with all airworthiness directives. However, if the engine or aircraft is off lease, we may be forced to bear the cost of compliance with such airworthiness directives, and if the engine or aircraft is leased, subject to the terms of the lease, if any, we may be forced to share the cost of compliance.\nEnvironmental regulation\nGovernmental regulations of noise and emissions levels may be applicable where the related airframe is registered, and where the aircraft is operated. For example, jurisdictions throughout the world have adopted noise regulations which require all aircraft to comply with Stage III noise requirements. In addition to the current Stage III compliance requirements, the United States and the International Civil Aviation Organization, or \u201cICAO,\u201d have adopted a more stringent set of \u201cStage IV\u201d standards for noise levels which apply to engines manufactured or certified from 2006 onward. At this time, the United States regulations do not require any phase-out of aircraft that qualify only for Stage III compliance, but the European Union has established a framework for the imposition of operating limitations on non-Stage IV aircraft. These regulations could limit the economic life of our engines and aircraft or reduce their value, could limit our ability to lease or sell the non-compliant engines or aircraft or, if modifications are permitted, require us to make significant additional investments in the engines or aircraft to make them compliant.\nThe United States and other jurisdictions are imposing more stringent limits on the emission of nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide emissions from engines, consistent with ICAO standards. These limits generally apply only to engines manufactured after 1999. In 2005, the European Union launched an Emissions Trading System limiting greenhouse gas emissions by various industries and persons, including aircraft operators. Concerns over global warming , climate change or other environmental issues could result in more stringent limitations on the operation of older, non-compliant engines and aircraft.\nAny change to current tax laws or accounting principles making operating lease financing less attractive could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur lessees enjoy favorable accounting and tax treatment by using operating leases. Changes in tax laws or accounting principles that make operating leases less attractive to our lessees could have a material adverse effect on demand for our leases and on our business.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. If there are future changes in GAAP with regard to how we and our customers must account for leases, it could change the way we and our customers conduct our businesses and, therefore, could have the potential to have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, \u201cLeases\u201d (Topic 842). The FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under ASU 2016-02, lessors will account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing U.S. GAAP for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. Unlike current guidance, however, a lease with collectability uncertainties may be classified as a sales-type lease. If collectability of lease\n\t\t\npayments, plus any amount necessary to satisfy a lessee residual value guarantee, is not probable, lease payments received will be recognized as a deposit liability and the underlying assets will not be derecognized until collectability of the remaining amounts becomes probable. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. We plan to adopt this guidance on January 1, 2019, that standard\u2019s effective date, and are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOur aircraft, engines or parts could cause bodily injury or property damage, exposing us to liability claims.\nWe are exposed to potential liability claims if the use of our aircraft, engines or parts is alleged to have caused bodily injury or property damage. Our leases require our lessees to indemnify us against these claims and to carry insurance customary in the air transportation industry, including liability, property damage and hull all risks insurance on our engines and on our aircraft at agreed upon levels. We can give no assurance that one or more catastrophic events will not exceed insurance coverage limits or that lessees\u2019 insurance will cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Any insurance coverage deficiency or default by lessees under their indemnification or insurance obligations may reduce our recovery of losses upon an event of loss.\nWe may not be adequately covered by insurance.\nWhile we maintain contingent insurance covering losses not covered by our lessees\u2019 insurance, such coverage may not be available in circumstances where the lessees\u2019 insurance coverage is insufficient. In addition, if a lessee is not obligated to maintain sufficient insurance, we may incur the costs of additional insurance coverage during the related lease. We are required under certain of our debt facilities to obtain political risk insurance for leases to lessees in specified jurisdictions. We can give no assurance that such insurance will be available at commercially reasonable rates, if at all.\nCurrently, the U.S. government is still offering war risk insurance to U.S.-certificated airlines; however, most foreign governments have ceased this practice, forcing non-U.S. airlines back into the commercial insurance market for this coverage. It is unknown how long the U.S. government will continue to offer war risk insurance and whether U.S.-certificated airlines could obtain war risk insurance in the commercial markets on acceptable terms and conditions.\nWe and our lenders generally are named as additional insureds on liability insurance policies carried by our lessees and are usually the loss payees for damage to our engines and aircraft. We have not experienced any significant aviation-related claims or any product liability claims related to our engines, aircraft or spare parts that were not insured. However, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect upon us. A loss of an aircraft where we lease the airframe, an engine or spare parts could result in significant monetary claims for which there may not be sufficient insurance coverage.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nOur inability to obtain sufficient capital would constrain our ability to grow our portfolio and to increase our revenues.\nOur business is capital intensive and highly leveraged. Accordingly, our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and maintain our operations depends on the availability and cost of debt and equity capital. Additionally, our ability to borrow against our portfolio of engines and aircraft is dependent, in part, on the appraised value of our engines and aircraft. If the appraised value of our engines and aircraft declines, we may be required to reduce the principal outstanding under certain of our debt facilities. Availability under such debt facilities may also be reduced, at least temporarily, as a result of such reduced appraisals.\nThe relatively recent worldwide disruptions in the credit and financial markets increased the risk of adverse effects on our customers and our capital providers (lenders and derivative counter-parties) and therefore on us. The disruptions may also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our continued growth. Although we have adequate debt commitments from our lenders, assuming they are willing and able to meet their contractual obligation to lend to us,\n\t\t\nmarket disruptions may adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity capital to fund future growth, requiring us to rely on internally generated funds. This would lower our rate of capital investment.\nWe can give no assurance that the capital we need will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain sufficient capital, or to renew or expand our credit facilities, could result in increased funding costs and would limit our ability to:\n\u00b7\nmeet the terms and maturities of our existing and future debt facilities;\n\u00b7\nadd new equipment to our portfolio;\n\u00b7\nfund our working capital needs and maintain adequate liquidity; and\n\u00b7\nfinance other growth initiatives.\nOur financing facilities impose restrictions on our operations.\nWe have, and expect to continue to have, various credit and financing arrangements with third parties. These financing arrangements are secured by all or substantially all of our assets. Our existing credit and financing arrangements require us to meet certain financial condition tests. Our revolving credit facility prohibits our declaring or paying dividends on shares of any class or series of our common or preferred stock if an event of default under such facility has or will occur and remains uncured. The agreements governing our debt, including the issuance of notes by WEST II and WEST III, also include restrictive financial covenants. A breach of those and other covenants could, unless waived or amended by our creditors, result in a cross-default to other indebtedness and an acceleration of all or substantially all of our debt. We have obtained such waivers and amendments to our financing agreements in the past, but we cannot provide any assurance that we will receive such waivers or amendments in the future if we require them. If our outstanding debt is accelerated at any time, we likely would have little or no cash or other assets available after payment of our debts, which could cause the value or market price of our outstanding equity securities to decline significantly and we would have few, if any, assets available for distributions to our equity holders in liquidation.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our leases, which could have a negative impact on our margins.\nWe are affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Our lease rates are generally fixed, and a portion of our debt bears variable rate interest based on one-month LIBOR, so changes in interest rates directly affect our lease margins. From time to time, we seek to reduce our interest rate volatility and uncertainty through hedging with interest rate derivative contracts with respect to a portion of our debt. Our lease margins, as well as our earnings and cash flows may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates, to the extent we do not have hedges or other derivatives in place or if our hedges or other derivatives do not mitigate our interest rate exposure from an economic standpoint. We would be adversely affected by increasing interest rates. As reported by British Bankers\u2019 Association, the one-month LIBOR was approximately 1.57% and 0.77% on December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nAn increase in interest rates or in our borrowing margin would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.\nA significant portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at floating rates. As a result, to the extent we have not hedged against rising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase our cost of servicing our debt and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nIn addition, we regularly refinance our indebtedness. If interest rates or our borrowing margins increase between the time an existing financing arrangement was consummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced, the cost of servicing our debt would increase and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\t\t\nWe have risks in managing our portfolio of engines to meet customer needs.\nThe relatively long life cycles of aircraft and jet engines can be shortened by world events, government regulation or customer preferences. We seek to manage these risks by trying to anticipate demand for particular engine and aircraft types, maintaining a portfolio mix of engines that we believe is diversified and that will have long-term value and will be sought by lessees in the global market for jet engines, and by selling engines and aircraft that we expect will experience obsolescence or declining usefulness in the foreseeable future.\nThe WEST II securitization facility includes restrictions and limitations on the sale of engines in that facility including, among others, that (i) the net proceeds from any individual engine sale must be at least 105% of the debt allocated under the facility to that engine, and (ii) the aggregate appraised value of the facility\u2019s engines sold through September 2019 cannot exceed 20% of the total appraised value of the facility\u2019s engines at the inception of the facility plus the value of capitalized modifications to the engines since then, and cannot exceed 30% thereafter. We can give no assurance that we can successfully manage our engine portfolio to reduce these risks.\nThe WEST III securitization facility includes restrictions and limitations on the sale of assets in that facility including, with respect to pro forma limitations on assets subject to part-out agreements, a 15% limitation on sales prior to August 2019 and 20% thereafter, and also, in certain situations, with respect to a 25% limit on assets sold below a specific dollar threshold.\nOur inability to maintain sufficient liquidity could limit our operational flexibility and also impact our ability to make payments on our obligations as they come due.\nIn addition to being capital intensive and highly leveraged, our business also requires that we maintain sufficient liquidity to enable us to contribute the non-financed portion of engine and aircraft purchases as well as to service our payment obligations to our creditors as they become due, despite the fact that the timing and amounts of payments under our leases do not match the timing under our debt service obligations. Our restricted cash is unavailable for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and maintain our operations depends on our ability to continue to maintain sufficient liquidity, cash and available credit under our credit facilities. Our liquidity could be adversely impacted if we are subjected to one or more of the following: a significant decline in lease revenues, a material increase in interest expense that is not matched by a corresponding increase in lease rates, a significant increase in operating expenses, or a reduction in our available credit under our credit facilities. If we do not maintain sufficient liquidity, our ability to meet our payment obligations to creditors or to borrow additional funds could become impaired as could our ability to make dividend payments or other distributions to our equity holders. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nNUMEROUS FACTORS MAY AFFECT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate due to many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nrisks relating to our business described in this Annual Report;\n\u00b7\nsales of our securities by a few stockholders or even a single significant stockholder;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting mandated under GAAP;\n\u00b7\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nour financial condition, performance and prospects;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates by us;\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nthe level, direction and volatility of interest rates and expectations of changes in rates;\n\u00b7\nthe market for securities similar to our common stock; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in our capital structure, including additional issuances by us of debt or equity securities.\nIn addition, the U.S. stock markets have experienced price and volume volatility that has affected many companies\u2019 stock prices, often for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of those companies.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS\nA substantial portion of our lease revenue comes from foreign customers, subjecting us to divergent regulatory requirements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, 84% of our lease revenue was generated by leases to foreign customers. Such international leases present risks to us because certain foreign laws, regulations and judicial procedures may not be as protective of lessor rights as those which apply in the United States. We are also subject to risks of foreign laws that affect the timing and access to courts and may limit our remedies when collecting lease payments and recovering assets. None of our leased engines have been expropriated; however, we can give no assurance that political instability abroad and changes in the policies of foreign nations will not present expropriation risks in the future that are not covered by insurance.\nA substantial portion of our leases require payments in U.S. dollars but many of our customers operate in other currencies; if foreign currencies devalue against the U.S. dollar, our lessees may be unable to make their payments to us.\nA substantial portion of our current leases require that payments be made in U.S. dollars. If the currency that our lessees typically use in operating their businesses devalues against the U.S. dollar, those lessees could encounter difficulties in making payments in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, many foreign countries have currency and exchange laws regulating international payments that may impede or prevent payments from being paid to us in U.S. dollars. Future leases may provide for payments to be made in euros or other foreign currencies. Any change in the currency exchange rate that reduces the amount of U.S. dollars obtained by us upon conversion of future lease payments denominated in euros or other foreign currencies, may, if not appropriately hedged by us, have a material adverse effect on us and increase the volatility of our earnings. If payments on our leases are made in foreign currency, our risks and hedging costs will increase.\nWe operate globally and are affected by our customers\u2019 local and regional economic and other risks.\nWe believe that our customers\u2019 growth and financial condition are driven by economic growth in their service areas. The largest portion of our lease revenues come from Europe. European airline operations are among the most heavily regulated in the world. At the same time, low-cost carriers have exerted substantial competitive and financial pressure on major European airlines. Low-cost carriers are having similar effects in North America and elsewhere.\nOur operations may also be affected by political or economic instability in the areas where we have customers.\nWe may not be able to enforce our rights as a creditor if a lessee files for bankruptcy outside of the United States.\nWhen a debtor seeks protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code, creditors are automatically stayed from enforcing their rights. In the case of United States-certificated airlines, Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code provides certain relief to lessors of aircraft equipment. Section 1110 has been the subject of significant litigation and we can give no assurance that Section 1110 will protect our investment in aircraft or engines in the event of a lessee\u2019s bankruptcy. In addition, Section 1110 does not apply to lessees located outside of the United States and applicable foreign laws may not provide comparable protection.\n\t\t\nLiens on our engines or aircraft could exceed the value of such assets, which could negatively affect our ability to repossess, lease or sell a particular engine or aircraft.\nLiens that secure the payment of repairers\u2019 charges or other liens may, depending on the jurisdiction, attach to engines and aircraft. Engines also may be installed on airframes to which liens unrelated to the engines have attached. These liens may secure substantial sums that may, in certain jurisdictions or for limited types of liens, exceed the value of the particular engine or aircraft to which the liens have attached. In some jurisdictions, a lien may give the holder the right to detain or, in limited cases, sell or cause the forfeiture of the engine or aircraft. Such liens may have priority over our interest as well as our creditors\u2019 interest in the engines or aircraft, either because they have such priority under applicable local law or because our creditors\u2019 security interests are not filed in jurisdictions outside the United States. These liens and lien holders could impair our ability to repossess and lease or sell the engines or aircraft. We cannot give assurance that our lessees will comply with their obligations to discharge third-party liens on our assets. If they do not, we may, in the future, find it necessary to pay the claims secured by such liens to repossess such assets.\nIn certain countries, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an accession to the aircraft and we may not be able to exercise our ownership rights over the engine.\nIn some jurisdictions, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an accession to the aircraft, so that the ownership rights of the owner of the aircraft supersede the ownership rights of the owner of the engine. If an aircraft is security for the owner\u2019s obligations to a third-party, the security interest in the aircraft may supersede our rights as owner of the engine. This legal principle could limit our ability to repossess an engine in the event of a lessee bankruptcy or lease default while the aircraft with the engine installed remains in such a jurisdiction. We may suffer a loss if we are not able to repossess engines leased to lessees in these jurisdictions.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SMALL SIZE AND CORPORATE STRUCTURE\nIntense competition in our industry, particularly with major companies with substantially greater financial, personnel, marketing and other resources, could cause our revenues and business to suffer.\nThe engine and aircraft leasing industry is highly competitive and global. Our primary competitors include GE Engine Leasing, Shannon Engine Support Ltd., Pratt &Whitney, Rolls-Royce Partners Finance and Engine Lease Finance Corporation.\nOur primary competitors generally have significantly greater financial, personnel and other resources, as well as a physical presence in more locations, than we do. In addition, competing engine lessors may have lower costs of capital and may provide financial or technical services or other inducements to customers, including the ability to sell or lease aircraft, offer maintenance and repair services or provide other forms of financing that we do not provide. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect us.\nThere is no organized market for the spare engines or the aircraft we purchase. Typically, we purchase engines and aircraft from commercial aircraft operators, engine manufacturers, MROs and other suppliers. We rely on our representatives, advertisements and reputation to generate opportunities to purchase and sell engines and aircraft. The market for purchasing engine and aircraft portfolios is highly competitive, generally involving an auction bidding process. We can give no assurance that engines and aircraft will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms and in the types and quantities we seek consistent with the diversification requirements of our debt facilities and our portfolio diversification goals.\nSubstantially all of our assets are pledged to our creditors.\nSubstantially all of our assets are pledged to secure our obligations to creditors. Our revolving credit banks have a lien on all of our assets, including our equity in WEST II and WEST III. Due to WEST II\u2019s and WEST III\u2019s bankruptcy remote structure, that equity is subject to the prior payments of WEST II\u2019s and WEST III\u2019s debt and other obligations. Therefore, our rights and the rights of our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets of WEST II or WEST III upon liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or winding up will be subject to the prior claims of WEST II\u2019s or WEST III\u2019s creditors. Similarly, the rights of our shareholders are subject to satisfaction of the claims of our lenders and other creditors.\n\t\t\nWe may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations.\nWe can give no assurance that we will be able to manage effectively the current and potential expansion of our operations, or that if we are successful expanding our operations that our systems, procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations, in which event our business, financial condition, results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAny acquisition or expansion involves various risks, which may include some or all of the following:\n\u00b7\nincurring or assuming additional debt;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and attention from ongoing business operations;\n\u00b7\nfuture charges to earnings related to the possible impairment of goodwill and the write down of other intangible assets;\n\u00b7\nrisks of unknown or contingent liabilities;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in the assimilation of operations, services, products and personnel;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs and delays;\n\u00b7\nrisk that the acquired business does not perform consistently with our growth and profitability expectations;\n\u00b7\nrisk that growth will strain our infrastructure, staff, internal controls and management, which may require additional personnel, time and expenditures; and\n\u00b7\npotential loss of key employees and customers.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on us.\nCompliance with the regulatory requirements imposed on us as a public company results in significant costs that may have an adverse effect on our results.\nAs a public company, we are subject to various regulatory requirements including, but not limited to, compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Compliance with these regulations results in significant additional costs to us both directly, through increased audit and consulting fees, and indirectly, through the time required by our limited resources to address such regulations. We have complied with Section 404a of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of December 31, 2007, completing our annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. We have complied with Section 404b of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of December 31, 2009, and our independent registered public accounting firm audits our internal controls over financial reporting. Such compliance requires us to incur additional costs on audit and consulting fees and requires additional management time that may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.\nGovernmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and operation of all aircraft operated in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, such as the EASA in Europe, regulate aircraft operated in those countries. We include, with the aircraft, engines and related parts that we purchase, lease and sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies\n\t\t\nin other countries. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. With respect to a particular engine or engine component, we utilize FAA and/or EASA certified repair stations to repair and certify engines and components to ensure marketability. The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain product sales to foreign countries require approval or licensing from the U.S. government. Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are effectively controlled by one principal stockholder, who has the power to contest the outcome of most matters submitted to the stockholders for approval and to affect our stock prices adversely if he were to sell substantial amounts of his common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our principal stockholder, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Charles F. Willis, IV, beneficially owned or had the ability to direct the voting of 2,756,181 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Willis effectively controls us and has the power to contest the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our board of directors. In addition, future sales by Mr. Willis of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the potential for such sales, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nOur business might suffer if we were to lose the services of certain key employees.\nOur business operations depend upon our key employees, including our executive officers. Loss of any of these employees, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our business as our key employees have knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace.\nWe are the servicer and administrative agent for the WEST II and WEST III facilities and our cash flows would be materially and adversely affected if we were removed from these positions.\nWe are the servicer and administrative agent with respect to engines in the WEST II and WEST III facilities. We receive monthly fees of 11.5% as servicer (3.5% of which is subordinated in the case of WEST III) and 2.0% as administrative agent of the aggregate net rents actually received by WEST II and WEST III on their engines. We may be removed as servicer and or administrative agent in either or both of our WEST II and WEST III facilities, by an affirmative vote of a requisite number of either or both of the WEST II or WEST III note holders. Such vote could happen upon the occurrence of certain specified events as outlined in the WEST II and WEST III servicing and administrative agency agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the WEST II and WEST III servicing and administrative agency agreements. There can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with these covenants in the future or will not otherwise be terminated as service or administrative agent for the WEST II and WEST III facilities. If we are removed from such role with those facilities, our expenses would increase as our consolidated subsidiaries, WEST II and WEST III, would have to hire an outside provider to replace the servicer and administrative agent functions, and we would be materially and adversely affected. Consequently, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nProvisions in Delaware law and our charter and bylaws might prevent or delay a change of control.\nCertain provisions of law, our amended certificate of incorporation, bylaws and amended rights agreement could make the following more difficult: (1) an acquisition of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, and (2) the removal of incumbent officers and directors.\nOur board of directors has authorized the issuance of shares of 6.5% Series A Preferred Stock and 6.5% Series A-2 Preferred Stock, by us and to Development Bank of Japan Inc. (\u201cDBJ\u201d) with American Stock Transfer and Trust\n\t\t\nCompany, serving as rights agent. The rights agreement could make it more difficult to proceed with and tend to discourage a merger, tender offer or proxy contest. Our amended certificate of incorporation also provides that stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be taken by written consent and, in certain circumstances relating to acquisitions or other changes in control, requires an 80% supermajority vote of all outstanding shares of our common stock. Our bylaws also limit the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice.", "PERMNO": 83969, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "WLFC"}
