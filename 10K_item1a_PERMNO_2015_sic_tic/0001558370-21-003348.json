{"cik": "1724344", "company": "Entasis Therapeutics Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-23", "item_1A": "Item\u202f1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about these material risks, together with the other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\u202f10-K, including our financial statements and related notes hereto, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following material risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline; and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisk Factor Summary\nRisks Resulting from the Current Global Pandemic\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, development programs and access to capital.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\n\u25cf We have incurred significant losses since our inception and we expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u25cf We require substantial additional funding to be able to continue as a going concern and, if we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or altogether cease our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\n\u25cf Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\n\u25cf Provisions in the purchase agreement with Innoviva and related documents may deter or prevent us from raising additional capital to fund our options.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Product Candidates and Preclinical Program\n\u25cf We depend to a large degree on the success of our most advanced product candidates, which are in clinical development but have not completed Phase 3 registration trials. If we do not obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates or if we experience significant delays in doing so, we may never become profitable.\n\u25cf If our current clinical trials for our product candidates, including the ATTACK study, fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\n\u25cf If we or our collaborators experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\n\u25cf We rely on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our product candidates and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\n\u25cf We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of our product candidates, and we may seek additional collaborations in the future. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\n\u25cf Our reliance on third parties to manufacture our product candidates increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products in a timely manner, or such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality.\n\u25cf Our reliance on government funding for certain of our programs adds uncertainty to our research, development and commercialization efforts with respect to those programs and may impose requirements that increase the costs of the research, development and commercialization of product candidates developed under those government-funded programs.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\n\u25cf If we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates, or enter into sales, marketing and distribution agreements with third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates, if and when they are approved.\n\u25cf Even if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Managing Our Growth\n\u25cf We depend on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. If we lose members of our senior management team or other key personnel or are unable to successfully retain, recruit and train qualified researchers, engineering and other personnel, our ability to develop our products could be harmed, and we may be unable to achieve our goals.\n\u25cf Significant disruptions to our information technology systems or data security incidents could result in significant financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm to us.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u25cf If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent production for our technology and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and drugs similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and product candidates may be impaired.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u25cf Our largest shareholder, Innoviva, holds more than 50% of our common stock and, as a result, may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.\n\u25cf The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate or decline, resulting in a substantial loss of your investment.\n\u25cf The issuance of additional shares of stock, or actual or perceived sales by large holders, could depress the market price of our common stock.\n\u25cf If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nRisks Resulting from the Current Global Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, development programs and access to capital, and additional COVID-19 outbreaks may have a similar or worse impact on us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, an unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy in general and large and small businesses in particular. Stay-at-home orders, limitations on building occupancy and sizes of gatherings as well as social distancing requirements have resulted in the closure or limitations on the use of corporate offices and factories and disrupted business operations as employers and workforces adapt to new working conditions and requirements. Since the onset of the pandemic, the majority of our employees have been working remotely and our laboratory workers have operated in reduced and/or staggered shifts. As healthcare systems focus on patients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, global clinical trials, including our two Phase 3 registration trials, have seen declines in activity or have been suspended temporarily. For instance, for our ATTACK Phase 3 registration trial, some clinical sites in high COVID-19 impact areas periodically delayed new patient enrollment due to redirection of resources or hospital access restrictions as required by local conditions. For our zoliflodacin Phase 3 registration trial, GARDP, with our full agreement, had temporarily paused patient enrollment and activation of new clinical trial sites in March 2020. In June 2020, GARDP resumed patient enrollment into the Phase 3 registration trial at U.S. sites and a new clinical trial site in the Netherlands. However, we have experienced delays in re-activating some U.S. sites and activating additional clinical trial sites in Thailand and South Africa. While we have not experienced material disruptions in our supply chain to date due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it may in the future impact our ability to procure resources, raw materials or components necessary for our development programs. As a result of the unpredictability surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the timelines for completion of our registration trials and earlier-stage development programs may be materially impacted. Because the timing, scope and duration of disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic are unpredictable, we cannot provide guidance for when we anticipate reporting top-line data or completing our zoliflodacin Phase 3 registration trial. Significant delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates are costly and could adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successful commercialization of our product candidates. The nature and extent of the impact remains uncertain as the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the time needed for businesses and healthcare systems to recover remains unknown. Although we are continuing to actively monitor and assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and development programs, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nOur ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by worsening global economic conditions and the continuing disruptions to, and volatility in, financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The continuation of prolonged adverse economic conditions (including due to a resurgence or subsequent waves of COVID-19 infections and delays in completing the distributions of COVID-19 vaccines) could limit our access to financial resources from the capital markets and other sources.\nWe are not yet certain about the full extent of the long-term potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, development programs and access to capital. To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as global economic conditions more generally, it may also heighten many of the other risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are an advanced, clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We have not generated any revenue from the sale of products and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in 2015. Our\nnet loss was $50.5 million and $43.9 million for the years ended December\u202f31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $184.5\u202fmillion. We have funded our operations to date primarily with proceeds from the sale of common stock, warrants and convertible preferred stock. We have also either directly received funding or financial commitments from, or have had our program activities conducted and funded by, the U.S. government through our arrangements with the NIH, NIAID, CARB-X, and the DOD, and have received non-profit awards from GARDP, and upfront and milestone payments of $12.0 million, research support funding of $0.6 million and other reimbursable registration trial costs of $4.2 million, less applicable taxes, from our license and collaboration agreement with Zai Lab.\nWe have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials. We are still in the early stages of development of our product candidates, and we have not completed development of any drugs. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n\u25cf continue our ongoing and planned preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u25cf initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional product candidates that we may pursue in the future;\n\u25cf seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n\u25cf seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u25cf ultimately establish sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain regulatory approval and intend to commercialize on our own;\n\u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf hire additional clinical, scientific, and chemistry, manufacturing and controls personnel;\n\u25cf add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and\n\u25cf incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses associated with operating as a public company.\nTo become and remain profitable, we and our collaborators must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing drugs that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval, manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, as well as discovering and developing additional product candidates. We are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our common stock and could impair our\nability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our common stock could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe commenced active operations in 2015, and our operations to date have been largely focused on raising capital, identifying and developing our product candidates and preclinical program, broadening our expertise in the development of our product candidates, and undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical trials. As an organization, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully complete Phase\u202f3 registration trials, obtain regulatory approvals, manufacture a commercial-scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nWe may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known or unknown factors in achieving our business objectives. We will need to transition at some point from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.\nWe expect our financial condition and operating results to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, you should not rely upon the results of any quarterly or annual periods as indications of future operating performance.\nWe require substantial additional funding to be able to continue as a going concern and to pursue our business objectives. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or altogether cease our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nAbsent any additional financing, our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 are expected to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the end of the first quarter of 2022, but are not sufficient to sustain our operations in the long term. We will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations and planned activities. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the timing, progress and results of our ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials of other product candidates that we may pursue;\n\u25cf the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we may pursue;\n\u25cf the amount of funding that we receive under our government awards and government awards that we have applied for;\n\u25cf our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u25cf the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u25cf the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\u25cf the costs of operating as a public company; and\n\u25cf the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of drugs that we do not expect to be commercially available until at least 2023, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or altogether cease our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and potential collaboration, license and development agreements and government/non-profit grants and awards. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to a third party to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s securities purchase agreement with Innoviva Inc. and related documents may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital to fund our operations.\nProvisions in the agreements we entered into in April 2020 in connection with the First Private may deter or prevent us from raising additional capital to fund our operations as and when needed. For example, the Investor Rights Agreement we entered into with Innoviva in connection with the First Private Placement provides participation rights for Innoviva to participate pro rata in our future offerings of securities. These and other provisions in the First Private Placement documents could deter or prevent us from raising additional capital. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative effect on our financial condition and our ability to develop and commercialize our pipeline and otherwise pursue our business strategy and we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December\u202f31, 2020, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $119.8 million and $121.2\u202fmillion, respectively. We do not anticipate generating revenue from sales of products for the foreseeable future, if ever, and we may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate tax losses, unused losses generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017 will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. Unused tax losses generated after December 31, 2017 under the Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, will not expire and may be carried forward indefinitely, but will be deductible only to the extent of 80% of current taxable income in any given year. It is uncertain if and to what extent various U.S. states will conform to the Tax Act. Under Sections\u202f382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50\u202fpercentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change U.S. federal income or U.S. federal taxes may be limited. We have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future and/or subsequent shifts in our share ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). As a result, if we earn net taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of U.S. state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes, including our state NOLs. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. As a result, even if we attain profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes, which could negatively impact our future cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Product Candidates and Preclinical Program\nWe depend to a large degree on the success of our most advanced product candidates, which are in clinical development but have not completed Phase\u202f3 registration trials. If we do not obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates or if we experience significant delays in doing so, we may never become profitable.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources on the development of our product candidates for the treatment of serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. We expect that a substantial portion of our efforts and expenses over the next few years will be devoted to the development of our current product candidates we develop, in-license or acquire. As a result, our business currently depends heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or will be successfully commercialized even if they receive regulatory approval. The research, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of our product candidates are, and will remain, subject to comprehensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in each target indication. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of any of our clinical trials. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in the United States will prevent us from commercializing and marketing our product candidates. The success of our product candidates and preclinical program will depend on several additional factors, including:\n\u25cf successful completion of preclinical studies and requisite clinical trials;\n\u25cf performing preclinical studies and clinical trials in compliance with the FDA, the EMA or any comparable regulatory authority requirements;\n\u25cf receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf the ability of collaborators to manufacture sufficient quantity of product for development, clinical trials or potential commercialization;\n\u25cf obtaining marketing approvals with labeling for sufficiently broad patient populations and indications, without unduly restrictive distribution limitations or safety warnings, such as black box warnings or a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, program;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates and preclinical program;\n\u25cf making arrangements with third-parties for manufacturing capabilities;\n\u25cf launching commercial sales of products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u25cf acceptance of the therapies, if and when approved, by physicians, patients and third-party payors;\n\u25cf competing effectively with other therapies;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u25cf protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u25cf maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our drugs following approval.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would harm our business. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates or collaborate with others to do so, we will not be able to obtain product revenue in future periods, which could significantly harm our financial position and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nSuccess in preclinical studies or clinical trials may not be indicative of results in future clinical trials.\nSuccess in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product candidate. Our product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in clinical development despite positive results in preclinical studies or having successfully advanced through initial clinical trials. For instance, with respect to SUL-DUR, we cannot guarantee that the dose regimen used in the Phase\u202f3 registration trial will be effective. We cannot guarantee that the rigorous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling approach, including input from the completed Phase\u202f1 clinical trial assessing pharmacokinetics in renally impaired patients and the completed Phase\u202f2 clinical trial in patients with complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTIs, that we used to select the Phase\u202f3 dosing regimen will be validated in the Phase\u202f3 registration trial in patients with Acinetobacter infections. The dose regimen to be used in the single Phase\u202f3 registration trial will be the first evaluation of SUL-DUR in patients with pneumonia and bloodstream infections caused by Acinetobacter. Our observation of SUL-DUR penetration into the lung in the Phase\u202f1 clinical trial may not be predictive of drug exposure in patients with pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter.\nIn addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. As an organization, we have limited experience designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval. There is a high failure rate for drugs and biologic products proceeding through clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, we may experience regulatory delays or rejections because of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of our product candidate development. Any such delays could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf clinical trials of any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of that product candidate.\nWe may not commercialize, market, promote, or sell any product candidate without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authority, and we may never receive such approvals. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans and will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events prior to, during, or because of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u25cf the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authority may change from the views they have expressed to us as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program;\n\u25cf regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u25cf we may not reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results; for example, the mortality rate among patients with Acinetobacter infections is high and may confound the execution and analysis of our Phase\u202f3 registration trial;\n\u25cf we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u25cf we may not be able to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner, if at all, for example because the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate, or we may fail to recruit suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u25cf we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to us to FDA\u2019s satisfaction;\n\u25cf our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u25cf regulators may issue a clinical hold, or regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u25cf the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\u25cf our product candidates, once exposed to greater numbers of patients, may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the clinical trials;\n\u25cf even if our clinical trials are successful, the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities may determine that the overall risk-benefit profiles of our product candidates are insufficient to support marketing authorization; and\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials or other testing of those product candidates, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u25cf be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u25cf not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u25cf obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u25cf obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, such as black box warnings or a REMS program;\n\u25cf be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u25cf be required to remove the product from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs may also increase if we experience delays in testing and we may be required to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, delays of clinical trials may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the continued clinical testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates, an element of our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize a portfolio of product candidates to treat serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. We are seeking to do so by utilizing our targeted-design platform, which uses bacterial genomics and state-of-the-art molecular and\ndynamic models to design active new compounds that target validated mechanisms of resistance. We focus our clinical development on multidrug-resistant pathogens and patients with high, unmet medical needs to leverage the development and regulatory paths available for first-in-class or best-in-class antibiotics. Research efforts to identify and develop product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u25cf competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u25cf product candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u25cf a product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\u25cf a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all;\n\u25cf a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors, if applicable; and\n\u25cf the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may not approve or agree with the intended use of a new product candidate.\nIf we fail to develop and successfully commercialize other current and future product candidates, our business and future prospects may be harmed, and our business will be more vulnerable to any problems that we encounter in developing and commercializing our current product candidates.\nIf we or our collaborators experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate, continue or complete clinical trials of our product candidates that we develop if we and our collaborators are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authority. We have limited experience enrolling patients in our clinical trials and cannot predict how successful we will be in enrolling patients in future clinical trials.\nFor instance, patients involved in our clinical trials are generally in the hospital setting and the decision to participate can be made by the caregiver or doctor. Accordingly, seeking consent for patient participation may become difficult when the family and/or the patient may not be available to consider participation in a clinical trial and the providers/investigators seeking the consent often have no established relationship with the family or patient. The challenges of obtaining consent for patient participation have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as hospitals have imposed restrictions on visitation by friends or family members who may be able to provide consent on behalf of patients. The COVID-19 pandemic may also make patients less willing to seek medical attention or return for follow-up visits post-treatment. In addition, some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials to treat the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors. If we are not successful at enrolling patients in one clinical trial, it may affect when we are able to initiate our next clinical trial, which could result in significant delays in our efforts to pursue regulatory approval of and commercialize our product candidates. Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u25cf the size and nature of the patient population;\n\u25cf the severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u25cf the eligibility criteria for participation in the clinical trial;\n\u25cf the design of the clinical trial;\n\u25cf the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u25cf our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with appropriate experience;\n\u25cf the availability of drugs approved to treat the diseases under study;\n\u25cf the patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u25cf the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\u25cf the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion; and\n\u25cf the impact of public health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdditionally, infections with Acinetobacter are relatively uncommon compared to other serious bacterial infections and finding a sufficient number of suitable patients with Acinetobacter infections, including patients infected with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter, to enroll in ATTACK may be a potential challenge. Patients enrolled into the clinical trial may have up to 48-hours of prior antimicrobial therapy while identification of Acinetobacter using routine microbiologic culture is occurring, but this time window may be insufficient in some cases for identifying Acinetobacter, thereby limiting patient enrollment. To address this issue, we are employing an FDA-cleared rapid diagnostic for the identification of Acinetobacter. We cannot, however, guarantee that each hospital will utilize this rapid diagnostic as part of their screening and enrollment process or if we will be able to implement the rapid diagnostic in every hospital that is participating in ATTACK. Additionally, patients with Acinetobacter infections are generally very sick and, in some cases, may be unconscious and require mechanical ventilation, providing a further potential enrollment challenge. Furthermore, although mortality in some patients is to be expected and is the endpoint of our ongoing Phase\u202f3 registration trial of SUL-DUR, enrollment of near-terminally ill patients could result in a failure to meet our clinical trial endpoints because the patients are too ill to be expected to respond to effective therapy.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in these clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would reduce the capital we have available to support our current and future product candidates and may result in our need to raise additional capital earlier than planned and could cause the value of our common stock to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.\nDuring the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries and discomforts (generally referred to as adverse events), to their doctor. We are required to report adverse events to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Often, it is not possible to determine whether the product candidate being studied caused these conditions. Regulatory authorities may draw different conclusions or require additional testing to confirm these determinations, if they occur. In addition, it is possible that as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and\nmore extensive clinical programs, or as use of these product candidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by subjects. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational drugs are tested in large-scale, Phase\u202f3 clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients on a commercial scale after approval. If additional clinical experience indicates that any of our current product candidates or any future product candidates of ours, has side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side effects, the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, or, if the product candidate has received regulatory approval, such approval may be revoked, which would harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nMoreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenue through their sale may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nAdditionally, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication, or the adoption of a REMS program to ensure that the benefits outweigh its risks, which may include, among other things, a medication guide outlining the risks of the drug for distribution to patients and a communication plan to health care practitioners. Furthermore, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates, several potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw approvals of such product candidate;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or impose distribution or use restrictions;\n\u25cf we may be required to change the way a product candidate is administered or conduct additional clinical trials, including one or more post-market studies;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u25cf we may be required to implement REMS, including the creation of a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf we may need to conduct a recall; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate, if approved, or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the sale of our products and harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or have a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and management resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial drugs or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration,\nlicensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nInterim \u201ctop-line\u201d and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publish interim top-line or preliminary data from our clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or top-line data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects and may cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nTwo of our product candidates are \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors developed in combination with approved \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. If the FDA, the EMA or comparable regulatory authority revokes their approval, we may be unable to obtain approval for our product candidates.\nTwo of our product candidates inhibit one of the most prevalent forms of bacterial resistance, \u03b2-lactamase enzymes, so-named because of their ability to inactivate \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, one of the most commonly used classes of antibiotics. By blocking this resistance mechanism, these product candidates, when administered in combination with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, are designed to restore the efficacy of those antibiotics. Durlobactam is a novel IV, broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, or BLI, that we are developing in combination with sulbactam, an IV \u03b2-lactam antibiotic, for the treatment of a variety of serious multidrug-resistant infections caused by Acinetobacter. ETX0282 is a novel, oral BLI that we are developing in combination with cefpodoxime, an oral \u03b2-lactam antibiotic, for the treatment of cUTIs, including those caused by Enterobacteriaceae.\nWe did not develop or obtain marketing approval for, nor do we manufacture or sell, sulbactam or cefpodoxime or any other currently approved drug that we may study in combination with our product candidates. If the FDA, the EMA or comparable regulatory authority revokes the approval of the drug or drugs in combination with which we determine to develop our product candidates, we may not be able to market our product candidates in such jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, if safety or efficacy issues arise with any of these drugs, we could experience significant regulatory delays, and the FDA, the EMA or comparable regulatory authority may require us to redesign or terminate the applicable clinical trials. In addition, if manufacturing or other issues result in a shortage of supply of the drugs with which we determine to combine with our product candidates, we may not be able to complete their clinical development on our current timeline or at all.\nEven if our product candidates were to receive marketing approval or be commercialized for use in combination with other existing drugs, we would continue to be subject to the risks that the FDA, the EMA or comparable regulatory authority could revoke approval of the drug used in combination with our product candidates or that safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues could arise with these existing drugs.\nDemand for our product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on continued resistance to empirically used broad-spectrum antibiotics and continued use of pathogen identification and resistance profiling.\nEach of our product candidates, is aimed at treating antibiotic resistant gram-negative bacteria of a specific genus and/or species, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or certain strains of Enterobacteriaceae. Typically, when a patient presents with an infection and the bacteria causing the infection is not known or only suspected, a broad-spectrum antibiotic is administered as a first-line empiric treatment pending tests to identify the bacterial pathogen causing the infection and resistance profile. Our product candidates are being developed for use following the identification of the bacterial pathogen and if the resistance profile of the bacterial pathogen suggests that the first-line broad-spectrum antibiotic is not likely to be effective. Our product candidates are designed to\ntreat specific antibiotic-resistant bacteria where broad-spectrum antibiotics are typically not effective due to the development of antibiotic resistance. However, in those cases when first-line treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic has been effective, there would not be a need for second-line treatment with our product candidates. If the bacteria we target become less resistant to existing broad-spectrum antibiotics, or if new broad-spectrum antibiotics are developed that are equally effective against the specific bacteria we target, then the potential demand for our product candidates could be diminished.\nIn addition, while pathogen identification and resistance profiling are common tests that have been employed for decades and are standard practice in hospital microbiology laboratories as a guide for the appropriate use of antibiotics, these tests can be costly and time consuming. If these tests do not remain standard procedure, for example because their coverage and reimbursement status by third-party payors is reduced or eliminated, this could also limit the potential demand for our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our product candidates, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or failing to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.\nWe have engaged contract research organizations, or CROs, to conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials. We also expect to engage CROs for any of our other product candidates that may progress to clinical development. We expect to rely on CROs, as well as other third parties, such as clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct those clinical trials. Agreements with such third parties might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, our product development activities would be delayed.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with regulatory standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Similar regulatory requirements apply outside the United States, including the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for the Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH.\nWe are also required to register certain ongoing clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so by us or third parties can result in FDA refusal to approve applications based on the clinical data, enforcement actions, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nFurthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nIn addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected the interpretation of the trial, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection by the FDA of any new drug application, or NDA, we submit. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\nWe also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute product supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure or regulatory noncompliance on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, resulting in additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of our product candidates, and we may seek additional collaborations in the future. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe have limited capabilities for drug development and do not yet have any capabilities for sales, marketing or distribution. Additionally, our product development programs and the commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. As a result of these factors, we are, and expect to continue to be, dependent on collaborations relating to the development and commercialization of our existing and future product candidates. We currently have a collaborative relationship with Zai Lab to develop durlobactam and SUL-DUR in the Asia-Pacific region and with GARDP to develop zoliflodacin in a Phase\u202f3 registration trial in uncomplicated gonorrhea. We have had and will continue to have discussions on potential partnering opportunities with various pharmaceutical companies. In addition, we may seek third-party collaborators for the development and commercialization of our product candidates, particularly for the development and commercialization of our product candidates outside the United States. Our likely collaborators for any collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies and we may face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. If we fail to enter into or maintain collaborations on reasonable terms or at all, our ability to develop our existing or future product candidates could be delayed, the commercial potential of our products could change, and our costs of development and commercialization could increase. If we enter into any future collaboration arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nOur collaborations with Zai Lab, NIAID and GARDP and any future collaborations we might enter into may pose a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf collaborators often have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u25cf collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected or contractually obligated;\n\u25cf collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u25cf a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such products;\n\u25cf disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u25cf collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our or their intellectual property rights or may use our or their proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate such intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u25cf collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u25cf collaborators may be subject to geo-political actions, natural disasters or other occurrences, including public health epidemics such as the coronavirus currently impacting China and elsewhere;\n\u25cf collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and\n\u25cf collaborators\u2019 decisions may limit the availability of the product supplies required for development, clinical and commercial activities.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our drug development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nThe failure of Zai Lab or GARDP to adequately perform their obligations and responsibilities in the conduct of our Phase\u202f3 registration trials of SUL-DUR and zoliflodacin, respectively, could harm our business because we may not obtain regulatory approval for SUL-DUR or zoliflodacin in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe have entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Zai Lab, pursuant to which they will manage the portion of our Phase 3 registration trial of SUL-DUR for Acinetobacter infections conducted in China. We have also entered into an arrangement with GARDP pursuant to which it is conducting the Phase\u202f3 registration trial of zoliflodacin in patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea. Under our arrangement with Zai Lab, Zai Lab will fund most of our clinical trial costs in China for SUL-DUR, including all costs for our Phase 3 registration trial for Acinetobacter infections. Under our agreement with GARDP, GARDP will fund all the Phase\u202f3 development costs for zoliflodacin, including costs of the manufacture and supply of the product candidate, and will take the lead in Phase\u202f3 clinical development activities. While we expect to provide operational and logistical support for the Phase\u202f3 registration trials, we have limited control of the activities of our collaborators. We cannot control whether our collaborators will devote sufficient time and resources to the Phase\u202f3 registration trials. If either Zai Lab or GARDP does not successfully carry out its obligations and responsibilities or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data either obtains is compromised due to the failure to adhere to clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, either of the Phase\u202f3 registration trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, SUL-DUR or zoliflodacin. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for SUL-DUR or zoliflodacin would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nAlthough Zai Lab and GARDP are each responsible for conducting specified Phase\u202f3 registration trial activities, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on our collaborators does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We are required to comply with GCP for any product candidate of ours in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical\ntrial sites. If we fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. In addition, we must conduct our clinical trials with drug product manufactured under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements. Failure to comply with any of these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical studies and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur reliance on third parties to manufacture our product candidates increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities to produce clinical or commercial supplies of the product candidates that we are developing or evaluating. We have limited personnel with experience in drug manufacturing and lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We currently rely on third parties for supply of our product candidates, and our strategy is to outsource all manufacturing of our product candidates and approved products, if any, to third parties.\nTo conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, we will need to identify suitable manufacturers with the capabilities to manufacture our compounds in large quantities in a manner consistent with existing regulations. Our third-party manufacturers may be unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition, quality issues may arise during scale-up activities and at any other time. If our manufacturers are unable to successfully scale up the manufacture of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, the development, testing and clinical trials of that product candidate may be delayed, or infeasible, and regulatory approval or commercial launch of that product candidate may be delayed or not obtained, which could significantly harm our business.\nIn addition, we plan to develop certain product candidates for use as a fixed-dose combination therapy. If manufacturing or other issues result in a supply shortage of sulbactam, cefpodoxime or any other currently approved drug that we may study in combination with durlobactam, ETX0282 or any of our future product candidates, we may not be able to complete clinical development of our product candidates on our current timeline or at all.\nWe do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of any of our product candidates. In the future, we may be unable to enter into agreements with third-party manufacturers for commercial supplies of our product candidates or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms.\nEven if we can establish and maintain arrangements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, including:\n\u25cf reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u25cf the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u25cf the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u25cf the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us; and\n\u25cf supply chain disruptions due to geo-political actions, natural disasters or public healthy crises, including epidemics such as the coronavirus.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with\napplicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates.\nOur product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. Furthermore, we intend to develop certain product candidates as a fixed-dose combination with\u202f\u03b2-lactams and only a limited number of cGMP manufacturers are capable of handling \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.\nIf the third parties that we engage to supply any materials or manufacture product for our preclinical tests and clinical trials should cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience delays in advancing these trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers, and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates or the substances used to manufacture them or any of the approved drugs we use in our combination trials, it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe may not be able to win government or non-profit contracts or grants to fund our product development activities.\nHistorically, we have relied in part on funding from contracts or grants from government agencies and non-profit entities and it is part of our strategy to continue to do so. Such contracts or grants can be highly attractive because they provide capital to fund the on-going development of our product candidates without diluting our stockholders. However, there is often significant competition for these contracts or grants. Entities offering contracts or grants may have requirements to apply for or to otherwise be eligible to receive certain contracts or grants that our competitors may be able to satisfy that we cannot. In addition, such entities may make arbitrary decisions as to whether to offer contracts or make grants, to whom the contracts or grants will be awarded and the size of the contracts or grants to each awardee. Even if we can satisfy the award requirements, there is no guarantee that we will be selected to receive any contract or grant. If we are not successful in achieving this form of funding for our clinical trials, we will need to seek alternative means of funding which may not be available to the same extent, if at all.\nOur reliance on government funding for certain of our programs adds uncertainty to our research, development and commercialization efforts with respect to those programs and may impose requirements that increase the costs of the research, development and commercialization of product candidates developed under those government-funded programs.\nAspects of our development programs are currently being supported, in part, with funding from the NIH, NIAID, CARB-X and the DOD. Contracts and grants awarded by the U.S. government, its agencies and its partners, including our awards from the NIH, NIAID, CARB-X and the DOD, include provisions that reflect the government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n\u25cf terminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason at all;\n\u25cf provide grant support to potential competitor programs;\n\u25cf reduce or modify the government\u2019s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;\n\u25cf claim rights, including intellectual property rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n\u25cf audit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u25cf suspend the contractor or grantee from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u25cf impose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n\u25cf suspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government;\n\u25cf control and potentially prohibit the export of products;\n\u25cf pursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements; and\n\u25cf limit the government\u2019s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the U.S. Congress on a fiscal-year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period.\nWe may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using certain technologies developed by us, and we may not be able to prohibit third-party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts.\nIn addition, government contracts and grants, and subcontracts and subawards awarded in the performance of those contracts and grants, normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u25cf specialized accounting systems unique to government awards;\n\u25cf mandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u25cf adhering to stewardship principals imposed by CARB-X as a condition of the award;\n\u25cf public disclosures of certain award information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n\u25cf mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nAs an organization, we are relatively new to government contracting and new to the regulatory compliance obligations that such contracting entails. If we fail to maintain compliance with those obligations, we may be subject to potential liability and termination of our contracts.\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to financial audits and other reviews by the U.S. government of our costs and performance on their contracts, as well as our accounting and general business practices related to these contracts. Based on the results of its audits, the government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates, or enter into sales, marketing and distribution agreements with third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates, if and when they are approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval, we will need to establish a sales and marketing organization or enter into collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize our product candidates. In the United States, we intend to build a commercial organization to target hospitals with the greatest incidence of serious and life-threatening multidrug-resistant infections and recruit experienced sales, marketing and distribution professionals. The development of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities will require substantial resources, will be time-consuming and could delay any product launch. We plan to work with multi-national pharmaceutical companies to leverage their commercialization capabilities to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain regulatory approval outside of the United States.\nIf the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing and distribution capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization costs. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. In addition, we may not be able to hire a sales force in the United States that is sufficient in size or has adequate expertise to target the hospital setting that we intend to target. If we are unable to establish a sales force and marketing and distribution capabilities, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our drugs on our own include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and limitations regarding setting up a distribution network.\nIf we are unable to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in the United States and, instead, enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services, our product revenues and our profitability, if any, are likely to be lower than if we were to sell, market and distribute any product candidates that we develop ourselves. We intend to use collaborators to assist with the commercialization outside the United States of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have limited control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our product candidates effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nEven if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if we obtain approvals from the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory agencies and can initiate commercialization of a product candidate we develop, the product candidate may not achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals, including pharmacy directors, and third-party payors and, ultimately, may not be commercially successful. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on several factors, including:\n\u25cf the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the potential and perceived advantages and disadvantages of the product candidates, including cost and clinical benefit relative to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u25cf acceptance by physicians, patients, operators of hospitals, including in-hospital formularies, and treatment facilities and parties responsible for coverage and reimbursement of the product;\n\u25cf the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u25cf the ability to manufacture our product in sufficient quantities and yields;\n\u25cf the strength and effectiveness of marketing and distribution support;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the product\u2019s approved labeling or an approved REMS;\n\u25cf whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy for particular infections;\n\u25cf the approval of other new products for the same indications;\n\u25cf the timing of market introduction of the approved product as well as competitive products;\n\u25cf the emergence of bacterial resistance to the product; and\n\u25cf the rate at which resistance to other drugs in the target infections grow.\nAny failure by any of our product candidates that obtains regulatory approval to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition from major multi-national pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and\ngeneric drug companies with respect to our current and future product candidates. There are several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the treatment of drug-resistant infections. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective, more effectively marketed and sold or less costly than our product candidates, which could render our product candidates non-competitive and obsolete.\nWe are initially developing SUL-DUR for the treatment of pneumonia and bloodstream infections caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter. Due to rising resistance rates, standard-of-care treatment for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter often includes a combination of several last-line treatment options, including carbapenems, tetracyclines and polymyxins, all generically available agents. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any marketed antibiotic that is indicated for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections; however, we are aware of other potentially competitive products that have shown in vitro activity against some strains of Acinetobacter.\nWe are initially developing zoliflodacin for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea due to N. gonorrhoeae infections, including multidrug-resistant strains. Gonorrhea is commonly treated with the combination therapy of intramuscular ceftriaxone injection and oral azithromycin, both generically available agents. Additional generic cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones are also prescribed, but not recommend as primary treatment options given current resistance rates. Gepotidacin, currently under development for a variety of infections by GlaxoSmithKline\u202fplc, is the only potentially competitive product candidate in clinical development that we are aware of that is addressing gonorrhea.\nWe are initially developing ETX0282CPDP for the treatment of cUTIs, including those caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. There are a variety of generically available antibiotic classes available for the treatment of such infections, including cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. Additionally, there are several IV approved branded agents targeting multidrug-resistant cUTIs. We are aware of additional potentially competitive oral product candidates that may address a limited breadth of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.\nIf our competitors obtain marketing approval from the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities for their product candidates more rapidly than we do, it could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do as an organization. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any product candidates that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain approval from the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory agencies for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in product approval delays if a competitor obtains market exclusivity from the FDA or the EMA, or our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs. Additional drugs may become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic drugs.\nCoverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available for our current or any future product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell profitably, if approved.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any product candidates that we commercialize will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these drugs and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government health care programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and other private health insurers. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. One payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the drug. Additionally, a third-party payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a therapy does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Each payor determines whether it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its list of covered drugs, or formulary, it will be placed. The position on a payor\u2019s formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our drugs, and providers are unlikely to prescribe our drugs, unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our drugs and their administration.\nA primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any drug that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Inadequate coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any drug for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our current and any future product candidates that we develop.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any drugs that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy;\n\u25cf decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u25cf product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf significant costs to defend the resulting litigation;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards paid to clinical trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf loss of revenue; and\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize any drugs that we may develop.\nWe currently hold $10.0\u202fmillion in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $10.0\u202fmillion, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or if we commence commercialization of our product candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nThere are a variety of risks associated with marketing our product candidates internationally, which could affect our business.\nWe or our collaborators may seek regulatory approval for our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n\u25cf differing regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n\u25cf the potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market with low or lower prices rather than buying them locally;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in foreign economies and markets;\n\u25cf compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u25cf foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u25cf foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u25cf difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u25cf various reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes;\n\u25cf potential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u25cf challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u25cf production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u25cf business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods, fires, and public health epidemics, such as the coronavirus outbreak currently impacting China and elsewhere.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may compromise our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Managing Our Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the management, research and development, clinical, financial and business development expertise of Manoussos Perros, Ph.D., our chief executive officer, Michael Gutch, Ph.D., our chief financial officer and chief business officer, David Altarac, M.D., our chief medical officer, John Mueller, Ph.D., our chief development officer, Ruben Tommasi, Ph.D., our chief scientific officer, and Matt Ronsheim, Ph.D., our chief pharmaceutical sciences and manufacturing officer, as well as the other members of our scientific and clinical teams. Although we have employment agreements with our executive officers, each of them may nevertheless terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or employees.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific and clinical personnel and, if we progress the development of any of our product candidates, commercialization, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, will be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize our product candidates. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nWe expect to expand our development and regulatory capabilities and potentially implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020 we had 47 full-time employees. As the clinical development of our product candidates progresses, we also expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of research, drug development, regulatory affairs and, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, sales, marketing and distribution. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and drugs similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and product candidates may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our technology and product candidates. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage that we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. To protect our proprietary positions, we file patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and product candidates that are important to our business.\nThe patent application and prosecution process are expensive and time-consuming. We and our current licensees, or any future licensors and licensees may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We or our current licensees, or any future licensors or licensees may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nTherefore, these and any of our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. If our current licensees, or any future licensors or licensees, are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised, and we might not be able to prevent third parties from making, using and selling competing products. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid and/or unenforceable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States or in many foreign jurisdictions. For example, European patent law currently restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. In addition, the determination of patent rights with respect to pharmaceutical compounds and technologies commonly involves complex legal and factual questions, which has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Furthermore, recent changes in patent laws in the United States, including the America Invents Act of 2011, may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings that may be brought by us related to our patent rights.\nWe may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our current and future our product candidates. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18\u202fmonths after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Similarly, should we own any patents or patent applications in the future, we may not be certain that we were the first to file for patent protection for the inventions claimed in such patents or patent applications. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity and commercial value of our patent rights cannot be predicted with any certainty. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or become\ninvolved in derivation, ex-parte reexamination, or inter partes review proceedings in the USPTO or similar proceedings elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nOur pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Even if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. Our competitors may seek to market generic versions of any approved products by submitting abbreviated new drug applications to the FDA in which they claim that patents owned or licensed by us are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. Alternatively, our competitors may seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our products. In these circumstances, we may need to defend and/or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or other agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid and/or unenforceable.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate, a patent being held unenforceable, and/or in one or more or in patent claims being narrowed or invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest filing date of a non-provisional application to which the patent claims priority. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product candidate, we may be open to competition from competitive medications, including generic medications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing product candidates similar or identical to ours.\nIn addition, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. Depending upon the timing, duration and conditions of any FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the European Union, as discussed above. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case, and our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors and other third parties may infringe our issued patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable or that one or more claims of a patent are invalid, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the basis that our patents do not cover the invention. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\nIn any infringement litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive because of the proceedings. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a negative impact on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could significantly harm our business.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary chemistry technology without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous third-party U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents exist in the area of antibacterial treatment, including compounds, formulations, treatment methods and synthetic processes that may be applied towards the synthesis of antibiotics. If any of their patents cover our product candidates or technologies, we may not be free to manufacture or market our product candidates as planned.\nThere is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technology or product candidates, including interference proceedings before the USPTO. Intellectual property disputes arise in several areas including with respect to patents, use of other proprietary rights and the contractual terms of license arrangements. Third parties may assert claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance.\nIf we are found to infringe a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third party to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative effect on our business.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property rights, including patent rights, that are important or necessary to the development of our product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and we could be forced to accept unfavorable contractual terms. If we are unable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our technology, product candidates, or the methods for manufacturing them or to develop or license replacement technology, all of which may not be feasible on a technical or commercial basis. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected technology and product candidates, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees, consultants or contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties, or we have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers, or claims asserting we have misappropriated their intellectual property or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of third parties in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. We may also in the future be subject to claims that we have caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these potential claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, such employees and contractors may breach the agreement and claim the developed intellectual property as their own.\nOur business was founded in 2015 as a spin-out from AstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca. Although all patent applications are fully owned by us and were either filed by AstraZeneca with all rights fully transferred to us, or filed in our sole name, because we acquired certain of our patents from AstraZeneca, we must rely on their prior practices, regarding the assignment of such intellectual property. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or\nother proprietary information of the former employers. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. In addition, any litigation or threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent service providers. Moreover, a loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products.\nAny trademarks we may obtain may be infringed or successfully challenged, resulting in harm to our business.\nWe expect to rely on trademarks as one means to distinguish any of our product candidates that are approved for marketing from the products of our competitors. Once we select trademarks and apply to register them, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. If our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nIn addition, any proprietary name we propose to use with a product candidate in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to identify a suitable proprietary product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent and trademark protection for our product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets. Despite these efforts and the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information due to our reliance on third parties, increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements.\nMonitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.\nMoreover, our competitors may independently develop knowledge, methods and know-how equivalent to our trade secrets. Competitors could purchase our products and replicate some or all the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts for technologies on which we do not have patent protection. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States could be less extensive than those in the United States. In some cases, we may not be able to obtain patent protection for certain licensed technology outside the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States, even in jurisdictions where we do pursue patent protection. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, even in jurisdictions where we do pursue patent protection or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions.\nCompetitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not pursued and obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and preclinical programs and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, if pursued and obtained, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nEven if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or any future collaborators from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. As a result, we cannot predict when or if, and in which territories, we, or any future collaborators, will obtain marketing approval to commercialize a product candidate.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, research, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, quality control, recordkeeping, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, export, and reporting of safety and other post-market information, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory agencies. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to market any of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third-party CROs to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit its approved use more narrowly than we anticipate, which could limit sales of the product.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. The FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may determine that our product candidates are not safe and effective, only moderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nIn addition, changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. Any marketing approval we, or any future collaborators, ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be impaired.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed in these territories. Any approval we are granted for our product candidates in the United States would not assure approval of our product candidates in foreign jurisdictions.\nTo market and sell our products in the European Union, or EU, and any other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain approval from the FDA. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all the risks associated with obtaining approval from the FDA. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, denial of approval in one jurisdiction may impact our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nEven if we obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products and compliance with such requirements may involve substantial resources, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nEven if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation, including the potential requirements to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or to conduct costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we will not be able to promote any products\nwe develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved. In addition, manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We and our contract manufacturers could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMP. We must also comply with FDA requirements for adverse event reporting for commercial products.\nAccordingly, assuming we receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we and our contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any future products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Thus, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or recall or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nThe FDA and other federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, closely regulate compliance with all requirements governing prescription drug products, including requirements pertaining to marketing and promotion of drugs in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and manufacturing of products in accordance with cGMP requirements. The FDA and DOJ impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of such requirements may lead to investigations alleging violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act and other federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws as well as state consumer protection laws.\nOur failure to comply with all regulatory requirements, and later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, may yield various results, including:\n\u25cf litigation involving patients taking our products;\n\u25cf restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u25cf restrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u25cf requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf warning or untitled letters;\n\u25cf withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u25cf recall of products;\n\u25cf fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u25cf damage to relationships with any potential collaborators;\n\u25cf unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n\u25cf refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u25cf product seizure; or\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nNon-compliance by us or any future collaborator with regulatory requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nNon-compliance with U.K. and EU requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, also can result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the U.K.\u2019s or EU\u2019s requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, CMOs, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct or failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Misconduct by employees and independent contractors, such as principal investigators, CROs, consultants, commercial partners and vendors, could include failures to comply with regulations of the FDA, the EMA and other comparable regulatory authorities, to provide accurate information to such regulators, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. Sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including, but not limited to, research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee and independent contractor misconduct could also involve the improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained during clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. In addition, federal procurement laws impose substantial penalties for misconduct in connection with government contracts and require certain contractors to maintain a code of business ethics and conduct. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee and independent contractor misconduct, and any precautions we take to detect and prevent improper activities may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws. If any such actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur current and future relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to penalties.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, sell, market and distribute any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to physician payment transparency laws and patient privacy and security regulation by the federal government and by the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n\u25cf the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u25cf the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;\n\u25cf the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal and civil statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on \u201ccovered entities,\u201d including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective \u201cbusiness associates\u201d that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under Section\u202f6002 of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which created annual reporting requirements for manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for certain payments and \u201ctransfers of value\u201d provided to\ncovered recipients, including physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u25cf analogous state and foreign laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or to adopt compliance programs as prescribed by state laws and regulations, or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the licensure of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nFurther, the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nEfforts to ensure that our future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and pursue our strategy. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, including future collaborators, are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also affect our business.\nFuture legislation, and/or regulations and policies adopted by the FDA, the EMA or comparable regulatory authorities, may increase the time and cost required for us or our collaborators to conduct and complete clinical trials of our current and future product candidates.\nThe FDA and the EMA have each established regulations to govern the product development and approval process, as have other foreign regulatory authorities. The policies of the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities may change. For example, in December\u202f2016, the 21st\u202fCentury Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and spur innovation, but not all its provisions have yet been implemented. Additionally, in August\u202f2017, the FDA issued final guidance setting forth its current thinking with respect to development programs and clinical trial designs for antibacterial drugs to treat serious bacterial diseases in patients with an unmet medical need. We cannot predict what if any effect the Cures Act or any existing or future guidance from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will have on the development of our product candidates.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us and our collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nAmong policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access.\nOther federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States. For example, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 ended the use of the statutory formula for clinician payment and established a quality payment incentive program, also referred to as the Quality Payment Program. This program provides clinicians with two ways to participate, including through the Advanced Alternative Payment Models, or APMs, and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS. In November 2019, CMS issued a final rule finalizing the changes to the Quality Payment Program. It is unclear how payment reductions or the introduction of the Quality Payment Program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. It is also unclear if changes in Medicare payments to providers would impact such providers\u2019 willingness to prescribe and administer our products, if approved.\nFurther, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the way companies set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for drugs. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nOur product candidates may be subject to government price controls that may affect our revenue.\nThere has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States and abroad of pharmaceutical pricing practices considering the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. In the United States, such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the former Trump Administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2020 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part\u202fD plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part\u202fB, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. The former Trump Administration also released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of\npocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS\u2019s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule through the CMS Innovation Center whereby Medicare Part B reimbursement for \u201ccertain high-cost prescriptions drugs\u201d would be no more than most-favored-nation price (i.e., the lowest price) after adjustments, for a pharmaceutical product that the drug manufacturer sells in a member country of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that has a comparable per-capita gross domestic product. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. While some of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, members of Congress have and the new Biden Administration have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Outside of the United States, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, import and customs laws, trade and economic sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or the Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201, the U.S. Travel Act, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The Bribery Act, the FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of value, to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage.\nUnder the Bribery Act, we may also be liable for failing to prevent a person associated with us from committing a bribery offense. We, our collaborators, and those acting on our behalf operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and we participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose corrupt or illegal activities could potentially subject us to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA or local anticorruption laws, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nCompliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and these other laws is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, anti-corruption laws present challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to enforcement actions.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions and embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws.\nThere is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the Bribery Act, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by United States, United Kingdom or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, the failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRecent and potential future changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws could materially adversely affect our company.\nExisting, new or future changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties, or the interpretation thereof, in addition to tax policy initiatives and reforms under consideration in the United States or internationally and other initiatives could have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses. Furthermore, countries where we are subject to taxes, including the United States, are independently evaluating their tax policy and we may see significant changes in legislation and regulations concerning taxation. On December\u202f22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Act, which significantly revised the Code. The Tax Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. Other legislative changes could also affect the taxation of holders of our common stock. We are unable to predict what tax reform may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices, could affect our effective tax rates in the future in countries where we have operations and have an adverse effect on our overall tax rate in the future, along with increasing the complexity, burden\nand cost of tax compliance. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to any such legislative changes and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nInnoviva, Inc. may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Innoviva, held approximately 51.0% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and accordingly controls approximately 51.0% of our voting power. Innoviva\u2019s large ownership stake may allow it to exert a significant influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially including amendments to our certificate of incorporation, election of our board of directors, removal of any of our directors, adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover, or other business combination involving us, and approval of other major corporate transactions. In addition, Innoviva\u2019s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price. Accordingly, our stockholders other than Innoviva may be unable to influence management and exercise control over our business.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSince our initial public offering, our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume. The stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the price paid for the shares. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, these factors include:\n\u25cf the commencement, enrollment or results of our planned and future clinical trials;\n\u25cf the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf adverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials or manufacturers;\n\u25cf changes or developments in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates and preclinical program;\n\u25cf changes to our relationships with collaborators, manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u25cf the results of our testing and clinical trials;\n\u25cf unanticipated safety concerns;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our competitors or the pharmaceutical industry in general;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf changes in our financial results, including our ability to continue as a going concern, or changes of recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf potential acquisitions;\n\u25cf the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates;\n\u25cf the trading volume of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us, our executive officers and directors or our stockholders or the anticipation that such sales may occur in the future;\n\u25cf general economic, political and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the financial markets in the United States or the United Kingdom;\n\u25cf stock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the biopharmaceutical industry; and\n\u25cf investors\u2019 general perception of us, our business and the antibiotic sector.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from selling their shares of our common stock at or above the price paid for the shares and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general, and biopharmaceutical companies, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.\nSome companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their shares have been the subject of securities class action litigation. Any lawsuit to which we are a party, with or without merit, may result in an unfavorable judgment. We also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines, damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our business practices. Defending against litigation is costly and time-consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention and our resources. Furthermore, during litigation, there could be negative public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, which could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe issuance of additional shares of stock, or actual or perceived sales by large holders, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 125,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules\u202fand regulations, we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plans or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur common stock is concentrated in several shareholders who hold large positions. For example, Innoviva, held 51.0% of our issued and outstanding common stock and AstraZeneca held 5.9% of our issued and outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020. If holders of large numbers of our shares sell a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public markets, or if there is the perception that such sales could occur, such sales could depress the market price of our shares of common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict neither the number of shares that might be sold by our current or future\ninvestors nor the effect that future sales of our shares of common stock would have on the market price of our shares of common stock.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions and matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, greater than 50% of our outstanding common stock, based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020. As a result, these persons, acting together, would be able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all our assets, or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. In addition, these persons, acting together, may have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by: delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control; entrenching our management and/or the board of directors; impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us; or by discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make the acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u25cf establish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u25cf allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u25cf limit the way stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u25cf require that stockholder actions must be affected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u25cf limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a stockholder rights plan, or so-called \u201cpoison pill,\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u25cf require the approval of the holders of at least 662/3% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section\u202f203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired more than 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and because of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including:\n\u25cf not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u25cf not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u25cf reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u25cf not being required to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe currently take advantage of some or all these reporting exemptions and we may continue to do so until we are no longer an emerging growth company, or EGC. We will remain an EGC until the earlier of (1)\u202fthe last day of 2023, (2)\u202fthe last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07\u202fbillion, (3)\u202fthe last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700\u202fmillion as of the prior June\u202f30th, and (4)\u202fthe date on which we have issued more than $1.0\u202fbillion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nUnder Section\u202f107(b)\u202fof the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nOur internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section\u202f404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or other regulatory authorities.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our cash and cash equivalents and may invest or spend them in ways with which you do not agree and in ways that may not increase the value of your investment.\nOur management will have broad discretion in the application of our cash and cash equivalents and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a negative impact on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of our product candidates and preclinical program. Pending their use, we may invest our cash and cash equivalents in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gains and you may never receive a return on your investment.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. Pursuant to our Business Transfer and Subscription Agreement with AstraZeneca, we also agreed to pay AstraZeneca a one-time milestone payment of $5.0\u202fmillion within three months of achieving a specified cumulative net sales milestone for durlobactam. This milestone payment will be automatically waived should our common stock trade on Nasdaq at or above a specified price at the time we achieve such specified cumulative net sales milestone for durlobactam, subject to adjustment for share splits, dividends and other similar events. We are also obligated to pay AstraZeneca a one-time milestone payment of $10.0\u202fmillion within two years of achieving the first commercial sale of zoliflodacin. Following the achievement of either milestone, we are not permitted to pay dividends or make other distributions to any of our stockholders until the applicable milestone payment has been paid in full or otherwise waived. We have never declared or paid a dividend on our common stock to date, and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, on our common stock will be your sole source of gains for the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nWe incur significantly increased costs because of operating as a company whose common stock is publicly traded in the United States, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur previously. These expenses will likely be even more significant after we no longer qualify as an EGC. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules\u202fand regulations impose various requirements on public companies in the United States, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our senior management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules\u202fand regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules\u202fand regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified senior management personnel or members for our board of directors.\nHowever, these rules\u202fand regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nPursuant to Section\u202f404, we will be required to furnish a report by our senior management on our internal control over financial reporting. However, while we remain an EGC, we will not be required to include an attestation\nreport on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To prepare for compliance with Section\u202f404, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section\u202f404. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could result in significant financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm to us.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit substantial amounts of sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, personal information and other confidential information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such sensitive information. We have also outsourced elements of our operations, including elements of our information technology infrastructure, to third parties and, as a result, we manage several third-party vendors who may or could have access to our computer networks or our confidential information. In addition, many of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their responsibilities to other third parties. While all information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches, incidents, attacks and exposures, the accessibility and distributed nature of our information technology systems, and the sensitive information stored on those systems, make such systems potentially vulnerable to unintentional or malicious, internal and external attacks on our technology environment. Potential vulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors, business partners, or by malicious third parties. Attacks of this nature are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d nation states and others. In addition to the extraction of sensitive information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices increases the risk of data security incidents.\nSignificant disruptions of our, our third-party vendors\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information technology systems or other similar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations and result in the loss, misappropriation, and unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm to us. In addition, information technology system disruptions, whether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.\nThere is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not been discovered. While we have no reason to believe this to be the case, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal access to systems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable federal and state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time-consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to\nverify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational harm. In addition, any failure or perceived failure by us or our vendors or business partners to comply with our privacy, confidentiality or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any further security incidents or other inappropriate access events that result in the unauthorized access, release or transfer of sensitive information, which could include personally identifiable information, may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others, and could cause third parties, including clinical sites, regulators or current and potential partners, to lose trust in us, or we could be subject to claims by third parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations. Moreover, data security incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security, measures intended to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent service interruptions or security incidents.\nIf we engage in future acquisitions or strategic collaborations, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate various acquisitions and strategic collaborations, including licensing or acquiring complementary drugs, intellectual property rights, technologies or businesses, as deemed appropriate to carry out our business plan. Any potential acquisition or strategic collaboration may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf increased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n\u25cf the assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities;\n\u25cf assimilation of operations, intellectual property and drugs of an acquired company, including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel;\n\u25cf the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing drug programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic partnership, merger or acquisition;\n\u25cf retention of key employees, the loss of key personnel and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships;\n\u25cf risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing drugs or drug candidates and regulatory approvals; and\n\u25cf our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or drugs sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nTax authorities may disagree with our positions and conclusions regarding certain tax positions, resulting in unanticipated costs, taxes or non-realization of expected benefits.\nA tax authority may disagree with tax positions that we have taken, which could result in increased tax liabilities. For example, the Internal Revenue Service or another tax authority could challenge our allocation of income by tax jurisdiction and the amounts paid between our affiliated companies pursuant to our intercompany arrangements and transfer pricing policies, including amounts paid with respect to our intellectual property development. Similarly, a tax authority could assert that we are subject to tax in a jurisdiction where we believe we have not established a taxable connection, often referred to as a \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d under international tax treaties, and such an assertion, if successful, could increase our expected tax liability in one or more jurisdictions. The foregoing are only selected examples of potential challenges, and other tax positions we have taken or may take in the future could become the subject of disputes with one or more tax authorities. A tax authority may take the position that material income tax\nliabilities, interest and penalties are payable by us, in which case, we expect that we might contest such assessment. Contesting such an assessment may be lengthy and costly and if we were unsuccessful in disputing the assessment, the implications could increase our anticipated effective tax rate, where applicable.", "PERMNO": 18113, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ETTX"}
