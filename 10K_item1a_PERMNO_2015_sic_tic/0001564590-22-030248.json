{"cik": "1078271", "company": "EXTREME NETWORKS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-08-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe face a number of risks and uncertainties which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, industry, financial condition, results of operations or future financial performance. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, results of operations, industry, financial position and financial performance in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry\nWe purchase several key components for products from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these suppliers fail to meet our needs. Supply chain constraints have exacerbated this situation.\nWe currently purchase several key components used in the manufacturing of our products from single or limited sources and are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs. At present, semiconductor chips and other components are currently in high demand with limited supply. These shortages have been exacerbated by increased energy, raw material, and transportation costs, which are resulting in higher overall component costs, higher delivery costs for expedited shipments, and significantly longer than usual lead times for these components. If we are unable to mitigate these effects, this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer orders and will negatively impact our gross margin and results of operations. Our principal sole-source components include:\n\u2022\nASICs - merchant silicon, Ethernet switching, custom and physical interface;\n\u2022\nmicroprocessors;\n\u2022\nprogrammable integrated circuits;\n\u2022\nselected other integrated circuits;\n\u2022\ncustom power supplies; and\n\u2022\ncustom-tooled sheet metal.\nOur principal limited-source components include:\n\u2022\nflash memory;\n\u2022\nDRAMs and SRAMs;\n\u2022\nprinted circuit boards;\n\u2022\nCAMs;\n\u2022\nconnectors; and\n\u2022\ntiming circuits (crystals & clocks).\nWe use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements. Lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly, and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for a component at a given time. If forecasts exceed orders, we may have excess and/or obsolete inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. If orders exceed forecasts, we may have inadequate supplies of certain materials and components, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer delivery requirements and to recognize revenue.\nOur top ten suppliers accounted for a significant portion of our purchases during the year. Given the significant concentration of our supply chain, particularly with certain sole or limited source providers, any significant interruption by any of the key suppliers or a termination of a relationship could temporarily disrupt our operations. Additionally, our operations are materially dependent upon the continued market acceptance and quality of these manufacturers\u2019 products and their ability to continue to manufacture products that are competitive and that comply with laws relating to environmental and efficiency standards. Our inability to obtain products from one or more of these suppliers or a decline in market acceptance of these suppliers\u2019 products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not have any material agreements with fixed long-term prices or minimum volume requirements from suppliers. From time to time we have experienced shortages and allocations of certain components, resulting in delays in filling orders. Qualifying new suppliers to compensate for such shortages may be time-consuming and costly and may increase the likelihood of errors in design or production. In addition, during the development of our products, we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our chipsets, which in turn has led to delays in product introductions. Similar delays may occur in the future. Furthermore, the performance of the components from our suppliers as incorporated in our products may not meet the quality requirements of our customers.\nThe extended factory closures in China in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak reduced the capacity of our supply chain and may continue to do so. See also the risk factor below, \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak has had, and continues to have, a materially disruptive effect on our business.\u201d\nOur dependence on a few manufacturers and third parties for our manufacturing, warehousing, and delivery requirements could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe primarily rely on our manufacturing partners Alpha Networks, Senao Networks, Foxconn, Delta Networks, Wistron NeWeb Corporation, Sercomm Corporation, Quanta, and select other partners to manufacture our products. We have experienced delays in product shipments from some of our partners in the past, which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers. These or similar problems may arise in the future, such as delivery of products of inferior quality, delivery of insufficient quantity of products, or the interruption or discontinuance of operations of a manufacturer or other partner, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. While we maintain strong relationships with our manufacturing and other partners, our agreements with these manufacturers are generally of limited duration and pricing, quality, and volume commitments are negotiated on a recurring basis. The failure to maintain continuing agreements with our manufacturing partners or find replacements for them in a timely manner could adversely affect our business. We intend to introduce new products and product enhancements, which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers.\nAs part of our cost-reduction efforts, we will need to realize lower per unit product costs from our manufacturing partners by means of volume efficiencies and the utilization of manufacturing sites in lower-cost geographies. However, we cannot be certain when or if such price reductions will occur, particularly in light of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. The failure to obtain such price reductions would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, any natural disaster, pandemic, or business interruption to our manufacturing partners could significantly disrupt our business. Business interruption could be caused by geopolitical factors, including political or military actions between China and Taiwan, where much of our product and their components are manufactured. Further, some of our products are manufactured in China and are therefore subject to the possibility of additional import tariffs. The U.S. government has previously announced import tariffs on goods manufactured in China. These tariffs, depending upon their ultimate scope, duration and how they are implemented, could negatively impact our business by continuing to increase our costs and by making our products less competitive. We may not be able to pass such increased costs on to our customers. The relocation of contract manufacturing facilities to locations outside of China or Taiwan may increase our costs and could impact the global competitiveness of our products.\nThe coronavirus outbreak has had, and continues to have, a materially disruptive effect on our business.\nThe novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has spread around the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. The spread of COVID-19 and new variants continues to have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Current and potential impacts include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour component suppliers and contract manufacturers have been negatively affected by changes and downturns in the economy resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in product delays and changes in pricing and service levels;\n\u2022\nclosures and slow ramp up of capacity of many factories in China, where our products and the components and subcomponents used in the manufacture of our equipment are manufactured, continue to create supply chain disruptions for Extreme;\n\u2022\nwe have incurred costs such as expedite fees to be assured of supply of components;\n\u2022\nsupply and transportation costs have increased, and may continue to increase, as alternate suppliers are sought;\n\u2022\nairport closures, labor shortages at airports and reductions in passenger flights have reduced capacity and led to a backlog of freight at airport terminals, causing further disruptions to the supply chain;\n\u2022\nlabor shortages within delivery and other industries due to extended worker absences continue to create further supply chain disruptions;\n\u2022\ndemand for Extreme\u2019s products and services, including Extreme\u2019s enterprise-scale products, have been and may continue to be reduced due to, among other things, uncertainties in the global economy and financial markets, cancellation or postponement of large gatherings, reduction in office sizes, as well as reduced customer spending; and\n\u2022\nreductions in earnings could increase our costs of borrowing, reduce our ability to comply with our credit agreement covenants, or make extensions of credit unavailable to us.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 and new variants impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the speed and extent of geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the affected areas, business closures or business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the affected areas to contain and treat the disease.\nWe depend upon international sales for a significant portion of our revenues which imposes a number of risks on our business.\nInternational sales constitute a significant portion of our net revenues. Our ability to grow will depend in part on the expansion of international sales. Our international sales primarily depend on the success of our resellers and distributors. The failure of these resellers and distributors to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenues. There are a number of risks arising from our international business, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection cycles;\n\u2022\nhigher credit risks requiring cash in advance or letters of credit;\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nincreased complexity of accounting rules and financial reporting requirements;\n\u2022\nthe payment of operating expenses in local currencies, which exposes us to risks of currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in local economies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nreduced or limited protection of intellectual property rights, particularly in jurisdictions that have less developed intellectual property regimes, such as China and India;\n\u2022\ndiffering privacy regulations, data localization requirements, and restrictions on cross-border data transfers;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements of foreign countries, including compliance with rapidly evolving environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nimport tariffs imposed by the United States and the possibility of reciprocal tariffs by foreign countries;\n\u2022\ncompliance with export controls, including restrictions on trade with embargoed or sanctioned countries or with denied parties, and rules related to the export of encryption technology\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations pertaining to the sale and distribution of products to customers in foreign countries, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners in certain international markets;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic turbulence or uncertainty;\n\u2022\nterrorism, war or other armed conflict; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, epidemics, and pandemics.\nAny or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSubstantially all of our international sales are United States dollar-denominated. The continued strength and future increases in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets. In the future, we may elect to invoice a larger portion of our international customers in local currency, which would expose us to greater fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the particular local currency. If we do so, we may decide to engage in hedging transactions to minimize the risk of such fluctuations.\nWe have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of payment of operating expenses in local currencies to some of our operating foreign subsidiaries. However, if we are not successful in managing these foreign currency transactions, we could incur losses from these activities.\nThere are compliance risks associated with complex tariff regulations and export control laws. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could incur penalties and sanctions from governments, and could be restricted from exporting products.\nLocal laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from, or conflict with, those in the United States or in other countries in which we operate. In many foreign countries, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with these U.S. and foreign laws and policies, there can be no complete assurance that any individual employee, contractor, channel partner, or agent will not violate our policies and procedures. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners, or agents could result in termination of our relationship, financial reporting problems, fines, and/or penalties for us, or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTo successfully manage our business or achieve our goals, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and promote key employees, and a failure to do so can harm us.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management, engineering, sales and marketing, service and operations personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. We have experienced and may in the future experience significant turnover in our executive personnel. Changes in our management and key employees could affect our financial results, and our prior reductions in force may impede our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We believe our future\nsuccess will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, engineering, sales and marketing, service, finance, and operations personnel. The market for such personnel is competitive in certain regions for certain types of technical skills.\nA number of our employees are foreign nationals who rely on visas and entry permits in order to legally work in the United States and other countries. In recent years, the United States has increased the level of scrutiny in granting H-1B, L-1 and other business visas. Compliance with U.S. immigration and labor laws could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain skilled professionals. Any of these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial conditions.\nIf we fail to anticipate technological shifts, market needs and opportunities, and develop products, product enhancements and business strategies that meet those technological shifts, needs and opportunities in a timely manner or if they do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.\nThe markets for our products are constantly evolving and characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, changes in customer requirements, evolving industry standards, and continuous pricing pressures.\nWhen we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products, customers may defer or cancel orders for our existing products; in addition, ending sales of existing products may cause customers to cancel or defer orders for our existing products. These actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales, increasing inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future technological shifts, market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products, product enhancements and business strategies to meet such technological shifts, needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all. If we fail to anticipate market requirements or opportunities or fail to develop and introduce new products, product enhancements or business strategies to meet those requirements or opportunities in a timely manner, it could cause us to lose customers, and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we are able to anticipate, develop, and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, we cannot assure that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance.\nIf our products do not effectively inter-operate with our customers\u2019 networks and result in cancellations and delays of installations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur products are designed to interface with our customers\u2019 existing networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors. Many of our customers\u2019 networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products must inter-operate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers\u2019 networks, we may need to modify our software networking solutions to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will inter-operate and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could be costly and could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our products do not inter-operate with those of our customers\u2019 networks, demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be canceled. This could harm our operating results, and financial condition, damage our reputation, and seriously harm our business and prospects.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to stronger competition and may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants.\nThe cloud networking market is rapidly evolving. If this market does not evolve as we anticipate or our target end customers do not adopt our cloud networking solutions, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.\nThe cloud networking market is the fastest growing segment of the networking industry. The market demand for cloud networking solutions has increased in recent years as end customers have deployed larger networks and have increased the use of\nvirtualization and cloud computing. Our success may be impacted by our ability to provide successful cloud networking solutions that address the needs of our channel partners and end customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies. If the cloud networking solutions market does not develop in the way we anticipate, if our solutions do not offer significant benefits compared to competing legacy network switching products, or if end customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide, then our potential for growth in this cloud networking market could be adversely affected. In addition, if the transition to a cloud-based model takes a significant amount of time, we run the risk of affecting our current core revenue streams.\nWhen our products contain undetected errors, we may incur significant unexpected expenses and could lose sales.\nNetwork products frequently contain undetected errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace. In the past, we have experienced such errors in connection with new products and product updates. We have experienced component problems in prior years that caused us to incur higher than expected warranty, service costs and expenses, and other related operating expenses. In the future, we expect that, from time to time, such errors or component failures will be found in new or existing products after the commencement of commercial shipments. These problems may have a material adverse effect on our business by causing us to incur significant warranty, repair and replacement costs, diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from new product development efforts, delaying the recognition of revenue, and causing significant customer relations problems. Further, if products are not accepted by customers due to such defects, and such returns exceed the amount we accrued for defective returns, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur products must successfully inter-operate with products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems. The occurrence of system errors, whether or not caused by our products, could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses. The occurrence of any such problems would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe must continue to develop and increase the productivity of our indirect distribution channels to increase net revenues and improve our operating results.\nOur distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and increasing the productivity of our indirect distribution channels. If we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant channel partners, if we are unable to meet their needs, or if these channel partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer. Many of our channel partners also sell products from other vendors that compete with our products. Our channel partners may not continue to market or sell our products effectively or to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales, marketing, and technical support. We may not be able to successfully manage our sales channels or enter into additional reseller and/or distribution agreements. Our failure to do any of these could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenues.\nOur operating results for any given period have and will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a relatively small number of channel partners and other customers. However, we do not have binding purchase commitments from any of them. A substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to a significant reseller, distributor or other customer could harm our business, operating results and financial condition because our expense levels are based on our expectations as to future revenues and, to a large extent, are fixed in the short term. Under specified conditions, some third-party distributors are allowed to return products to us and unexpected returns could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe sales cycle for our products is long and we may incur substantial non-recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated.\nThe purchase of our products represents a significant strategic decision by a customer regarding its communications infrastructure. The decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on the results of a variety of internal procedures associated with the evaluation, testing, implementation, and acceptance of new technologies. Accordingly, the product evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle, typically ranging from three months to longer than a year, and as a result, our ability to sell products is subject to a number of significant risks, including risks that:\n\u2022\nbudgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews by customers will result in the loss of potential sales;\n\u2022\nthere may be substantial variation in the length of the sales cycle from customer to customer, making decisions on the expenditure of resources difficult to assess;\n\u2022\nwe may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management time in an attempt to initiate or increase the sale of products to customers, but not succeed;\n\u2022\nwhen a sales forecast from a specific customer for a particular quarter is not achieved in that quarter, we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall, which could harm our operating results; and\n\u2022\ndownward pricing pressures could occur during the lengthy sales cycle for our products.\nWe rely on third-party providers for services needed to deliver our cloud solutions and other third-party providers for our internal operations. Any disruption in the services provided by such third-party providers could adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\nOur cloud solutions are hosted from and use computing infrastructure provided by third parties, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. We do not own or control the operation of the third-party facilities or equipment used to provide the cloud services. Our computing infrastructure service providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our computing infrastructure service providers is acquired, we may be required to transition to a new provider and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. In addition, such service providers could decide to close their facilities or change or suspend their service offerings without adequate notice to us. Moreover, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy, faced by such service providers may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict.\nIf these third-party service providers experience service outages, performance problems or errors, this could adversely affect the experience of our customers. Our agreements with third-party computing infrastructure service providers may not entitle us to corresponding service level credits to those we offer to our customers. Any changes in third-party service levels at our computing infrastructure service providers or any related disruptions or performance problems with our solutions could adversely affect our reputation and impact our customers\u2019 operations, result in lengthy interruptions in our services, or result in potential losses of customer data. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenues, cause us to issue refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscriptions, subject us to service level credit claims and potential liability, or adversely affect our renewal rates.\nAdditionally, if a third-party service provider fails to maintain compliance with standards such as SOC2 or ISO27001, it could affect the underlying controls that we maintain, or that our customers rely upon. This could entail additional costs to compensate for the lost controls, or have a negative impact on revenue if our customers do not perceive our vendors as secure.\nWe rely on third-party cloud service providers such as Salesforce and Oracle to support internal operations. Disruptions to such service or data breaches of those services could impact our ability to maintain efficient operations and to provide services to our customers.\nSystem security risks, data breaches, and cyber-attacks could compromise our proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations, impact services to customers, and harm public perception of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide cloud-based services and store data, including intellectual property, and our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners on our networks. In addition, we store information through cloud-based services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties. The secure provision of services and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy.\nIncreasingly, companies, including us, are subject to a variety of attacks on their networks and/or cloud-based services on an ongoing basis. The number and severity of these attacks could increase as a result of nation-state actors initiating attacks for political or cyber warfare purposes. Attacks could include supply chain attacks targeting our suppliers and attempts to penetrate our systems or disrupt our services directly. In some cases, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain vulnerabilities in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could allow network intrusion or unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks. Usage of \u201clegacy\u201d products that have been determined to have reached an end of life engineering status but will continue to operate for a limited amount of time may subject us or our customers to new vulnerabilities. Further, employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions can result in a security or data breach.\nDespite our security measures, we may not be able to effectively detect, prevent, or protect against or otherwise mitigate losses from all cyber-attacks or prevent all security or data breaches. Because the techniques used by computer programmers and hackers, many of whom are highly sophisticated and well-funded, to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used, we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques. Any such breach could compromise our products, networks, or cloud-based services by creating system disruptions, slowdowns or even shutdowns, and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products, and the information stored as part of our operations could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Such events which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, could require significant management attention and resources, could result in the loss of business, regulatory actions and potential liability, and could cause us reputational and financial harm.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our products, network, or in the network of a customer of our networking products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness or security of our products could be harmed. This could impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, the economic costs to us to eliminate, mitigate, or recover from, or remediate cyber or\nother security problems, such as bugs, viruses, worms, ransomware or other malware, and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure.\nThe ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian military forces launched a military action in Ukraine,. Although the length, impact, and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable, this conflict could lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as increases in cyberattacks and espionage.\nRussia\u2019s military actions in Ukraine have led to an unprecedented expansion of sanction programs imposed by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People\u2019s Republic.\nAs the conflict in Ukraine continues to evolve, and the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries may implement additional sanctions, export controls or other measures against Russia, Belarus, and other countries, regions, officials, individuals, or industries in the respective territories. Such sanctions and other measures, as well as the existing and potential further responses from Russia or other countries to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions, could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine and assessing its impact on our business, including our business partners and customers. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. Any of the abovementioned factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nWe cannot assure future profitability, and our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nWe have not been consistently profitable. Even in years when we reported profits, we may not have been profitable in each quarter during those years. We anticipate continuing to incur significant sales and marketing, product development and general and administrative expenses. Any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could result in a loss for a quarter or full year. Even if we are profitable, our operating results may fall below our expectations and those of our investors, which could cause the price of our stock to fall.\nWe may experience challenges or delays in forecasting, generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons and our revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour dependence on obtaining orders during a quarter and shipping those orders in the same quarter to achieve our revenue objectives; in particular, with current supply chain constraints, our backlog has continued to grow as we are unable to ship all orders obtained during a quarter;\n\u2022\norders in our backlog could be cancelled by customers, impacting the accuracy of our revenue forecasting;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the prices of the products we sell;\n\u2022\nthe mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which products are sold;\n\u2022\nacceptance provisions in customer contracts;\n\u2022\nour ability to deliver installation or inspection services by the end of the quarter;\n\u2022\nseasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\na disproportionate percentage of our sales occurring in the last month of a quarter;\n\u2022\nreduced visibility into the implementation cycles for our products and our customers\u2019 spending plans;\n\u2022\nour ability to forecast demand for our products, which in the case of lower-than-expected sales, may result in excess or obsolete inventory in addition to non-cancelable purchase commitments for component parts;\n\u2022\nour sales to the telecommunications service provider market, which represents a significant source of large product orders, being especially volatile and difficult to forecast;\n\u2022\nproduct returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of orders;\n\u2022\nannouncements and new product introductions by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and support relationships with enterprise customers, service providers and other potential large customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole- or limited-source components for our products on a timely basis; and\n\u2022\nchanges in funding for customer technology purchases in our markets.\nIn addition to risks related to revenue, we are subject to risks related to costs, which may be influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve and maintain targeted cost reductions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in warranty or other service expenses actually incurred;\n\u2022\nincreases in the price of the components we purchase;\n\u2022\nincreases in costs associated with sourcing and shipping components and finished products;\n\u2022\ngeneral inflationary pressures, increasing the cost of all inputs; and\n\u2022\nrising interest rates, increasing the cost of borrowing.\nWe are subject to changes in general and specific macro-economic conditions in the networking industry, which could affect both revenue and costs.\nDue to the foregoing and other factors, many of which are described herein, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance.\nWe may not realize anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic investments, and the integration of acquired companies or technologies may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations or dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nAs part of our business strategy, we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, on September 14, 2021, we acquired Ipanematech SAS, the SD-WAN division of InfoVista SAS, for EUR 60 million in cash consideration. In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:\n\u2022\nissue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt;\n\u2022\nassume contingent liabilities; or\n\u2022\nexpend significant cash.\nThese actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results or the price of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance we will achieve the revenues, growth prospects, and synergies expected from any acquisition or that we will achieve such revenues, growth prospects, and synergies in the anticipated time period and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Moreover, even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings, these benefits may be recognized much later than the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred. This is particularly relevant in cases where it would be necessary to integrate new types of technology into our existing portfolio and new types of products may be targeted for potential customers with which we do not have pre-existing relationships.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any current and future acquisitions, divestitures and investment activities also entail numerous risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation and successful integration of acquired operations, sales functions, technologies, and/or products;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs, litigation or other contingent liabilities associated with the acquisition or investment transaction;\n\u2022\nincurrence of acquisition- and integration-related costs, goodwill or in-process research and development impairment charges, or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets, that could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations and inability to attract or retain other key employees; and\n\u2022\nsubstantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets, deferred stock compensation or similar items.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated positive impacts to future financial results from our restructuring efforts.\nWe have undertaken restructuring efforts in the past to streamline operations and reduce operating expenses. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring efforts within expected time frames is subject to many estimates and assumptions and may vary materially based on factors such as market conditions and the effect of our restructuring efforts on our work force. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure that we will fully realize the anticipated positive impacts to future financial results from our current or future restructuring efforts. If our estimates and assumptions are incorrect or if other unforeseen events occur, we may not achieve the cost savings expected from such restructurings, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past and may significantly fluctuate in the future.\nIn the past, the trading price of shares of our common stock has fluctuated significantly. This could continue as we or our competitors announce new products, our results or those of our customers or competition fluctuate, conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry change, conditions in the global economy change, or when investors change their sentiment toward stocks in the networking technology sector.\nIn addition, fluctuations in our stock price and our enterprise value to sales valuation may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stock rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis. These fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. Some companies, including us, that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them. If a suit were filed against us, regardless of its merits or outcome, it could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIntense competition in the market for networking equipment and cloud platform companies could prevent us from increasing revenues and attaining profitability.\nThe market for network switching solutions is intensely competitive and dominated primarily by Cisco Systems Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company, Juniper Networks, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Arista Networks, Inc., and Ubiquiti Inc. Most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, broader product lines and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources. As a result, these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. In addition, they have larger distribution channels, stronger brand names, access to more customers, a larger installed customer base and a greater ability to make attractive offers to channel partners and customers than we do. Further, many of our competitors have made substantial investments in hardware networking capabilities and offerings. These competitors may be able to gain market share by leveraging their investments in hardware networking capabilities to attract customers at lower prices or with greater synergies. Some of our customers may question whether we have the financial resources to complete their projects and future service commitments.\nWe may also face increased competition from both traditional networking solutions companies and cloud platform companies offering IaaS and PaaS products to enterprise customers. In particular, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and the Google Cloud Platform may provide enterprise customers with a cloud-based platform of data center computing and networking services.\nFor example, we have encountered, and expect to continue to encounter in the future, many potential customers who are confident in and committed to the product offerings of our principal competitors. Accordingly, these potential customers may not consider or evaluate our products. When such potential customers have considered or evaluated our products, we have in the past lost, and expect in the future to lose, sales to some of these customers as large competitors have offered significant price discounts to secure these sales.\nThe pricing policies of our competitors impact the overall demand for our products and services. Some of our competitors are capable of operating at significant losses for extended periods of time, increasing pricing pressure on our products and services. If we do not maintain competitive pricing, the demand for our products and services, as well as our market share, may decline. From time to time, we may lower the prices of our products and services in response to competitive pressure. When this happens, if we are unable to reduce our component costs or improve operating efficiencies, our revenues and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nOne of our key differentiators is the quality of our support and services. Our failure to continue to provide high-quality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe intend to invest in engineering, sales, services, marketing and manufacturing on a long-term basis, and delays or inability to attain the expected benefits may result in unfavorable operating results.\nWhile we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, services, marketing and manufacturing functions as we focus on our foundational priorities, such as leadership in our core products and solutions and architectures for business transformation. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur credit facilities impose financial and operating restrictions on us and if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our 2019 Credit Agreement (as defined in Item 7, \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), the lenders under such 2019 Credit Agreement, as amended, could foreclose on, and acquire control of, substantially all of our assets.\nOur 2019 Credit Agreement imposes, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us. These restrictions could affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other items, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nguarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends or other distributions to stockholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase equity interests;\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our business;\n\u2022\nenter into swap agreements;\n\u2022\nissue or sell capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nOur 2019 Credit Agreement also requires us to achieve and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and certain liquidity and revenue metrics. A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios or metrics could result in a default under our 2019 Credit Agreement. The lenders under our 2019 Credit Agreement also have the right in the event of a breach of the restrictive covenants to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.\nFurther, our 2019 Credit Agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries. Borrowings under our 2019 Credit Agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets, including the capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries, and the assets of our subsidiaries that are loan party guarantors. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due or comply with other obligations and covenants under our 2019 Credit Agreement, the lenders under our 2019 Credit Agreement will have the right to proceed against these pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets.\nOur cash requirements may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing and we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur 2019 Credit Agreement may not be sufficient for our future working capital, investments and cash requirements, in which case we would need to seek additional debt or equity financing or scale back our operations. In addition, we may need to seek additional financing to achieve and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios under our 2019 Credit Agreement, as amended. We may not be able to access additional capital resources due to a variety of reasons, including the restrictive covenants in our 2019 Credit Agreement and the lack of available capital due to global economic conditions. If our financing requirements are not met and we are unable to access additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nUncertainty about the future of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) could impact the cost of our borrowing and ability to mitigate interest rate risk.\nCertain of our financing instruments involve variable rate debt, thus exposing us to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. Our 2019 Credit Agreement provides for interest to be calculated based on the LIBOR, however, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, intends to phase out LIBOR completely by June 2023. With the expected discontinuation of LIBOR, the U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), an index based on transactions in the Treasury repurchase market. The scheduled discontinuation of LIBOR in June of 2023 occurs before the maturity of borrowings under our existing credit facility. We expect to amend the terms of the credit facility to include SOFR based borrowing before the final phase out of LIBOR in June of 2023. At this time, we cannot be certain that the amended terms will be as favorable as existing terms. There is risk that market disruptions could impact our ability to amend the agreement, and/or enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate\ninterest rate risk. We may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our channel partners and some of our end customers, which could result in material losses.\nMost of our sales are on an open credit basis, with standard payment terms of 30 days in the United States and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the U.S. We monitor individual end-customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. Any significant delay or default in the collection of significant accounts receivable could potentially result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources, possibly on less favorable terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults. Any significant default could adversely affect our results of operations and delay our ability to recognize revenue.\nA material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors, systems integrators, and value-added resellers. Some of our distributors, systems integrators and value-added resellers may experience financial difficulties, which could adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable. Our exposure to credit risks of our channel partners may increase if our channel partners and their end customers are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions. One or more of these channel partners could delay payments or default on credit extended to them, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRising interest rates and increasing inflation could put additional financial pressures on some partners and customers, which could result in longer collection times or default on payment to us.\nIf we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes, our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process. We need to ensure that any businesses acquired are appropriately integrated in our financial systems. We need to continue improving our existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the integration of acquired businesses, or delay and disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis, or to forecast future results.\nWe are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and publicly disclose any material weaknesses in our controls. Any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and significant expense to remediate, and ultimately could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to disclose if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner. We have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs, implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company will have been detected.\nIf we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and its stock price may decline. Remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and, if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC or Nasdaq. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods. Execution of restatements create a significant strain on our internal resources and could cause delays in our filing of quarterly or annual financial results, increase our costs and cause management distraction. Restatements may also significantly affect our stock price in an adverse manner.\nOur revenues may decline as a result of changes in public funding of educational institutions.\nA portion of our revenues comes from sales to both public and private K-12 educational institutions. Public schools receive funding from local tax revenues, and from state and federal governments through a variety of programs, many of which seek to assist schools located in underprivileged or rural areas. The funding for a portion of our sales to U.S.-based educational institutions comes from a federal funding program known as the E-Rate program. E-Rate is a program of the Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d) that subsidizes the purchase of approved telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connection costs for eligible public\neducational institutions. The E-Rate program, its eligibility criteria, the timing and specific amount of federal funding actually available and which Wi-Fi infrastructure and product sectors will benefit, are uncertain and subject to final federal program approval and funding appropriation continues to be under review by the FCC, and we cannot assure that this program or its equivalent will continue, and as a result, our business may be harmed. Furthermore, if state or local funding of public education is significantly reduced because of legislative or policy changes or by reductions in tax revenues due to changing economic conditions, our sales to educational institutions may be negatively impacted by these changed conditions. Any reduction in spending on information technology systems by educational institutions would likely materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. This is a specific example of the many factors which add additional uncertainty to our future revenues from our end-customers in the education sector.\nRegulatory, Tax and Legal Risks\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to:\n\u2022\ncomply with securities laws and regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncomply with export controls and sanctions laws and regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncomply with anti-corruption laws and regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncomply with internal controls that we have established;\n\u2022\nreport financial information or data accurately; or\n\u2022\ndisclose unauthorized activities to us.\nThe precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nOur operating results may be negatively affected by legal proceedings.\nWe have in the past, currently are and will likely in the future pursue or be subject to claims or lawsuits in the normal course of our business. In addition to the risks related to the intellectual property lawsuits described above, we are currently parties to other litigation as described in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. Regardless of the result, litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a lawsuit in which we are a defendant could result in a court order against us or payments to other parties that would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Even if we are successful in prosecuting claims and lawsuits, we may not recover damages sufficient to cover our expenses incurred to manage, investigate and pursue the litigation. In addition, subject to certain limitations, we may be obligated to indemnify our current and former customers, suppliers, directors, officers and employees in certain lawsuits. We may not have adequate insurance coverage to cover all of our litigation costs and liabilities.\nClaims of infringement by others may increase and the resolution of such claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patents, copyrights (including rights to \u201copen source\u201d software) and other intellectual property rights. As we have grown, we have, and may continue to, experience greater revenues and increased public visibility, which may cause competitors, customers, and governmental authorities to be more likely to initiate litigation against us. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents and the issuance of new patents at a rapid pace, it is not possible to determine in advance if a product or component might infringe the patent rights of others. Because of the potential for courts awarding substantial damages, or internationally prohibiting us from exporting, in the case of China, or importing our products, in the case of Germany, the lack of predictability of such awards and the high legal costs associated with the defense of such patent infringement matters that would be expended to prove lack of infringement, it is not uncommon for companies in our industry to settle even potentially unmeritorious claims for very substantial amounts. Furthermore, the entities with whom we have or could have disputes or discussions include entities with extensive patent portfolios and substantial financial assets. These entities are actively engaged in programs to generate substantial revenues from their patent portfolios and are seeking or may seek significant payments or royalties from us and others in our industry.\nLitigation resulting from claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others has resulted and could in the future result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We previously received notices from entities alleging that we were infringing their patents and have been party to patent litigation in the past.\nWithout regard to the merits of these or any other claims, an adverse court order or a settlement could require us, among other actions, to:\n\u2022\nstop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain a royalty bearing license to sell or use the relevant technology, and that license may not be available on reasonable terms or available at all;\n\u2022\npay damages;\n\u2022\nredesign those products that use the disputed technology; or\n\u2022\nface a ban on importation or exportation of our products into the United States or into another country.\nIn addition, our products include so-called \u201copen source\u201d software. Open source software is typically licensed for use at no initial charge but imposes on the user of the open source software certain requirements to license to others both the open source software as well as modifications to the open source software under certain circumstances. Our use of open source software subjects us to certain additional risks for the following reasons:\n\u2022\nopen source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding the licensing of our products and intellectual property;\n\u2022\nopen source software cannot be protected under trade secret law;\n\u2022\nsuppliers of open-source software do not provide the warranty, support and liability protections typically provided by vendors who offer proprietary software; and\n\u2022\nit may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the acquired software infringes third-party intellectual property rights.\nWe believe even if we do not infringe the rights of others, we will incur significant expenses in the future due to defense of legal claims, disputes or licensing negotiations, though the amounts cannot be determined. These expenses may be material or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party licenses.\nSome of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property, including open source software, licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products. Further, the failure to comply with the terms of any license, including free open source software, may result in our inability to continue to use such license.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could affect our business.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. However, we cannot ensure that the actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights or that other parties will not independently develop similar or competing products that do not infringe on our patents. We generally enter into confidentiality, invention assignment or license agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties with whom we do business, and control access to and distribution of our intellectual property and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise misappropriate or use our products or technology, which would adversely affect our business.\nFailure of our products to comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations may adversely impact our business.\nIf we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards and government regulations, we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply. The network equipment industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customers' requirements and evolving industry standards. As a result, our success depends on:\n\u2022\nthe timely adoption and market acceptance of industry standards, and timely resolution of conflicting U.S. and international industry standards; and\n\u2022\nour ability to influence the development of emerging industry standards and to introduce new and enhanced products that are compatible with such standards.\nIn the past, we have introduced new products that were not compatible with certain technological standards, and in the future, we may not be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards.\nOur products must also comply with various U.S. federal government regulations and standards defined by agencies such as the FCC, standards established by governmental authorities in various foreign countries and recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union. In some circumstances, we must obtain regulatory approvals or certificates of compliance before we can offer or distribute our products in certain jurisdictions or to certain customers. Complying with new regulations or obtaining certifications can be costly and disruptive to our business.\nIf we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or government regulations, we will not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply, which may prevent us from sustaining our net revenues or achieving profitability.\nOur provision for income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors, including reorganizations or restructurings of our business, jurisdictional revenue mix and changes in tax regulations or policy, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a multinational company subject to income tax as well as non-income-based taxes in various jurisdictions including Ireland, where we have an operating company supporting our business in most non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates, expiration of or lapses in the research and development tax credit laws, transfer pricing adjustments in the various jurisdictions we do business, tax effects of nondeductible compensation, including stock-based compensation, changes in accounting principles and imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Additionally, our calculations of income taxes payable, currently and on a deferred basis, are based on our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we are required to file tax returns. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Changes in tax laws and regulations and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, including taxation of earnings internationally, the introduction of base erosion and anti-abuse tax and the disallowance of tax deductions for certain expenses, as well as changes that may be enacted in the future could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), an international association comprised of 38 countries including the United States and Ireland, has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized and adopted by associated countries, will not have a materially adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. Recently, substantially all member countries of the OECD agreed to certain tax principles, including a global minimum tax of 15%. Many countries are also actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business, including the introduction of taxes targeted at digital services.\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years pursuant to IRC Section 174 depending on whether the expenditure is recorded in the U.S. or a foreign jurisdiction. Although the U.S. Congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement to later years, we have no assurance the provision will be repealed or modified. If the requirement is not repealed or modified, our existing U.S. net operating losses will be utilized on an accelerated basis, and we could potentially be subject to U.S. cash tax sooner than anticipated. In addition, our effective tax rate will materially increase as we made an accounting policy election to treat Global Intangible Low Tax Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) as a period cost (i.e., recorded when incurred) in 2018 when the GILTI rules were introduced. Our research and development expenditures are shared by our U.S. parent and Irish principal company and as such, the disallowed deduction will drive up our GILTI inclusion associated with Ireland, which in turn will increase our effective tax rate.\nA change in our future effective tax rate, including from the release of the valuation allowances recorded against our net U.S. and Irish deferred tax assets may create volatility in our calculated tax expense. Our future effective tax rate in particular could be adversely affected by a change in ownership pursuant to Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. If a change in ownership occurs, it may limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset our U.S. taxable income and therefore create a material adverse impact on our results of operations. On April 26, 2012, we adopted the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement between the Company and Computershare Shareholder Services LLC as the rights agent (the \u201cRestated Rights Plan\u201d), which was extended annually through 2021, to help protect our assets. On May 17, 2021, we adopted an Amended and Restated Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (the \u201c2021 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan\u201d), which was approved by stockholders on November 4, 2021. In general, this does not\nallow a stockholder to acquire more than 4.95% of our outstanding common stock without a waiver from our Board, who must take into account the relevant tax analysis relating to potential limitation of our net operating losses. Our 2021 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan is effective through May 17, 2024, unless earlier terminated by the Board.\nFinally, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, Irish Revenue, and other tax authorities globally. Although we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there is no assurance our assessments are, in fact, adequate. Changes in our effective tax rates or amounts assessed upon examination of our tax returns may have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent an acquisition of Extreme, which could decrease the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. In addition, our Board has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer. Although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders.\nOur bylaws, as amended, provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders to us, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for any cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, other employees and stockholders. Furthermore, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive-forum provisions, and there can be no assurance that such provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur 2021 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan provides that if a single stockholder (or group) acquires more than 4.95% of our outstanding common stock without a waiver from our Board, each holder of one share of our common stock (other than the stockholder or group who acquired in excess of 4.95% of our common stock) may purchase a fractional share of our preferred stock that would result in substantial dilution to the triggering stockholder or group. Accordingly, although this plan is designed to prevent any limitation on the utilization of our net operating losses by avoiding issues raised under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the 2021 Tax Benefit Preservation Plan could also serve as a deterrent to stockholders wishing to effect a change of control.\nCompliance with laws, rules and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nFederal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as Nasdaq rules and regulations, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their Chief Executive Officers, Chief Financial Officers and directors for securities law violations. These laws, rules and regulations and the interpretation of these requirements are evolving, and we are making investments to evaluate current practices and to continue to achieve compliance, which investments may have a material impact on our financial condition.\nGeneral\nNatural or man-made disasters, acts of war or terrorism, pandemics, technological disruptions or other events beyond our control could disrupt our operations and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have major offices in Morrisville, North Carolina, San Jose, California, and Salem, New Hampshire in the United States, as well as in Bangalore, India, in Thornhill, Canada, in Shannon, Ireland and in Reading, United Kingdom. Historically, each location\nhas been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, fires, floods and tropical storms, which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property. We have contract manufacturers located in China, Taiwan, and Mexico where similar natural disasters and other risks may disrupt the local economy and pose physical risks to our property and the property of our contract manufacturer. Global shipping could be disrupted by natural disasters, which would impede our ability to get product to our customers. Climate change may exacerbate the frequency or severity of such natural disasters.\nIn addition, the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries. If such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results will suffer.\nCivil unrest, riots, pandemics and other systemic disruptions could disrupt demand for products, supply chain, or distribution and could negatively impact our costs or revenue. Such disruptions to the availability or integrity of utilities, transportation infrastructure, or the internet could have significant macroeconomic impacts, decreasing demand for our products and impacting our ability to get them to market. As a result, our financial situation and operating results would be negatively affected.\nSee also, \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak has had, and continues to have, a materially disruptive effect on our business.\u201d", "PERMNO": 86822, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "EXTR"}
