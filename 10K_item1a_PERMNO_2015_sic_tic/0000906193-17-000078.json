{"cik": "906193", "company": "KEY TECHNOLOGY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-12-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS.\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant effect on our operating results and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below and the information presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, actual results could differ materially from those included in any forward-looking statements.\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and our operating results.\nOur sales may be adversely affected by uncertainties and general economic conditions that may cause customers to defer or cancel new orders and sales commitments previously made. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, our revenue and ability to generate operating profits would be materially adversely affected and subject our business to the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\nimpair the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers, thereby increasing customer bad debts or non- performance by suppliers;\n\u2022\nadversely affect our ability to fund new product development necessary to meet future customer requirements;\n\u2022\nnegatively affect global demand for our customers' products, particularly in the food industry, which could result in a reduction of sales, underutilization of our production facilities, and a reduction in operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022\nadversely affect our expansion plans, including possible acquisitions;\n\u2022\nnegatively affect our customers' ability to obtain financing, which could result in a reduction in sales, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022\nnegatively affect our return on cash and cash equivalents;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments;\n\u2022\nnegatively affect the results of our risk management activities if we are required to record losses related to financial instruments or experience counterparty failure;\n\u2022\nresult in charges for excess or obsolete inventory or require other asset write-downs; and\n\u2022\nthe volatility of the trading price of our common stock may increase.\nPolitical, economic, and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nRecent political and economic developments, including the Brexit vote in the U.K., the presidential election in the U.S., central bank monetary policies, low growth in various international markets, rising global debt, renegotiation of trade agreements, and the threat of deflation, may affect global economic conditions and, in turn, our sales. In 2017, approximately 60% of our revenue was derived from customers located outside of the United States. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. We intend to continue to expand our sales and operations outside of the United States. As a result, our business is subject to the risks inherent in international sales and operations, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nvarious regulatory and statutory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in injecting and repatriating cash;\n\u2022\nexport and import restrictions;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays;\n\u2022\nnew tariffs and customs duties;\n\u2022\nemployment regulations and local labor conditions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales operations;\n\u2022\ninstability in economic or political conditions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022\nbusiness systems connectivity issues; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nVariable economic conditions in the food processing industry, either globally or regionally, may adversely affect our sales.\nThe markets we serve, particularly in the food processing industry, are generally experiencing variable economic conditions. Additionally, varying consumer demand due to economic conditions, or dietary trends, product supply, and excess plant capacity, most notably in the potato market, could result in reduced or deferred capital equipment purchases for our product lines. A significant portion of our food processing customer base operates on relatively low margins and consequently can be quickly affected by adverse economic conditions, resulting in a decline in purchases from us. Loss of business, particularly in the potato industry, would have a negative effect on our net sales and net earnings.\nSignificant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business.\nProduct development in our industry is a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment. If we fail to predict and meet future customer needs and preferences, fail to incorporate industry-leading technologies in our products, or fail to allocate our research and development funding to products with higher customer acceptance and growth prospects, we may find we have invested in the development of products that do not lead to significant revenue for a number of years, if at all. Failure to successfully develop new products may also cause existing or potential customers to choose competitors' products. Even if we successfully develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may be reduced. Moreover, new products may not generate the gross margins that we anticipate.\nOur existing and new products may not compete successfully in either current or new markets, which could result in the loss of market share and a decrease in our sales and profits.\nOur future success and growth is dependent upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market, and sell products and services in certain food processing markets as well as to introduce new products into other existing and potential markets. There is no assurance that we will be able to introduce new products, or platforms such as VERYX, in accordance with our anticipated release dates or that new products will achieve market acceptance. The ultimate commercial success of a product depends upon various factors, many of which are not under our control. Customers have become increasingly concerned about their return on investment, energy conservation, sanitation and food safety, and our market solutions need to be cognizant of these considerations. There can be no assurance that we can successfully and profitably penetrate these potential markets or expand into new international markets with our current or future products. In addition, new product introductions and enhancements of existing products may reduce demand for our existing products or delay purchases by customers awaiting arrival of our new products. As new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from existing products. Difficulties that arise in managing the transition from our older products to our new or enhanced products could result in additional costs and deferred or lost revenue. There are also inherent risks in developing new technologies, entering new markets, and expanding in our existing markets including:\n\u2022\nlength of time and cost for development of these technologies and markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to bring new solutions to the market in a timely manner and maintain a competitive advantage;\n\u2022\nour ability to transition our production processes to meet increased demand for new products;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of the technological capability to address the requirements and performance specifications of new and existing markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain new technology from third parties when we cannot cost-effectively develop these technologies ourselves;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture our products in various geographies may affect our success in certain new markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to design products for ease of manufacturability and service;\n\u2022\nincreased dependence on sole source providers of integral components for new products;\n\u2022\nour ability to design and manufacture products for configurability, modularity and cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture and sell our new products at sustainable gross margins;\n\u2022\nour ability to train and develop personnel on new production, sales and service methods;\n\u2022\nproduct reliability issues related to both new technology and adaptation of existing products to operate in new or rugged operating environments at customer sites;\n\u2022\nreliability, quality or operability problems with high capacity products or products with new technology;\n\u2022\ndesign or manufacturing flaws that may lead to increased product liability or warranty claims, excess or obsolete inventory and resulting charges; and\n\u2022\nfailure to meet performance specifications, which could damage our profitability and the reputation of our products.\nThe loss of any of our significant customers could reduce our sales and profitability.\nWe have significant, strategic customers and we anticipate that our operating results may continue to depend on these customers for the foreseeable future. The loss of any one of those customers, or a significant decrease in the volume of products they purchase from us, could adversely affect our sales and materially adversely affect our profitability. Any difficulty in collecting outstanding amounts due from one of those customers may also harm our operating results. In addition, sales to any particular large customer may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, causing fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.\nCompetition may result in lower sales and prices for our products and services.\nWe face aggressive pricing by our competitors, particularly in periods of excess manufacturing capacity. Consolidation among our primary competitors may provide these competitors with greater resources than we have and allow these competitors to compete more effectively on price. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future and our investments in research and development, sales and marketing may be insufficient to enable us to maintain our competitive advantage. Competitive pressure has in the past and may in the future lead to price erosion that could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and operating results.\nConsolidation by our competitors could increase competition in the food processing equipment industry, and consolidation by our food processing industry customers could increase their purchasing power, both of which could reduce our sales and profitability.\nThe food processing equipment industry has experienced recent consolidation. Consolidation by our competitors may enhance their production capacity, technological abilities, broaden their product lines and resources, and lower their cost structure and prices, causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage. Consolidation by our customers could adversely affect capital spending levels which could reduce the volume of products they purchase from us. In addition, certain large customers may exert purchasing power over their vendors and insist on discount pricing or require a higher level of post-sale support, which may lower our gross margin percentage. Our ability to respond to any of these changing market conditions could result in significant price erosion, reduced revenue, lower margins, and loss of market share, any of which could adversely affect our net earnings.\nCustomer sourcing initiatives and purchasing power may adversely affect our new equipment and aftermarket sales, and could result in reduced gross margins.\nMany large companies, including our customers and prospective customers, have undertaken supply chain integration focused primarily on cost savings. In addition, because of their purchasing power, our larger customers can influence suppliers to compete on price terms. If we are not able to offset resulting price reductions by improving operating efficiencies and reducing expenses, such price reductions may have an adverse effect on our profit margins and net earnings.\nOur sales and profits may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing, size and composition of major orders.\nThe length of our sales cycle and the timing of our significant orders depend on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control, including the size and complexity of a potential order, the level of competition that we encounter in our sales activities, and our current and potential customers' internal budgeting and approval process. In addition, the industries we serve, particularly the potato market, have buying patterns that vary greatly between fiscal years. As a result, we may expend significant effort and resources over a long period of time in an attempt to obtain an order, but ultimately not obtain the order, or the order ultimately received may be smaller than anticipated. In addition, if the timing of these orders is delayed from one quarter to the next or from one year to the next, we may also experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual sales and operating results. Our orders from different customers vary from quarter to quarter, and a customer with a large order in one quarter may generate significantly lower orders in subsequent quarters. In addition to timing, the composition and product mix of orders received may result in lower margins than anticipated and may therefore adversely affect our gross margins in subsequent quarters. Due to the resulting fluctuations, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance. These fluctuations in orders will also result in fluctuations in our annual operating results. Additionally, operating margins may be adversely affected by a reduction in sales or changes in product mix, and we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to adjust for the difference between actual and forecasted sales.\nOur operating results are seasonal and may further fluctuate due to severe weather conditions affecting the agricultural industry in various parts of the world.\nA large portion of our customer base processes agricultural products and its demand for our products and solutions fluctuates seasonally. These fluctuations can be independent of the effects of changes in general economic conditions. Consequently, we generally experience lower sales and net income in our first two fiscal quarters. As a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year may not necessarily provide meaningful comparisons.\nIn addition, in the event of severe weather conditions, climate change, geological events or other natural disasters that negatively affect the production of growers, such as prolonged droughts, serious floods or earthquakes, and crop diseases, the food processing industry may not invest in a particular year or years in new equipment in the affected locations. As a result, our sales, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThe failure of our independent sales representatives to perform as expected would harm our net sales.\nSales by independent sales representatives generally account for between 20% and 30% of our consolidated net sales. If our independent sales representatives fail to market, promote and sell our products, our business will be adversely affected. Our independent sales representatives could reduce or discontinue sales of our products, sell competitors' product lines, or may not devote adequate resources to selling our products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect, any of which could adversely affect our sales and net earnings. In addition, our reliance on independent sales representatives may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing issues.\nOur international operations subject us to a number of risks that could adversely affect our sales, operating results and growth.\nWe conduct business outside the United States, which subjects us to the risks inherent in international operations. In fiscal 2017, our international sales represented approximately 60% of our consolidated net sales, compared to approximately 53% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016. Risks inherent in international operations include the following:\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory and certification requirements;\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas, customs duties and tariffs, or trade barriers erected by either the United States or other countries where we do business);\n\u2022\nsanctions imposed by the United States which may affect our ability to do business in foreign countries but may not necessarily affect our competitors;\n\u2022\ncurrency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nscrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes;\n\u2022\nchanges in import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays due to port shutdowns, capacity overloads, varying customs requirements and other factors beyond our control;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022\nchallenges in implementing cost effective operating and manufacturing strategies in varied geographic regions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in implementing effective internal financial and operating controls;\n\u2022\nchallenges in meeting customer requirements in different operating environments;\n\u2022\nchallenges in meeting customer needs in different regions due to regional differences in products and processes;\n\u2022\ninability to globalize solutions for our global customers;\n\u2022\neconomic downturns, civil disturbances or political instability;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical turmoil, including terrorism or war;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing geographically disparate operations;\n\u2022\nmore stringent employment regulations and local labor conditions;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability under local law to protect our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nchanges in domestic and foreign tax rates and laws; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining sales representatives and servicing products in foreign countries, which may adversely affect sales in those countries.\nThe occurrence of any of the above risks could adversely affect our sales, operating results, reputation and growth prospects.\nWe have made, or may make, acquisitions or enter into distribution agreements or similar business relationships that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe have made, or may in the future make, acquisitions of businesses, or enter into distribution agreements or similar business relationships that offer products, services, or technologies that we believe would complement our business. These changes in our business present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that we will manage these changes successfully. These changes in our business involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nsignificant potential expenditures of cash, stock, and management resources;\n\u2022\ndifficulty achieving the potential financial and strategic benefits of the acquisition or business relationship;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating acquired operations or products, including the potential loss of key employees from the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties of integrating different technologies into products and markets;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from our core business, including loss of management's focus on marketplace development;\n\u2022\nassumption of product liabilities, including warranty costs, for third-party products;\n\u2022\nincreased costs due to required minimum purchase levels and commitments for payments to third parties;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with evaluating and integrating the information systems and internal control systems of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nreduction in our future operating results from amortization of intangible assets and possible future impairment of assets related to goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, including the potential loss of suppliers and customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities, known and unknown, related to the acquired business in general, and litigation and other legal process involving the acquired business in particular, including intellectual property litigation risk;\n\u2022\nentering geographic areas or distribution channels in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\n\u2022\nthose risks related to general economic and political conditions.\nThere can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to us, that we will be able to obtain financing for or otherwise consummate any acquisition, or that any acquisition that we do consummate will be successful.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in unanticipated losses that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because a portion of our sales, expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in the value of foreign currencies affect our results of operations and financial position. With respect to international sales denominated in U.S. dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would make our products less price competitive. We attempt to manage certain effects of foreign currency fluctuations by entering into short-term forward exchange contracts in situations where it is both possible and practical. These contracts are designed to minimize specific foreign currency gains or losses, as the gains or losses on the derivative are intended to offset the losses or gains on the underlying exposure. However, these contracts do not cover our full exposure and, additionally, there is no guarantee that these forward contracts will protect against the foreign exchange fluctuations in the underlying exposure. Accordingly, we could experience foreign currency gains or losses that could have a material effect on our operating results.\nAdvances in technology by competitors may adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nThe rapidly changing needs of the markets for our products demand constant innovation. Competitors may be able to adapt or develop technologies to create or enhance product offerings that directly compete with our products. Advances in technology may also remove some barriers to market entry, enabling additional competitors to enter our markets. These innovations could cause our products to become less competitive or obsolete, leading to a decrease in our sales and profits, or potentially causing us to take an impairment charge, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to develop new products to compete effectively in the future.\nOur expansion into new markets, increasingly complex projects and applications, and integrated product offerings could increase our cost of operations and reduce gross margins and profitability.\nOur growth strategy includes expansion into new product and geographic markets, complex projects and applications, and integrated product offerings to provide turnkey solutions to customers. As a result, we may encounter new types of competition and be required to develop new sales channels. Successful development of new markets and market adjacencies requires us to understand the unique requirements and differentiated customer needs of these markets, and to develop our infrastructure to respond to these demands. Development of such markets and turnkey solutions is likely to require sustained investment, increase our cost of sales, reduce our gross margins to the extent products purchased from others are integrated into our product offerings, reduce margins due to competition or market conditions, and result in overall reduced profitability. We are also likely to encounter technical challenges and increased costs related to the integration of products from multiple vendors, acquisition and integration of intellectual property from multiple vendors, adaptation and installation of products in larger and more complex plants, ensuring product performance in more difficult operating environments, and meeting unfamiliar customer requirements and performance specifications. Such expansion into new markets and increased project complexity could increase demands on our operations and resources, which may affect our ability to timely supply our customers with the services and solutions they have requested. Despite rigorous testing and quality processes, newly developed or enhanced products or solutions may encounter challenges during or after their initial introduction or installation. We may also encounter increased warranty costs, performance issues and liability risks from products we sell but do not manufacture.\nThe failure of our suppliers to deliver quality products in a timely manner or our inability to obtain components for our products could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn certain instances, we depend on original equipment manufacturers and other suppliers of components, including intellectual property, included in our products for the timely delivery of our integrated turnkey products. As we develop new products and solutions, we may become more dependent on original equipment manufacturers in the future. Such suppliers may experience problems beyond our control, which may disrupt our ability to deliver our products to our customers and damage our relationships with current and future customers. These risks may include varying lead times, supplier capacity, delayed shipments, and quality control problems. In addition, supplier pricing may change and be higher than anticipated. As a result of these and other factors, our sales and profit margins may be adversely affected.\nOur dependence on certain suppliers may leave us temporarily without adequate access to raw materials, intellectual property or products.\nWe rely on third-party domestic and foreign suppliers for certain raw materials. Several of these suppliers are the single source of the raw material or supply products that are the intellectual property of the supplier. As we develop new and more technologically advanced products, our reliance on single source providers or their intellectual property may increase. We do not have long-term contracts with any supplier. In addition, as we develop new products and technological solutions, we may become more dependent on sole source providers. We may be adversely affected in the event that these suppliers cease operations, cease doing business with us or if pricing terms become less favorable. The loss of a key vendor may force us to purchase our necessary raw materials and components in the open market, which may not be possible or may be at higher prices, until we could secure another source. There is no assurance that the terms of any subsequent supply arrangements we may enter into would be as favorable as the supply arrangements we currently have in place. If we are unable to replace a key supplier, we may face delays in delivering finished products, which could have an adverse effect on our sales, financial performance and reputation.\nThe limited availability and possible cost fluctuations of materials used in our products could adversely affect our gross margins.\nCertain basic materials, such as stainless steel, are used extensively in our product fabrication processes. Such basic materials have, in the past, been subject to worldwide shortages or price fluctuations related to the supply of, or demand for, raw materials, such as nickel, which are used in their production by our suppliers. A significant increase in the price or decrease in the availability of one or more of these components, subassemblies or basic materials could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur products may suffer from defects leading to warranty claims.\nWe include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. If any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign those products or pay substantial warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses, including expenses arising from re-engineering and warranty claims, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation security breaches or business system disruptions may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our information technology infrastructure and management information systems to effectively run our business. We may be subject to information security breaches caused by illegal hacking, computer viruses, or acts of vandalism or terrorism. Our security measures may not detect or prevent such breaches, or we may not have devoted sufficient resources to addressing information security risks. Any compromise to our information security could result in a misappropriation of our cash or other assets; an interruption in our operations; the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information; the unauthorized release of customer, vendor, or employee data; the violation of privacy or other laws; and the exposure to litigation, any of which could harm our business and operating results. Any disruption occurring with our management information systems may cause significant business disruption, including our ability to provide quotes, process orders, ship products, invoice customers, process payments, and otherwise run our business. Our failure to comply with United States or foreign laws on data protection or privacy could also adversely affect our business. Any disruption occurring with these systems may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur potential inability to attract and retain experienced management and other key personnel, or the loss of key management personnel, may adversely affect our business and prospects for growth.\nOur success depends in part on the skills and experience of our executives and key employees. The loss of services of such employees could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. In addition, our corporate headquarters is located in Walla Walla, Washington and we have facilities in Beusichem, The Netherlands and Hasselt, Belgium, which are small, relatively remote geographic locations. As such, there may be a limited number of individuals locally with the requisite skill and experience, and we have from time-to-time experienced difficulty recruiting individuals from larger metropolitan areas. The seasonal and cyclical nature of our business may also adversely affect our ability to attract suitable replacements. Additionally, our operations require that we have a number of sales and service personnel working remotely from wide geographic regions, which may create logistical and recruitment challenges.\nConsequently, we may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals on acceptable terms to maintain our business or achieve operational targets. Our success also depends, to a significant degree, upon the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. A limited number of individuals have primary responsibility for managing our business, including our relationships with key customers. These individuals are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products. The loss of the services of members of the management team and other key employees for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur potential inability to protect our intellectual property, especially as we expand geographically, may adversely affect our competitive advantage.\nOur competitive position may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We have obtained certain patents and have filed a number of patent applications. We also anticipate filing patent applications for protection of our future products and technology. There can be no assurance that any such patents will provide meaningful protection for our product innovations, or that the issuance of a patent will give us any material advantage over our competition in connection with any of our products. We may experience additional intellectual property risks in international markets where we may lack patent protection or experience challenges to our intellectual property. The patent laws of other countries differ from those of the U.S. as to the patentability of our products and processes. Moreover, the degree of protection afforded by foreign patents may be different from that of U.S. patents.\nIntellectual property-related litigation expenses and other costs resulting from infringement claims asserted against us by third parties may adversely affect our results of operations and our customer relations.\nThe technologies used by us may infringe the patents or proprietary technology of others. There is also a trend toward aggressive, strategic enforcement of intellectual property rights. As a result, there is a risk that we would be subject to infringement claims which, regardless of validity, could:\n\u2022\nbe expensive, time consuming and divert management attention away from normal business operations;\n\u2022\nrequire us to pay monetary damages or enter into non-standard royalty and licensing agreements;\n\u2022\nrequire us to modify our product sales and development plans; or\n\u2022\nrequire us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers.\nRegardless of whether these claims have any merit, they can be burdensome to defend or settle and can harm our business and reputation.\nOur financing agreements contain restrictive and financial covenants that may adversely affect us.\nCertain of our financing agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests if certain conditions are met. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these agreements. In the event of default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under the loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable and we would lose the ability to provide customers standby letters of credit and lose our ability to utilize short-term credit facilities. As a result, the failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United States and other countries where we do business are pursuing legislation to significantly reform their corporate tax systems. While we are unable to predict which, if any, of these proposed tax reforms will be enacted into law, and what effects any enacted legislation will have on our liability for corporate tax in the United States or other countries, these potential changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. One of the key provisions of these proposals being discussed is the reduction in corporate income tax rates. If enacted, a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate in the United States and other countries could result in a significant reduction in our existing $4.5 million of net deferred tax assets recorded as of September 30, 2017, and consequently a charge to our net earnings, in the period in which any rate change is enacted. It is uncertain whether or when any such US or foreign tax reform proposals will be enacted and the cumulative effect of any such tax reforms on our business and financial results is also uncertain.", "PERMNO": 79399, "SIC": 3550, "TIC": "KTEC"}
