{"cik": "931015", "company": "Polaris Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or operating results, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nOur business may be sensitive to economic conditions, including those that impact consumer spending.\nOur results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions, primarily in North America and Europe, that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Weakening of, and fluctuations in, economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing\nmarket conditions, capital markets, tax rates, savings rates, interest rates, fuel and energy costs, the impacts of natural disasters or other severe weather conditions and acts of terrorism and other matters, including the availability of consumer credit, could reduce overall consumer spending or reduce consumer spending on powersports and aftermarket products. A general reduction in consumer spending or a reduction in consumer spending on powersports, boats and aftermarket products could adversely affect our sales growth and profitability. Overall demand for products sold in the Jeep and truck aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the United States, the total number of registered vehicles in the United States, the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the United States. Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, we have financial services partnership arrangements with subsidiaries of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and TCF Financial Corporation that require us to repurchase products financed and repossessed by the partnership, subject to certain limitations. If adverse changes to economic conditions result in increased defaults on the loans made by this financial services partnership, our repurchase obligation under the partnership arrangement could adversely affect our liquidity and harm our business.\nA significant adverse determination in any material litigation claim against us could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nThe manufacture, sale and usage of our products expose us to significant risks associated with product liability claims. If our products are found to be defective or used incorrectly by our customers, bodily injury, property damage or other injury, including death, may result and this could give rise to additional product liability or economic loss claims against us or adversely affect our brand image or reputation. Any losses that we may suffer from any such claims, and the effect that any such liability may have upon the reputation and marketability of our products, may have a negative impact on our business and operating results.\nBecause of the high cost of product liability insurance premiums and the historically insignificant amount of product liability claims paid by us, we were self-insured from 1985 to 1996 and from 2002 to 2012. From 1996 to 2002, and beginning again in 2012, we purchased excess insurance coverage for product liability claims for incidents occurring subsequent to the policy date that exceeded our self-insured retention levels. The estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to expense when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had an accrual of $57.0 million for the probable payment of pending and expected claims related to product liability matters associated with our products. We believe such accrual is adequate. No assurance can be given that our historical claims record, which has not resulted in any material adverse effects on our financial statements, will not change or that material product liability claims against us will not be made in the future. An unanticipated adverse determination of a material product liability claim made against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nSignificant product repair and/or replacement costs due to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe provide limited warranties for our vehicles and boats. We may also provide longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and customary practice and may also provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs. We also provide a limited emission warranty for certain emission-related parts in our ORVs, snowmobiles, and motorcycles as required by the EPA and CARB. Although we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that needs repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us, through our dealer network, to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods.\nHistorically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors. The repair and replacement costs we could incur in connection with a recall could adversely affect our business. For example, in 2019 we voluntarily initiated product campaigns, including service bulletins, safety-related recalls, and emissions actions. In addition, product recalls could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers, particularly if recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products.\nAny disruption in our suppliers\u2019 operations could disrupt our production schedule.\nOur operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. Our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules. In some instances, we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers\u2019 operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us, which could, in turn, disrupt our operations. If we experience material supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly or at all. Any material disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components, raw materials or parts could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely, which could cause a loss of revenues, which would adversely affect our operations.\nIncreases in the cost of raw material, commodity and transportation costs and shortages of certain raw materials could negatively impact our business.\nThe primary commodities used in manufacturing our products are aluminum, steel, petroleum-based resins and certain rare earth metals used in our charging systems, as well as diesel fuel to transport the products. Our profitability is affected by significant fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials and commodities we use in our products. Additionally, there continues to be significant uncertainty in the current political landscape with respect to future trade regulations and existing international trade agreements. The U.S. has maintained tariffs on certain foreign goods, including raw materials, commodities, and products manufactured outside the United States that are used in our manufacturing processes, which has increased our cost of sales. In response, certain foreign governments have and continue to impose tariffs on certain U.S. goods, and are considering imposing additional tariffs on other U.S. goods, including goods that we sell internationally. The tariffs imposed to date and the possibility of additional retaliatory trade actions stemming from these tariffs could continue to increase our cost of sales, both directly and as a result of price increases implemented by domestic suppliers, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. The impact from these tariffs could require us to shift our manufacturing footprint or result in decreased demand for our products or restructuring actions that could impact our work force and/or our investments in research and development or other growth initiatives. All of these could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and net earnings.\nThe changing relationships of the United States dollar to the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, the Euro, the Swiss franc, the Mexican peso, and certain other foreign currencies have from time to time had a negative impact on our results of operations. Fluctuations in the value of the United States dollar relative to these foreign currencies can adversely affect the price of our products in foreign markets, the costs we incur to import certain components for our products, and the translation of our foreign balance sheets. While we actively manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates by entering into foreign exchange hedging contracts from time to time, these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, and any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transactions being hedged.\nWe face intense competition in all product lines, including from some competitors that have greater financial and marketing resources. Failure to compete effectively against competitors could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nThe markets we operate in are highly competitive. Competition in such markets is based upon a number of factors, including price, quality, reliability, styling, product features and warranties. At the dealer level, competition is based on a number of factors, including sales and marketing support programs (such as financing and cooperative advertising). Certain of our competitors are more diversified, have advantaged manufacturing footprints, and have financial and marketing resources that are substantially greater than ours, which allow these competitors to invest more heavily in intellectual property, product development, promotions and advertising. If we are not able to compete with new or enhanced products or models of our competitors, our future business performance may be materially and adversely affected. Internationally, our products typically face more competition where certain foreign competitors manufacture and market products in their respective countries. This allows those competitors to sell products at lower prices, which could adversely affect our competitiveness. In addition, our products compete with many other recreational products for the discretionary spending of consumers and, to a lesser extent, with other vehicles designed for utility applications. A failure to effectively compete with these other competitors could have a material adverse effect on our performance.\nWe manufacture our products at, and distribute our products from, several locations in North America and internationally. Any disruption at any of these facilities or manufacturing delays could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world. Our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets. No single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. We also have several locations that serve as wholegoods and PG&A distribution centers, warehouses and office facilities. In addition, we have agreements with other third-party manufacturers to manufacture products on our behalf. Should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness or catastrophic weather events, the inability to manufacture at the affected facility may result in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. We may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production. Although we maintain insurance for damage to our property and disruption of our business from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses. Any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to produce sufficient inventory of our products or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory, and therefore, may adversely affect our net sales and operating results. Any disruption or delay at our manufacturing facilities could impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers, and our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to continue to enhance existing products and develop and market new or enhanced products that respond to customer needs and preferences, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products and our business could suffer.\nOne of our growth strategies is to develop innovative, customer-valued products to generate revenue growth. Our sales from new products in the past have represented a significant component of our sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future sales. We may not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of our customers, unless we can continue to enhance existing products and develop new innovative products in the global markets in which we compete. Product development requires significant financial, technological and other resources. While we expended $292.9 million, $259.7 million and $238.3 million for research and development efforts in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, there can be no assurance that this level of investment in research and development will be sufficient to maintain our competitive advantage in product innovation, which could cause our business to suffer. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant planning, design, development, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels and we may not be able to timely develop product improvements or new products. Our competitors\u2019 new products may beat our products to market and be more attractive with more features and/or less expensive than our products.\nOur continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of our Polaris brands which, if impaired, could adversely affect our sales.\nWe believe that our Polaris brands are one of the reasons our customers choose our products. To be successful, we must preserve our reputation. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions, and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of our company. It may be difficult to control negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. While reputations may take decades to build, any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in negative mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations, or litigation. Negative incidents, such as quality and safety concerns or incidents related to our products or actions or statements of our employees, could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business, including lost sales or employee retention and recruiting difficulties. In addition, vendors and others with whom we choose to do business may affect our reputation.\nIncreased negative public perception of our products or any increased restrictions on the access or the use of our products in certain locations could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products depends in part on their social acceptability. Public concerns about the environmental impact of the Company\u2019s products or their perceived safety could result in diminished public perception of the products we well. Government, media, or activist pressure to limit emissions could also negatively impact consumers\u2019 perceptions of the Company\u2019s products. Any decline in the social acceptability of the Company\u2019s products could negatively impact their sales or lead to changes in laws, rules and regulations that prevent their access to certain locations or restrict their use or manner of use in certain areas or during certain times, which could negatively impact\nsales. Any material decline in the social acceptability of the Company\u2019s products could impact the Company\u2019s ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe depend on suppliers, financing sources and other strategic partners who may be sensitive to economic conditions that could affect their businesses in a manner that adversely affects their relationship with us.\nWe source component parts and raw materials through numerous suppliers and have relationships with a limited number of product financing sources for our dealers and consumers. Our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected if deterioration of economic or business conditions results in a weakening of the financial condition of a material number of our suppliers or financing sources, or if uncertainty about the economy or the demand for our products causes these business partners to voluntarily or involuntarily reduce or terminate their relationship with us.\nWe intend to grow our business through potential acquisitions, non-consolidating investments, alliances and new joint ventures and partnerships, which could be risky and could harm our business.\nOne of our growth strategies is to drive growth in our businesses and accelerate opportunities to expand our global presence through targeted acquisitions, non-consolidating investments, alliances, and new joint ventures and partnerships that add value while considering our existing brands and product portfolio. The benefits of an acquisition, non-consolidating investment, new joint venture or partnership may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee that acquisitions, non-consolidating investments, alliances, joint ventures or partnerships will ultimately produce any benefits.\nThere can be no assurance that acquisitions will be consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions pose risks with respect to our ability to project and evaluate market demand, potential synergies and cost savings, make correct accounting estimates and achieve anticipated business goals and objectives. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. If acquired businesses do not achieve forecasted results or otherwise fail to meet projections, it could affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions present a number of integration risks. For example, the acquisition may: disrupt operations in core, adjacent or acquired businesses; require more time than anticipated to be fully integrated into our operations and systems; create more costs than projected; divert management attention; create the potential of losing customer, supplier or other critical business relationships; and pose difficulties retaining employees. The inability to successfully integrate new businesses may result in higher production costs, lost sales or otherwise negatively affect earnings and financial results.\nOur business, properties and products are subject to extensive United States federal and state and international safety, environmental and other government regulation and any failure to comply with these regulations could harm our reputation, expose us to damages and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur business, properties, and products are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and other governmental laws, rules, and regulations relating to, among other things: climate change; emissions to air; discharges to water; restrictions placed on water and land usage and water availability; product and associated packaging; use of certain chemicals; import and export compliance, including country of origin certification requirements; worker and product user health and safety; energy efficiency; product life-cycles; outdoor noise laws; and the generation, use, handling, labeling, collection, management, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, and other regulated materials. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of adopted or future laws, rules, and regulations on our business, properties, or products.\nAny of these laws, rules, or regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses to achieve or maintain compliance, require us to modify our products, adversely affect the price of or demand for some of our products, and ultimately affect the way we conduct our operations. Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules, or regulations could result in harm to our reputation and/or could lead to fines and other penalties, including restrictions on the importation of our products into, and the sale of our products in, one or more jurisdictions until compliance is achieved. In addition, changes to regulations may require us to incur expenses or modify product offerings in order to maintain compliance with the actions of regulators and could decrease the demand for our products.\nFailure to establish and maintain the appropriate level of dealers and distributor relationships or weak economic conditions impacting those relationships may negatively impact our business and operating results.\nWe distribute our products through numerous dealers and distributors and rely on them to retail our products to the end customers. Our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected if deterioration of economic or business conditions results in a weakening of the financial condition of a material number of our dealers and distributors. Additionally, weak demand for, or quality issues with, our products may cause dealers and distributors to voluntarily or involuntarily reduce or terminate their relationship with us. Further, if we fail to establish and maintain an appropriate level of dealers and distributors for each of our products, we may not obtain adequate market coverage for the desired level of retail sales of our products.\nRetail credit market deterioration and volatility may restrict the ability of our retail customers to finance the purchase of our products and adversely affect our income from financial services.\nWe have arrangements with each of Performance Finance, Sheffield Financial and Synchrony Bank to make retail financing available to consumers who purchase our products in the United States. During 2019, consumers financed approximately 32 percent of the vehicles we sold in the United States through these installment retail credit programs. Furthermore, some customers use financing from lenders who do not partner with us, such as local banks and credit unions. There can be no assurance that retail financing will continue to be available in the same amounts and under the same terms that had been previously available to our customers. If retail financing is not available to customers on satisfactory terms, it is possible that our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\n( Our reliance upon patents, trademark laws, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from others who may sell similar products and may lead to costly litigation.\nWe hold patents and trademarks relating to various aspects of our products, such as our patented \u201con demand\u201d all-wheel drive, and believe that proprietary technical know-how is important to our business. Proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or trademarks or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. We cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In the absence of enforceable patent or trademark protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, gain access to our trade secrets and know-how or diminish our brand through unauthorized use of our trademarks, all of which could adversely affect our business. Others may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, or allege that we infringe their patents, or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe our patents. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, or allege that we infringe their patents, or if we initiate proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. Regardless of whether litigation relating to our intellectual property rights is successful, the litigation could significantly increase our costs and divert management\u2019s attention from operation of our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We also cannot be certain that our products or technologies have not infringed or will not infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs, possible damages and substantial uncertainty.\nOur international operations require significant management attention and financial resources, expose us to difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting, and business factors, and may not be successful or produce desired levels of sales and profitability.\nWe intend to continue to expand our international operations as one part of our long-term strategic objectives. To support that strategy, we must increase our presence outside of North America, including adding employees and continuing to invest in business infrastructure and operations. These investments might not produce the returns we expect, which could adversely affect our profitability. International operations and sales also are inherently subject to various risks. These risks include political and economic instability, increased costs of customizing products for foreign countries, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers, the impact of foreign government laws and regulations and United States laws and regulations that apply to international operations, the effects of income and withholding taxes, governmental expropriation and differences in business practices, and multiple, changing, and often inconsistent enforcement of laws, rules, and regulations, including rules relating to environmental, health, and safety matters. The realization of any of these risks or unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory and business climate in\nany of the jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our total sales, financial condition, profitability, or cash flows.\nChanging weather conditions may reduce demand and negatively impact net sales and production of certain of our products.\nUnfavorable weather conditions may reduce demand and negatively impact sales of certain of the Company\u2019s products. Lack of snowfall in any year in any particular geographic region may adversely affect snowmobile retail sales and related PG&A sales in that region. Unfavorable weather in any particular geographic region may have a material adverse effect on sales of the Company\u2019s products in that region. In particular, lack of snowfall during winter may materially adversely affect snowmobile sales, while excessive rain before and during spring and summer may materially adversely affect sales of off-road vehicles, ATVs, and boats. Additionally, to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or other factors, our sales may be affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced. There is no assurance that weather conditions or natural disasters could not have a material effect on our sales, production capability or component supply continuity for any of our products.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and trade names could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Our determination of whether goodwill impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units\u2019 fair market value with its carrying value. Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant and long-term adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, and/or changes in technology or markets, could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could negatively impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding and must comply with restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\nOur credit agreement and other debt agreements contain financial and restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, borrow additional funds or take advantage of business opportunities. While we are currently in compliance with the financial covenants, increases in our debt or decreases in our earnings could cause us to fail to comply with these financial covenants. Failing to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our indebtedness or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and debt service capability.\nOur level of debt and the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our credit agreement could have important consequences on our financial position and results of operations, including increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates because debt under our credit agreement bears interest at variable rates.\nAdditional tax expense or tax exposure could impact our financial performance.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other business taxes in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the earnings generated in these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. We also have negotiated and are party to certain tax incentives that require the Company comply with certain covenants. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures or the loss of any tax incentive may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\nOur operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining senior executives and skilled employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and promote skilled personnel for all areas of our organization and to retain or provide for adequate succession planning for our senior executives.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Many members of the Company\u2019s management team have extensive experience in the Company\u2019s industry and with its business, products and customers. The unplanned loss of some or all of the members of Company\u2019s management team, particularly if\ncombined with difficulties in finding qualified substitutes, could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to develop and pursue its business strategy, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the Company\u2019s success depends to a large extent upon its ability to retain skilled employees. There is intense competition for qualified and skilled employees, and the Company\u2019s failure to recruit, train and retain such employees could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology systems and connected products that could adversely affect our business.\nWe use many information technology systems and manufacture connected products (including connected vehicles), some of which are managed by third parties, in operating our business. Those systems and products process sensitive information, including intellectual property; proprietary business information of Polaris and our dealers, suppliers, and other business partners; and personal information of consumers and employees. Our systems and products have been, and could be in the future vulnerable to breach, damage, disruption, or breakdown from various sources, power loss, viruses, malware, ransomware, phishing, denial of service, and other cyber-attacks that may be random, targeted, or the result of misconduct of error by individuals with access to our systems. While we invest in layers of data and information technology protection, and monitor continually evolving cybersecurity threats, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent disruptions or breaches of our systems and connected products.\nWe have experienced cyber-attacks, but to our knowledge, we have not experienced any material disruptions or breaches of our information technology systems or connected products. We could, however, experience material disruptions or breaches in the future. Such disruptions or breaches of our information technology systems and connected products could adversely affect our business by resulting in, among other things: (i) disruption to our business operations; (ii) compromise or loss of the information processed by those systems and products, such as intellectual property, proprietary information, or personal information; (iii) impact to the performance and/or safety of our connected products; (iv) damage to our reputation; and (v) litigation or regulatory proceedings. We are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other countries concerning the handling of personal information, including laws that require us to notify governmental authorities and/or affected individuals of data breaches involving certain personal information. These laws and regulations include, for example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective May 25, 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), effective January 1, 2020. Regulatory actions or litigation seeking to impose significant penalties could be brought against us in the event of a data breach or alleged non-compliance with such laws and regulations.", "PERMNO": 75182, "SIC": 3790, "TIC": "PII"}
