{"cik": "1145460", "company": "ALERE INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-08-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below may materially impact your investment in our company or may in the future, and, in some cases already do, materially affect us and our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider these factors with respect to your investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe proposed acquisition of Alere by Abbott may cause disruption in our business.\nOn January 30, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott will merge with and into Alere, with Alere surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott. The terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, whether or not consummated, may have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the proposed merger and restricts us, without Abbott\u2019s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the merger is completed. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute on our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals, including continuing efforts to transform our business in accordance with strategic goals established by our management. For example, we are prohibited from offering securities or issuing additional indebtedness and there may be circumstances in the future where it would be necessary or desirable to obtain additional funding in order to fund working capital, refinance existing indebtedness, fund operations or acquire businesses or technologies and we may be unable to do so without Abbott\u2019s approval, and the failure to obtain such approval may harm our business. Additionally, the announcement of the proposed merger, whether or not consummated, may impact our relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, regulators and other third parties.\nFailure to complete the merger in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market prices of our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock, as well as our future business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently anticipate that the merger will close by the end of 2016, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions to the proposed merger will be satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived. The merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied or (if\npermissible under applicable law) waived, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of our common stock and the receipt of required antitrust approvals. The obligation of each of the parties to the Merger Agreement to consummate the proposed merger is also conditioned on the other party\u2019s representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions) and the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations imposed under the Merger Agreement. In the event that the merger is not completed for any reason, the holders of our common stock will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the proposed merger. Instead, Alere will remain an independent public company and holders of our common stock will continue to own their shares of our common stock.\nAfter entering into the Merger Agreement, Abbott informed us that it had serious concerns about, among other things, the accuracy of various representations, warranties and covenants made by us in the Merger Agreement. Abbott indicated that these concerns relate to the delay in filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as well as governmental investigations previously announced by us. Abbott has since requested information from us about these and other matters, citing contractual rights to receive information under the Merger Agreement. In the initial meeting in which Abbott expressed its concerns to us, as part of a discussion about potential paths forward, Abbott requested that we agree to terminate the Merger Agreement in return for a payment by Abbott to us in the range of $30 to $50 million in respect of our transaction expenses. Our Board of Directors promptly rejected that request. In these discussions, Abbott affirmed its commitment to abide by its obligations under the Merger Agreement. There can be no guarantee that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will close, and we may be required to engage in expensive and time-consuming litigation in connection with any actions or alleged breach of the Merger Agreement. The outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted or guaranteed.\nAdditionally, if the merger is not consummated in a timely manner or at all, our ongoing business may be adversely affected as follows:\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the market prices of our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nthe manner in which customers, suppliers and other third parties perceive us may be negatively impacted, which in turn may affect our ability to compete for business;\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from employees;\n\u2022\nwe will have expended significant time and resources that could otherwise have been spent on our existing business;\n\u2022\nwe may be required, in certain circumstances, including if we terminate the Merger Agreement to accept an alternative takeover proposal from a third-party or if our board of directors changes its recommendation that our common stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, to pay Abbott a termination fee of $177.0 million; and\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to additional litigation in relation to the proposed merger, including any failure to complete the merger.\nIn addition, if the proposed merger does not occur, we will nonetheless remain liable for expenses that we have incurred related to the proposed merger. The payment of such transaction expenses and the payment of the termination fee described above would have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be subject to litigation in relation to the proposed merger or in the event the merger is not consummated, which could subject us to liability for damages and result in the incurrence of significant legal fees.\nWe may be unable to obtain the approvals required to complete the proposed merger.\nThe consummation of the proposed merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including the approval of the holders of our common stock and receipt of certain\ndomestic and foreign antitrust approvals. If we are unable to obtain these approvals, we may be unable to consummate the proposed merger. We cannot predict whether the closing conditions to the proposed merger set forth in the Merger Agreement will be satisfied or whether the required antitrust approvals will be received. As a result, we cannot assure you that the proposed merger will be completed. On May 2, 2016, Abbott and Alere received a request for additional information, or a \u201csecond request,\u201d from the FTC relating to Abbott\u2019s potential acquisition of Alere. The second request was issued under the HSR Act. In addition, Abbott has agreed voluntarily to provide the FTC at least 60 days advance notice before certifying substantial compliance with the second request and to extend the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 60 days after Abbott and Alere have substantially complied with the second request, unless the period is further extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the FTC. On June 23, 2016, Abbott and Alere received a request for additional information, or a \u201csupplemental information request,\u201d from the Canadian Competition Bureau, or the Bureau, relating to Abbott\u2019s potential acquisition of Alere. The supplemental information request was issued under the Competition Act of Canada, or the Competition Act. The effect of the supplemental information request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the Competition Act until 30 days after Abbott and Alere have each complied with the supplemental information request, unless the period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the Bureau. If the closing conditions, including the receipt of required antitrust approvals, for the proposed merger set forth in the Merger Agreement are not satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived pursuant to the Merger Agreement, or if the proposed merger is not completed for any other reason, the market prices of our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock would likely decline.\nWe may lose management personnel and other key employees and be unable to attract and retain such personnel and employees.\nUncertainties about the effect of the proposed merger on management personnel and other employees may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the proposed merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Business Operations\nWe face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively may negatively affect sales of our products and services.\nCompetition in the medical diagnostics product and other markets in which we operate is intense and expected to increase as new products, services and technologies become available and new competitors enter the market. Our competitors in the U.S. and abroad are numerous and include, among others, diagnostic testing and medical products companies, universities and other research institutions. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities, clinical, manufacturing, regulatory and marketing experience and financial and managerial resources than we do. Our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected by:\n\u2022\ncustomers\u2019 perceptions of the comparative quality of our competitors\u2019 products or services;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture, in a cost-effective way, sufficient quantities of our products to meet customer demand;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our competitors to develop products, services and technologies that are more effective than ours or that render ours obsolete;\n\u2022\nour competitors\u2019 ability to obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would prevent us from offering competing products or services;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our competitors to obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of products or services more rapidly or effectively than we do; and\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing by our competitors, particularly in emerging markets.\nIn addition, as the number of competing products increases in the markets we serve, including the increased competition for our meter-based Alere Triage BNP test, the sales unit volume and average selling prices for our products may decline, which may adversely impact our product sales, gross margins and overall financial results. This may occur even if we are able to successfully introduce new products in these markets, and achieve market acceptance of those products, in a timely manner.\nWe face risks and uncertainties relating to the FDA warning letter and OIG subpoena.\nOn October 9, 2012, we received a warning letter from the FDA referencing inspectional observations set forth in a Form FDA 483 received in June 2012. The observations were the result of an inspection of our San Diego facility conducted earlier during 2012 relating to our Alere Triage products, which resulted in two recalls of certain Alere Triage products and revised release specifications for our Alere Triage meter-based products. In September 2014, as a follow up to a further inspection of our San Diego facility, the FDA notified us that this inspection was classified \u201cvoluntary action indicated,\u201d meaning that the objectionable conditions or practices found in the inspection did not meet the threshold of significance requiring regulatory action, but that formal close-out of the October 2012 warning letter could not occur until after a future inspection.\nIn May 2012, we also received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or the OIG, seeking documents relating primarily to the quality control testing and performance characteristics of Alere Triage products. We are cooperating with the OIG and are responding to the investigation, which is ongoing.\nWe cannot assure you that the government will find our efforts to resolve the FDA warning letter or the investigation initiated by the OIG subpoena to be satisfactory. We may be unable to implement corrective actions within a timeframe or in a manner satisfactory to the FDA. Previous potential violations relating to the matters under review by the FDA and/or OIG, as well as failure to timely implement corrective actions can result in enforcement proceedings by the government, which may include potential civil or criminal fines and penalties, including disgorgement of amounts earned on any legally-adulterated products (the amount of such fines and/or penalties may be significant;) injunctive relief, which could limit, modify or constrain our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products; and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We have received inquiries from regulatory authorities outside the U.S. regarding the Alere Triage recalls in the U.S. and, in at least one case, remedial or corrective action was required. We cannot predict whether other governments\u2019 regulatory authorities will require additional remedial or corrective actions in the future. The investigation initiated by the OIG subpoena can also result in civil or criminal fines or penalties (the amount of such fines and/or penalties may be significant), increased supervision of our business operations by the OIG, or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We are unable to predict when these matters will be resolved or what action, if any, the government will take in connection with these matters. The issues arising out of the FDA inspection and OIG subpoena may be expanded to cover other matters. We can also face product liability, third-party payer, shareholder, or other litigation. Any of these risks and uncertainties can adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to ongoing SEC and Department of Justice investigations.\nOn August 28, 2015, we received a subpoena from the SEC which indicated that it is conducting a formal investigation of Alere. The SEC\u2019s subpoena relates to, among other things, (i) our previously filed restatement and revision to our financial statements, including the accounting for deferred taxes for discontinued operations, as well as our tax strategies and policies, and (ii) our sales practices and dealings with third parties (including distributors and foreign government officials) in Africa relating to sales to government entities. On January 14, 2016, we received a second subpoena from the SEC in connection with this formal investigation seeking, among other things, additional information related to\nsales of products and services to end-users in Africa, as well as revenue recognition relating to sales of products and services to end-users in Africa. We have also received, from time to time, requests in connection with the investigation to voluntarily produce additional information to the SEC, including information pertaining to certain other countries in Asia and Latin America. In addition, on March 11, 2016, we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Department of Justice requiring the production of documents relating to, among other things, sales, sales practices and dealings with third parties (including distributors and foreign governmental officials) in Africa, Asia and Latin America and other matters related to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We are in the process of responding to these subpoenas and requests for information and are cooperating with the SEC and Department of Justice investigations.\nThese investigations have resulted and are expected to continue to result in considerable legal expenses and diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. The amount of time needed to resolve the investigations is uncertain, and we cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, whether we will face additional government inquiries or other actions or whether the scope of these investigations will expand. If the SEC were to file an action, we could be required to pay significant penalties and/or other amounts and could become subject to either an injunction or an administrative cease-and-desist order, which could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, business, results of operations, and cash flow. In addition, the investigation initiated by the Department of Justice could result in civil or criminal penalties, including fines or other penalties that may be material to our business. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees in connection with the ongoing investigations and any future government inquiries, investigations, or actions. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of any of these matters.\nWe may experience difficulties that delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products or services.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively introduce new and competitive products and services. The development of new or enhanced products or services is a complex, costly and uncertain process and is becoming increasingly complex and uncertain in the U.S. We have, in recent quarters, reduced our research and development expenses, and there is no guarantee that our more focused research and development efforts will allow us to continue to introduce new products or improve our existing products as we had in the past, or at all. Furthermore, developing and manufacturing new products and services require us to anticipate customers\u2019 and patients\u2019 needs and emerging technology trends accurately. We may experience research and development, manufacturing, regulatory, marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our introduction of new or enhanced products and services. The research and development process in the healthcare industry generally takes a significant amount of time from design stage to product launch. This process is conducted in various stages, and each stage presents the risk that we will not achieve our goals. We may have to abandon a product in which we have invested substantial resources. We cannot be certain that:\n\u2022\nany of our products or services under development will prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe will be able to obtain, in a timely manner or at all, necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe products and services we develop can be manufactured or provided at acceptable cost and with appropriate quality; or\n\u2022\nthese products and services, if and when approved, can be successfully marketed.\nThese factors, as well as manufacturing or distribution problems or other factors beyond our control, could delay the launch of new or enhanced products or services. Any delay in the development, approval, production, marketing or distribution of a new product or service could materially and adversely affect our competitive position, our branding and our results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our net revenue from outside the U.S., and a significant number of our employees, including manufacturing, sales, support, and research and development personnel, are located outside the U.S., including in Africa, Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Norway, the Philippines, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Conducting business outside the U.S. subjects us to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe negative impact of foreign exchange rates, which had a significant negative impact on our results of operations in 2015;\n\u2022\nlost revenues as a result of macroeconomic developments, such as the recent European budgetary issues, debt crisis and related European financial restructuring efforts, which caused European governments to reduce spending and cause the value of the Euro to further deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of European customers and the dollar value of European sales;\n\u2022\ndecreased liquidity resulting from longer accounts receivable collection cycles typical of foreign countries;\n\u2022\nlower productivity resulting from difficulties we encounter in staffing and managing sales, support, and research and development operations across many countries;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or unexpected expenses resulting from difficulties associated with enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or unexpected expenses resulting from disputes with third-party distributors of our products or from third parties claiming distribution rights to our products under foreign laws or legal systems;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or unexpected expenses resulting from the imposition by foreign governments of trade barriers such as tariffs, quotas, preferential bidding, and import restrictions;\n\u2022\nhigher cost of sales resulting from import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or other adverse effects resulting from acts of war, terrorism, theft or other lawless conduct or otherwise resulting from economic, social or political instability in or affecting foreign countries in which we sell our products or operate;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or other adverse effects resulting from international sanctions regimes;\n\u2022\nadverse effects resulting from changes in foreign regulatory or other laws affecting sales of our products or our foreign operations;\n\u2022\ngreater tax liability resulting from international tax laws, including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nincreased costs to comply with changes in legislative or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or increased expenses resulting from the failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nlost revenues resulting from delays in obtaining import or export licenses, transportation difficulties and delays resulting from inadequate local infrastructure.\nOur international operations subject us to varied and complex domestic, foreign and international laws and regulations, as further discussed below. Compliance with these laws and regulations often involves significant costs or requires changes in our business practices that may reduce revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, on June 23, 2016, voters in the U.K. approved an advisory vote calling for that country\u2019s exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. As a result of the referendum, it is\nexpected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the E.U. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, the effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions, and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers, and employees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including with respect to medical devices, as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate.\nThe announcement of Brexit may also create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget on our products and services. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe could incur additional legal and compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties if we do not comply with certain regulations.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to a number of legal requirements relating to our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the customs, export, trade sanctions and anti-boycott laws of the U.S., including those administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Department of Commerce and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department, as well as similar agencies in other nations in which we do business. Compliance with these laws and regulations is complex and involves significant costs. In addition, our training and compliance programs and our other internal control policies may not always prevent or detect acts committed by our employees, distributors or agents that may violate these laws. Any violation of these legal requirements by us, our employees or our agents and distributors could potentially subject us to civil liability or criminal liability and result in restrictions on our operations.\nBecause our business relies heavily on foreign operations and revenues, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and our need to convert currencies may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business relies heavily on our foreign operations. We have significant manufacturing operations in Canada, China, Germany, Japan, Norway, South Korea and the United Kingdom, and we also have additional manufacturing operations in other countries. We have significant research and development operations in Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom, and we conduct additional research and development activities in China, Japan, South Korea and other locations in the United Kingdom. In 2015, approximately 44% of our net revenue was derived from sales outside the U.S. Because of the scope of our foreign operations and foreign sales, we face significant exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as our business practices evolve and could result in increased costs or reduced revenue and could affect our cash flow. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and, in some instances, may have a significant impact on our operating results. For 2015, the decrease in total revenue as compared to 2014 was partially attributable to a $119.4 million negative impact due to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Recent events, including the announcement of Brexit, have led to significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can cost-effectively mitigate these risks.\nThe revision of our previously issued financial statements has been time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including additional stockholder litigation and loss of investor confidence.\nAs discussed herein, we have revised our previously issued audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, and our interim financial statements for 2014 and 2015. These revisions (including the review of the errors that necessitated revisions of our financial statements) have been time consuming and expensive. In addition, in 2015, we determined that we should restate our previously issued audited financial statements for 2014 and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 (and revise our financial statements for certain earlier periods) as a result of errors that resulted from a material weakness relating to the accounting for income taxes. We have incurred unanticipated expenses and costs, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees, in connection with the restatement and revision of our previously issued financial statements and the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and any further revision or restatement of our financial statements would likely cause us to incur significant additional accounting, legal, consulting and other professional fees and expenses, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and could expose us to potential claims and additional risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Certain remediation actions have been recommended and we are in the process of implementing them (see Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of these remediation measures). To the extent these steps are not successful, we could be exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn addition, any additional revisions or restatements of our financial statements may lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading prices of our securities. Any of these matters could adversely affect on our business, reputation, revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, which have not been remediated, and these or other material weaknesses could impair our ability to report accurate financial information in a timely manner and/or increase the risk of future errors, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn connection with the preparation and filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2014, our management concluded that we had a material weakness as of December 31, 2014 related to the failure to design controls to assess the accounting for deferred taxes related to dispositions. During the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements and other financial data for the three months ended March 31, 2015, we identified errors in our consolidated financial statements for 2014 and all interim periods therein relating primarily to the accounting for income taxes for our discontinued operations. Following the completion of our review of those errors and related matters, our audit committee determined that we should restate our consolidated financial statements for 2014 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. As a result of the restatement, we were unable to timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Subsequently, during the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements and other financial data for the three months ended September 30, 2015, management identified and corrected errors in our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 relating to U.S. taxes on foreign earnings for 2014. Management concluded that these errors were the result of a material weakness in that we did not maintain a sufficient complement of resources with adequate experience and expertise in accounting for income taxes. In November 2015, we amended our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2014 to revise both management\u2019s annual report on internal control over financial reporting and the related report of our independent registered public accounting firm. This material weakness related to accounting for income taxes had not been remediated as of December 31, 2015.\nAs described in Item 9A, in connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management concluded that we had the following material weaknesses related to revenue recognition: (i) we did not maintain a sufficient complement of resources at our subsidiaries with appropriate knowledge, experience and training to ensure proper application of US GAAP in determining revenue recognition, (ii) we also did not maintain effective controls over information and communications as it relates to revenue recognition at our subsidiaries (specifically, we did not implement and reinforce an adequate process for internally communicating nonstandard terms and conditions between our subsidiaries\u2019 commercial operations and finance groups and between our subsidiaries\u2019 finance groups and our corporate accounting group), (iii) we did not design effective controls over the review of terms of purchase orders and customer contracts, including amendments to contracts, to ensure proper application of US GAAP in determining revenue recognition and (iv) we did not design effective controls to ensure that revenue would not be recognized until title and risk of loss had passed to our customers.\nIn connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(c) under the Exchange Act, our management concluded that the material weaknesses identified in Item 9A existed and had not been remediated as of December 31, 2015, and, therefore, that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or effective disclosure controls and procedures as of that date. While we are continuing to take steps to remediate these material weaknesses, our remedial measures may not be adequate to prevent additional errors or avoid other control deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to taxes, revenue recognition or any other matters. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including judgments used in decision making, the nature and complexity of the transactions we undertake, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the adequacy of training and experience, the possibility of human error, the existence and sufficiency of any appropriate compensating controls, cost limitations and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of internal control over financial reporting will be successful in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, our financial statements may contain one or more material misstatements and may not be available on a timely basis or we may discover additional material weaknesses related to taxes, revenue recognition or other matters, any of which could cause investors to lose confidence in us and lead to, among other things, additional legal, accounting and other expenses, delays in filing required financial disclosures, events of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our notes (or significant payments to amend such agreements), additional or expanded investigations or enforcement actions by government authorities, fines, penalties, the delisting of our securities, a decline in the prices of our securities and liabilities arising from stockholder litigation.\nDelays in the filing of future Exchange Act reports, the related financial statements and other required securities reporting obligations may result in a default under our secured credit facility and/or one or more of the indentures governing our outstanding notes and has caused us to delay issuances of shares under our equity plans, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf we discover additional errors in our financial statements, whether or not those errors require a revision or restatement of our financial statements, or if our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in the future, we may be unable to comply with our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and other securities laws in a timely manner.\nDue to the material weakness with respect to revenue recognition, we were unable to file this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2016, or the First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q, on a timely basis. As a result of this delay, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement for our secured credit facility, or the April 2016 Amendment, and solicited consents from the requisite holders of our senior notes and senior subordinated notes, or the Consent Solicitations, to waive certain defaults and extend the deadline dates for the filing and delivery, as applicable, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q and certain related deliverables in order to avoid events of default under the credit agreement governing our secured credit facility, or the Credit Agreement, and the indentures governing our notes. Through July 20, 2016, we have paid an aggregate of $25.9 million (including fees incurred in connection therewith) in connection with the April 2016 Amendment and the Consent Solicitations. The April 2016 Amendment also increases the applicable interest rate margins for all loans outstanding under our secured credit facility by 0.25% per annum for the period from July 1, 2016 to the date of delivery of such financial reports and related deliverables under our secured credit facility.\nIf the First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q is not filed when required under these arrangements, we may be in default due to the breach of the reporting covenants in the Credit Agreement or the indentures governing our notes. Under the terms of the April 2016 Amendment, we are required to deliver the First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q and certain related deliverables on or before August 18, 2016, and our failure to do so could give rise to an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Such an event of default would impact our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility and could lead to an acceleration of our secured credit facility. Under the terms of the Consent Solicitations, we are required to deliver the First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q on or before August 31, 2016, and our failure to do so could give rise to events of default under the indentures governing our notes, and such events of default could lead to an acceleration of our notes. Any acceleration of our secured credit facility or any of our notes could result in a cross-acceleration of all other such debt. If our secured credit facility or any of our notes are accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy those debt obligations. While we may be successful in obtaining relief or further extensions of time under the Credit Agreement or the indentures governing our notes for the filing and delivery of our First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q and related deliverables, we cannot guarantee that such relief or extension would be granted or, if granted, would provide us with a sufficient period of time to cure the reporting defaults. In addition, in order to obtain any such relief or extension, we may be required to accept terms that are adverse to us and we would likely incur significant additional fees and related costs.\nIn addition, during the period in which we were not in compliance with our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, we ceased issuing shares of our common stock under our equity incentive programs. We plan to resume issuing shares under these incentive programs once we are in compliance with such reporting obligations. If holders of equity awards determine that they have been financially harmed as a result of this delay in their ability to exercise awards, it could damage the morale of our employees and they may commence litigation against us. While we believe that we are in compliance with applicable law and the terms of these equity incentive plans and individual award agreements, we may become involved in litigation that may be costly and time-consuming and an ultimate resolution in our favor cannot be guaranteed.\nHealthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010), or the ACA, makes comprehensive reforms at the federal and state level affecting the coverage and payment for healthcare services in the U.S. The ACA contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of Medicare and Medicaid. While certain provisions of the ACA took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates. Given the scope of the changes made by the ACA and the ongoing implementation efforts, we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the new law on our operations.\nIn particular, the ACA significantly alters Medicare Advantage reimbursements by setting the federal benchmark payment closer to the payments in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. This change has reduced our revenues from the Medicare Advantage plans for which we perform services, although the precise effect on any particular plan, much less the impact on us, going forward is impossible to predict. Effective January 1, 2013, the ACA includes a 2.3% excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices sold outside of the retail setting. For 2014 and 2015, we incurred $9.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, in excise tax expense related to the domestic sale of our medical device products as a result of the implementation of this tax. Although a moratorium has been imposed on this excise tax for 2016 and 2017, the excise tax is currently scheduled to be restored in 2018. Also, legislative provisions impose federal reporting requirements regarding payments or relationships between manufacturers of covered drugs, devices or biological or medical supplies, and physicians, among others.\nSince 2013, revenues associated with our diabetes business have been impacted by the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies, or the DMEPOS, Competitive Bidding Program operated by CMS. Under this program, Medicare no longer reimburses suppliers for certain products and services, including mail-order diabetes testing supplies, based on the Medicare fee schedule amount. Instead, CMS provides reimbursement for those products and services based on a competitive bidding process. There is no guarantee that we will prevail in this bidding process in the future, and a failed bid would significantly harm our cardiometabolic operations. Further, while the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program limits the number of potential participants in the mail-order diabetes testing supplies market, it also requires us to sell diabetes supplies subject to Medicare reimbursement at significantly lower prices, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the profitability of these products. Moreover, under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, certain laboratories and physician offices, including certain of our labs, are required to collect and report private payor rate and volume data, which CMS will use in determining new Medicare CLFS rates for 2017. The new Medicare CLFS rates may provide for lower reimbursement for our products and services, which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nChanges to CMS reimbursement policies for drugs of abuse that were implemented in 2016 may also have a negative impact on our toxicology business.\nLegislative and regulatory bodies, including Congress, are likely to continue to pursue healthcare reform initiatives and may continue to reduce the funding of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare Advantage, in an effort to reduce overall healthcare spending. The ultimate impact of all of the reforms in the ACA or other health care laws, and their impact on us, is impossible to predict. If all of the reforms in the legislation are implemented, or if other reforms in the United States or elsewhere are adopted, those reforms may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the results of clinical studies required to gain regulatory approval to sell our products are not available when expected, or do not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of those products, we may be unable to sell those products.\nBefore commercializing certain of our products, we must conduct clinical studies involving human subjects or specimens exhibiting symptoms of the disease or medical condition that the product is intended to diagnose or evaluate. Results of these clinical studies, as well as other internally generated data, are used to obtain market clearance or approval from government authorities such as the FDA by establishing that the device is safe and effective for its intended use or, in the case of premarket clearance, is substantially equivalent to a similar marketed device. In order to protect the welfare of human subjects, Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval is required before initiation of a clinical study and, in the case of studies involving significant risk devices, prior FDA approval is also required. Failure to comply with any applicable law or regulation or with any condition of approval imposed by the FDA or an IRB could result in early study termination or generation of data that cannot be used in support of a market clearance/approval application. For example, at any time during a clinical study,\nthe FDA may rescind its approval (or deny approval to commence a study) if, among other things, we fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation or any condition of approval imposed by the FDA or an IRB; any of our submissions to the FDA contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits material information required by FDA regulations; we fail to respond timely to a request for additional information by the FDA; there is reason to believe that the risks outweigh the benefits to the subjects; informed consent is inadequate; the investigation is scientifically unsound; there is reason to believe that the device as used is ineffective; or the manufacture of the clinical study product is inadequate.\nConducting clinical studies is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process, requiring months to several years to complete, and our studies are not guaranteed to generate data that demonstrates safety and effectiveness or substantial equivalence of the evaluated product. If we fail to adequately manage our clinical studies, those clinical studies and corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our products altogether. Even if we successfully manage our clinical studies, we may not obtain favorable results and may not obtain regulatory approval. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, or at all, whether due to inadequate management/execution of our studies or due to unfavorable results, would materially and adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain required clearances or approvals for the commercialization of our products in the United States, we would not be able to sell those products in the United States.\nOur future performance depends on, among other matters, the timely receipt of necessary regulatory approvals for new products. Regulatory approval can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, regulatory processes are subject to change, and new or changed regulations can result in increased costs and unanticipated delays.\nIn the U.S., clearance or approval to commercially distribute new medical devices is received from the FDA through clearance of a Premarket Notification 510(k), or 510(k), or through approval of a Premarket Application, or PMA. The FDA may deny 510(k) clearance because, among other reasons, it determines that a product is not substantially equivalent to another U.S. legally marketed device. The FDA may deny approval of a PMA because, among other reasons, it determines that a product is not sufficiently safe or effective. As part of the clearance or approval process, if we intend to sell certain diagnostic tests for home use or for use by laboratories holding a CLIA Certificate of Waiver, including most physician office laboratories, we must generally provide data demonstrating to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that the criteria for our tests are simple with a low risk of error. Failure to obtain FDA clearance or approval would preclude commercialization in the U.S. and failure to obtain or maintain CLIA-waived status for any product would preclude us from selling that product to CLIA-waived laboratories, which could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations.\nModifications or enhancements to a cleared or approved device that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness, or that constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, require submission of a new 510(k) or a PMA supplement or amendment. We have made modifications to some of our products since receipt of initial 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. With respect to several of these modifications, we filed new 510(k)s describing the modifications and received FDA 510(k) clearance. We have made other modifications to some of our products that we believe do not require the submission of new 510(k)s or PMA supplements or amendments. The FDA may not agree with any of our determinations not to submit a new 510(k) or a PMA supplement or amendment for any of these modifications made to our products. If the FDA requires us to submit a new 510(k) or a PMA supplement or amendment for any device modification, we may be prohibited from marketing the modified products until the new submission is cleared or approved by the FDA. As long as our San Diego facility remains subject to the FDA warning letter that we received in October 2012, that facility may be ineligible to receive PMA approvals. While no PMA submissions are currently pending for that facility and we do not plan any new PMA submissions for that facility in 2016, if we are unable to resolve the warning letter in a timely manner, our ability to gain approval for new or enhanced products for this facility could be adversely impacted.\nWe are subject to regulatory approval requirements of the foreign countries in which we sell our products, and these requirements may prevent or delay us from marketing our products in those countries.\nWe are subject to the regulatory approval requirements for each foreign country in which we sell our products. The process for complying with these approval requirements can be lengthy and expensive. Any changes in foreign approval requirements and processes may cause us to incur additional costs or lengthen review times of our products. We may not be able to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, and any failure to do so may cause us to incur additional costs or prevent us from marketing our products in foreign countries, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In order for us to market our products in some foreign countries, their governments require export certificates from the FDA seeking official assurance that products exported to their countries can be legally marketed in the United States or meet specific U.S. regulations, such as current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. If we are unable to obtain these certificates from the FDA, we may be unable to market our products in certain foreign countries.\nOur business is subject to substantial ongoing regulatory oversight and our failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in significant costs or, in certain circumstances, the suspension or withdrawal of previously obtained clearances or approvals.\nOur businesses are extensively regulated by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations impact many aspects of our operations, including development, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, physician interaction and record-keeping.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory agencies may require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the performance and use of approved products or may place conditions on any product approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of those products. The discovery of problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, including notices of correction or product recalls, such as our December 2014 voluntary urgent medical device correction initiated with respect to our Alere INRatio and Alere INRatio2 systems and our subsequent July 2016 decision to voluntarily withdraw the INRatio and INRatio2 systems from the market. For additional information on this plan to voluntarily withdraw these systems, see \u201cItem 1 Business-Government Regulation.\u201d This planned market withdrawal may divert management\u2019s time and attention as well as our financial resources. We do not expect to generate further meaningful revenue from sales of INRatio and INRatio2 systems, which generated approximately $20.4 million of revenue in 2015. As a result of this withdrawal, we have incurred and expect to incur certain charges. For additional information on these charges, see Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These and other product corrections, recalls and withdrawals could divert management time and attention, reduce market acceptance of all of our products, harm our reputation, lead to additional charges or expenses or result in product liability claims, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in some cases we may sell products or provide services which are reliant on the use or commercial availability of products of third parties, including medical devices, equipment or pharmaceuticals, and regulatory restrictions placed upon any such third-party products could have a material adverse impact on the sales or commercial viability of our related products or services. We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA and other agencies for compliance with the Quality System Regulation and Medical Device Reporting requirements in the United States and other applicable regulations worldwide. Our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers and distributors also are, or can be, subject to periodic regulatory inspections.\nUnder CLIA, some of our drug testing laboratories in the United States are required to be certified to meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections. Our laboratories that perform drug testing on\nemployees of federal government contractors and some other entities are regulated by the U.S. SAMHSA, which has established detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet in order to perform this work.\nPortions of our business are subject to unique licensing or permit requirements. For example, we may be required to obtain certification to participate in governmental payment programs, such as state or federal Medicaid/Medicare programs. Certain aspects of our business also require that we maintain supplier numbers that are authorized by government agencies to allow us to bill or be reimbursed by government agencies, such as CMS. For example, one of our subsidiaries has, in the past, had its Medicare supplier number deactivated by an enrollment contractor for CMS. While we were able to reactivate the supplier number and were reimbursed for all services we provided while the supplier number was deactivated, there can be no guarantee that one or more of our supplier numbers will not be deactivated in the future, or that we will be reimbursed for any materials or services supplied to customers during the period any number was deactivated, and such amounts may be material. In addition, we may need an operating license in some states. Failure to obtain or retain such supplier numbers, licenses or permits would negatively impact our business.\nWe are also subject to laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. In addition, many areas of our business, including but not limited to our diabetes supply and patient self-testing services, are subject to unique licensing or permit requirements by state and local health agencies. In addition, these and other areas of our business are subject to privacy regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. We are also required to obtain certification to participate in certain governmental payment programs, such as various state or federal Medicare/Medicaid programs. Some states have established Certificate of Need/Determination of Need, or CON/DON, programs regulating the expansion of healthcare operations. The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required licenses, certifications or CON/DONs or to comply with regulations related to privacy, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances could adversely affect our business.\nWe may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products or injunctions against our distribution of products, termination of our service agreements by our customers, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. Changes in applicable laws, changes in the interpretation or application of such laws, or any failure to comply with existing or future laws, regulations or standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects. Moreover, new laws may be enacted, or regulatory agencies may impose new or enhanced standards, that would increase our costs, as well as expose us to risks associated with non-compliance.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations that could result in significant liability, require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future.\nWe are subject to laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any payer, not only the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration programs. These laws constrain the\nsales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices and related services.\nOther laws, including the federal False Claims Act, generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the False Claims Act. These laws may also be triggered by failure to return identified overpayments to a payer. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and/or criminal penalties for noncompliance that can be substantial including, in some instances, fines, disgorgement of overpayments (which amounts may be material), imprisonment and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\nOn December 5, 2014, CMS issued a final rule titled \u201cRequirements for Medicare Incentive Reward Program and Provider Enrollment.\u201d This rule implemented several provider enrollment requirements, including a significant regulatory provision that will permit CMS to revoke Medicare billing privileges for a provider or supplier that has a pattern or practice of submitting claims that fail to meet Medicare requirements. The provisions of the rule became effective on February 3, 2015. In determining whether a provider or suppler is subject to revocation of its billing privileges pursuant to this rule, CMS will consider the following criteria:\n\u2022\nthe percentage of submitted claims that were denied;\n\u2022\nthe reason(s) for the claim denials;\n\u2022\nwhether the provider or supplier has any history of final adverse actions and the nature of any such actions;\n\u2022\nthe length of time over which the pattern continued;\n\u2022\nhow long the provider or supplier has been enrolled in Medicare; and\n\u2022\nany other information regarding the provider or supplier\u2019s specific circumstances that CMS deems relevant.\nSince we are reimbursed directly by federal healthcare programs for certain goods and services and, given that many of our customers rely on reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs to cover a substantial portion of their expenditures, our exclusion from such programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change.\nBilling and payment for healthcare services are highly regulated, and the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in civil or criminal sanctions, including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs.\nA portion of our healthcare products and services are paid for by private and governmental third-party payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These third-party payers typically have different and complex billing and documentation requirements that we must satisfy in order to receive payment, and they carefully audit and monitor our compliance with these requirements. Governmental payers and their agents, including Medicare Administrative Contractors, Zone Program Integrity Contractors, and others, as well as the Department of Health and Human Services, the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct audits in the ordinary course of our operations. These audits focus on compliance with coverage and reimbursement rules and guidelines under Medicare and Medicaid. These types of audits often lead to determinations that certain claims should not have been paid by Medicare and/or Medicaid, and the programs seek to recoup or offset amounts they assert have been paid in error. We regularly receive notices of such determinations of overpayment, which vary widely in amount. These\ndeterminations are subject to administrative appeal rights, which we routinely pursue. For example, Alere Toxicology Services, one of our subsidiaries successfully defended approximately 95% of a ZPICs recoupment request, and the remaining recoupment at issue continues to be appealed. The timeframe for these appeals can be long and the results are often unpredictable. Depending on the nature of the audit, overpayment determinations can be substantial. While we have had successful appeals, we have also, from time to time, been required to make repayments to both private and governmental third-party payers and, while these amounts have not been material, we may become obligated to make significant payments in the future.\nWe must also comply with numerous other laws applicable to billing and payment for healthcare services, including privacy laws. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in non-payment, refunds, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and civil or criminal liabilities, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. In addition, failure by third-party payers to properly process our payment claims in a timely manner could delay our receipt of payment for our products and services, which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows.\nDue to changes in the reimbursement policies and practices for pain management, our toxicology business has been adversely impacted and may continue to be negatively impacted in the future.\nThe pain management portion of our toxicology operations has, in the past few years, experienced a significant decrease in revenues. This decrease was the result, in part, of significant changes to reimbursement policies of third-party payors and the increasingly stringent application of standards related to the medical necessity of drug testing, which has resulted in lower pricing and test volume. We expect that these trends will continue in the future and that the pain management portion of our toxicology business will account for a smaller portion of revenue than it has in the past. In addition, since the margins on our pain management business are generally favorable compared with other portions of our business, these changes have had, and may continue to have, a disproportionately negative impact on our gross margins.\nIncreasing health insurance premiums and co-payments or high-deductible health plans may cause individuals to forgo health insurance and avoid medical attention, either of which may reduce demand for our products and services.\nHealth insurance premiums, co-payments and deductibles have generally increased in recent years. These increases may cause individuals to forgo health insurance, as well as medical attention. This behavior may reduce demand for our point-of-care diagnostic products.\nSecurities class action lawsuits have recently been filed against us and the outcome of these matters may adversely affect our business.\nIn April and May 2016, two class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain current and former officers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, asserting claims for violations of Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on behalf of a proposed class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock during the period May 9, 2013 through April 20, 2016. Both complaints seek damages allegedly attributable to allegedly materially misleading statements and/or omissions regarding our business, financial statements and operations. On July 11, 2016, the court entered an order consolidating the two actions and appointing lead plaintiffs and lead counsel, and on July 19, 2016, the court ordered a schedule for the filing of a consolidated amended complaint and for the motion to dismiss briefing. We and our current and former officers and directors may, in the future, be subject to additional litigation relating to such matters. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former officers and directors in connection with such lawsuits and any related litigation or settlement amounts. Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits, and any other litigation that may be brought against us could be time-consuming, result in significant expense and divert the attention and resources of our management.\nThe claims asserted span a multi-year period and the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged damages are not quantified. We are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss (if any) in this matter, at least until developments in the case have yielded additional information sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of reasonably possible loss. Depending on a range of factors, it may be months or years (if ever) before an estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss can be made. The plaintiffs have not yet filed a consolidated amended complaint in this action and we have not yet answered the complaint or asserted any defenses, nor have we engaged in any discussions or negotiations with any plaintiffs.\nOur ability to protect our information systems and electronic transmissions of sensitive data from data corruption, cyber-based attacks, security breaches or privacy violations is critical to the success of our business.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information, including personal information of our customers and our product end-users. A security breach of this infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, malware attacks by hackers and similar breaches, may cause all or portions of our networks and systems to be unavailable, create system disruptions or shutdowns, and lead to erasure of critical data and software or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We invest in security technology to protect our data against risks of data security breaches and cyber-attacks and we have implemented solutions, processes, and procedures to help mitigate these risks at various locations, such as encryption, virus protection, security firewalls and information security and privacy policies. Nonetheless, our information technology and infrastructure are subject to attacks by hackers and may be breached due to inadequacy, employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. The age of our information technology systems, as well as the level of our protection and business continuity or disaster recovery capability, varies from site to site, and there can be no guarantee that any such measures, to the extent they are in place, will be effective. In addition, a security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure of consumer information (including personally identifiable information or protected health information) could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with disparate state breach notification laws and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. For example, we were a defendant in a class action lawsuit, which was ultimately settled, in connection with the theft in 2012 of a laptop that contained personally identifiable information of approximately 116,000 patients. If we are unable to prevent security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, we may be subject to additional legal claims or proceedings, or we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we currently expend resources to protect against cyber-attacks and security breaches, hackers and other cyber criminals are using increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving techniques, and we may need to expend substantial additional resources to continue to protect against potential security breaches or to address problems caused by such attacks or any breach of our safeguards. In addition, a data security breach could distract management or other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. For example, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated a safe harbor on which we and other companies relied in order to transfer to the United States certain personal information subject to protections under European Union law. In February 2016, the European Commission and the United States reached a political agreement on the EU-US Privacy Shield, a new framework for data flows between the two jurisdictions. The EU-US Privacy Shield, if implemented, will impose more significant obligations on U.S. companies, including us, to protect the personal information of European citizens and also will require stronger monitoring and enforcement of personal privacy by the U.S. Department of Commerce and FTC. We also expect the European Union to adopt a Data Protection Regulation, which will\nreplace the existing European Union Data Protection Directive. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices or that our practices prior to implementation of the EU-US Privacy Shield will be found to be non-compliant with these laws. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our data practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nOur growth is subject to global economic and political conditions, and operational disruptions at our facilities.\nOur business is affected by global economic conditions and the state of the financial markets. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen or that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows, results of operations, financial positions or our ability to access capital, such as the adverse effects that may result from a prolonged shutdown in government operations in the United States or elsewhere. Our business is also affected by local economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, including inflation, recession, financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation. Political changes, such as the impact of Brexit, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers and our activities in a particular location.\nPoor economic conditions may negatively impact our toxicology business.\nThe high rates of unemployment in certain areas where we do business negatively impact the demand for pre-employment drug testing. Additionally, reduced government funding for drug screening programs negatively impacts the market for our toxicology tests. Finally, some of our domestic laboratory testing services are reimbursed by Medicare and private payers and are subject to continued downward price pressure. If any, or all, of these trends continue or accelerate, they may have a material adverse impact on the results of our toxicology business operations.\nIf we deliver products with alleged defects, we may be subject to product recalls or negative publicity, our credibility may be harmed, market acceptance of our products may decrease and we may be exposed to liability.\nThe manufacturing and marketing of professional and consumer diagnostics involve an inherent risk of product liability claims. For example, an alleged defect in one of our diagnostic products could lead to a false positive or false negative result, affecting the eventual diagnosis or treatment. Our product development and production are extremely complex and could expose our products to claims of defectiveness. Alleged manufacturing and design defects could lead to recalls (either voluntary or required by the FDA or other government authorities), could result in the removal of a product from the market and may require the payment of significant amounts in damages in connection with lawsuits. For example, in July 2016 we announced that we will be initiating a voluntary withdrawal of the Alere INRatio and INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring Systems. This planned withdrawal may lead to additional product liability claims or other claims relating to those products. For additional information on this matter, please see \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation\u201d elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Alleged defects in our products could also harm our reputation, lead to negative publicity and decrease sales of our products.\nIn addition, our marketing of monitoring services may cause us to be subjected to various product liability or other claims, including, among others, claims that inaccurate monitoring results lead to injury or death, or, in the case of our toxicology monitoring services, the imposition of criminal sanctions. For example, we have been subject to several individual lawsuits alleging that our INRatio products resulted in personal injury to certain users and class action lawsuits have been filed against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and the United States District Court\nfor the District of Massachusetts alleging, among other things, fraud, breach of warranty, unjust enrichment and violation of unfair competition/business practice statutes in connection with the manufacturing, marketing and sale of our INRatio products. For additional information on legal proceedings in connection with the INRatio and INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring Systems, see Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any product liability or other claim brought against us, regardless of merit, could be costly to defend and could result in an increase to our insurance premiums. If we are held liable for a claim, that claim could materially damage our business and financial condition. In addition, any publicity relating to the product defects or failures could negatively impact our reputation, result in decreased demand for our products and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe may experience manufacturing problems or delays due to, among other reasons, our volume and specialized processes, which could result in decreased revenue or increased costs.\nThe global supply of our products depends on the uninterrupted efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities. Many of our manufacturing processes are complex and involve sensitive scientific processes, including unique and often proprietary antibodies which cannot be replicated or acquired through alternative sources without undue delay or expense. Other processes present difficult technical challenges to obtain the manufacturing yields necessary to operate profitably. In addition, our manufacturing processes may require complex and specialized equipment which can be expensive to repair or replace with required lead times of up to a year.\nThe manufacturing of certain of our products is concentrated in one or more of our plants, with limited alternate facilities. Any event that negatively impacts our manufacturing facilities, our manufacturing systems or equipment, or our contract manufacturers or suppliers, such as a natural disaster or other event, could delay or suspend shipments of products or the release of new products or could result in the delivery of inferior products. Our revenues from the affected products would decline and we could incur losses until such time as we or our contract manufacturers are able to restore our or their production processes or we are able to put in place alternative contract manufacturers or suppliers.\nWe rely on suppliers for raw materials and other products and services, and fluctuations in the availability and price of such products and services may adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe rely on numerous third parties to supply raw materials and other components for our manufacturing processes. In some cases, these raw materials and components are available only from a sole supplier. We also rely on a number of significant third-party manufacturers to produce some of our professional diagnostics products. Stringent requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products may prevent us from quickly establishing additional or replacement sources for the raw materials, components or manufacturing services that we use or from doing so without excessive cost. As a result, a reduction or interruption in supply or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials, components or manufacturing services could have a material adverse effect on our business, result of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCompliance with the SEC\u2019s conflict minerals rules will continue to increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the SEC\u2019s disclosure requirements for public companies that manufacture, or contract to manufacture, products for which certain minerals and their derivatives, namely tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d are necessary to the functionality or production of those products. These regulations require us to determine which of our products contain conflict minerals and, if so, to perform an extensive inquiry into our supply chain in an effort to determine whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo, or DRC, or an\nadjoining country. We have incurred and expect to incur further additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Because our supply chain is complex, the country of origin inquiry and due diligence procedures that we have implemented have not enabled and may not enable us to ascertain the origins of all of conflict minerals that we use or determine that these minerals did not originate from the DRC or an adjoining country, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as DRC conflict-free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could also have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.\nWe could suffer monetary damages, incur substantial costs or be prevented from using technologies important to our products as a result of pending legal proceedings.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings arising out of our business. Because of the nature of our business, we may be subject at any particular time to commercial disputes, product liability and personal injury claims, negligence claims or various other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business, including infringement and other licensing and intellectual property claims, distributor disputes, privacy claims, employment matters or investor matters. The lawsuits we face generally seek damages, sometimes in substantial amounts, for commercial or personal injuries allegedly suffered and can include claims for punitive or other special damages. An adverse ruling or rulings in one or more such lawsuits could, individually or in the aggregate, substantially harm our sales, results of operations and financial performance.\nThe rights we rely upon to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our technology, which would reduce a competitive advantage provided by our proprietary technology.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to develop or acquire commercially valuable intellectual property rights and to enforce those rights. The degree of present and future protection for our intellectual property is uncertain and may change. The risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following:\n\u2022\npending patent applications we have filed, or to which we have exclusive rights, may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u2022\npatents licensed or issued to us or our customers may not provide a competitive advantage;\n\u2022\nother parties may challenge patents or patent applications licensed or issued to us or our customers;\n\u2022\nother companies may design around technologies we have patented, licensed or developed; and\n\u2022\nall patents have a limited life, meaning at some point valuable patents will expire and we will lose the competitive advantage they provide. For example, certain patents related to our lateral flow technology expired in 2015.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products. If these measures do not protect our rights, third parties could access our technology and our competitive advantage in the market would be reduced or eliminated. In addition, employees, consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property, and we may not have adequate remedies for\nthe breach. We also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries. For a variety of reasons, we may decide not to file for patent, copyright or trademark protection or prosecute potential infringements of our patents. Technology that we deem not to provide a commercial advantage when developed, and for which we elect not to file for patent or other formal protection, may become important to us in the future, at which time we may not be able to secure the same level of protection. Our trade secrets may also become known through other means not currently foreseen by us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors or customers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing any of our intellectual property rights, or design around our proprietary technologies.\nClaims by others that our products infringe their proprietary rights could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services and could increase our costs.\nSubstantial litigation over intellectual property rights exists in the professional and consumer diagnostics industries. Third-party infringement claims against us could increase as the number and functionality of our products grow and as we enter new and different industries and markets. Third parties may have or obtain patents which our products and services or technology may actually or allegedly infringe. Any of these third parties might assert infringement claims against us. Any litigation could result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management\u2019s time and resources. In addition, litigation in which we are accused of infringement may result in negative publicity, have an impact on current and prospective customers, cause product delays, or require us to develop alternative technologies, make substantial payments to third parties or enter into royalty or license agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Competitors may also have access to the licensed technology. If a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or license rights to the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, we may be forced to stop selling current products or abandon new products under development and we could be exposed to legal actions by our customers.\nWe may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive and, if we lose, could cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights, which would reduce our ability to compete.\nIn order to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation or other proceedings against, or enter into negotiations or settlement discussions with, third parties. Litigation may be necessary to:\n\u2022\nassert claims of infringement;\n\u2022\nenforce licensing terms and conditions;\n\u2022\nprotect our trade secrets or know-how; or\n\u2022\ndetermine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of ourselves or others.\nFrom time to time in the past we have initiated lawsuits and other claims against competitors whom we believed to have infringed our proprietary rights. Any lawsuits or claims that we initiate or assert could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Litigation can also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, any lawsuit or claim may provoke third parties to assert claims against us.\nIntellectual property law relating to the fields in which we operate is still evolving and, consequently, patent and other intellectual property positions in our industry are subject to change and often uncertain. We may not prevail in any lawsuit or other effort to protect our technology, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. During the course of\nany lawsuit, there may be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors perceive any of these results to be negative, the trading prices of our securities may decline.\nOur business could be adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures.\nSince our inception, we acquired numerous businesses. Our business strategy no longer focuses primarily on acquisitions, but we may acquire other businesses from time to time in the future. The ultimate success of our acquisitions depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating acquired businesses or assets into our existing businesses. However, the acquisition and successful integration of independent businesses or assets is a complex, costly and time-consuming process, and the benefits we realize may not exceed the costs of the acquisition. We have also disposed of certain businesses that we had previously acquired, including our health management business, our BBI business and Alere Accountable Care Solutions, LLC, or ACS. The risk and difficulties associated with acquiring and integrating companies and other assets include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe impact of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation, including the potential discovery of undisclosed or unanticipated liabilities or obligations;\n\u2022\nconsolidating manufacturing, research and development operations and quality systems, where appropriate;\n\u2022\nintegrating newly-acquired businesses or product lines into our financial reporting system;\n\u2022\ncoordinating sales, distribution and marketing functions and strategies;\n\u2022\nestablishing or expanding manufacturing, sales, distribution and marketing functions in order to accommodate newly-acquired businesses or product lines or rationalizing these functions to take advantage of synergies;\n\u2022\npreserving the important licensing, research and development, manufacturing and supply, distribution, marketing, customer and other relationships of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nminimizing the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential restructuring or other charges associated with the integration of operations;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate operations; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and legal issues relating to the integration of legacy and newly-acquired businesses.\nThese factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, and managing multiple acquisitions, investments or divestitures at the same time could exacerbate these risks. To the extent that we issue equity securities in connection with any acquisition or investment, existing shareholders may experience dilution. Our acquisitions have often provided for future contingent payments, or earn-outs, based on the achievement of performance targets or milestones, some of which are still outstanding. These arrangements can impact or restrict integration of acquired businesses and can result in disputes, including litigation. Additionally, regardless of the form of consideration we pay, acquisitions and investments could negatively impact our net income and earnings per share.\nSimilarly, in 2015, we divested ourselves of certain non-core assets, including the sales of our health management business and the BBI business. We intend to continue to divest certain non-core assets, but if we are unable to do so, our operations will continue to include those businesses, which may negatively impact our business and our results of operations.\nIf goodwill or other intangible assets that we have recorded in connection with our acquisitions of other businesses become impaired, we could have to take significant charges against earnings.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded, and may continue to record, a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. In 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $27.8 million related to certain intangible assets. Any further reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in additional charges against earnings, which could materially reduce our reported results of operations in future periods.\nOur business could be adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with divestitures.\nSince our inception, we have, from time to time, disposed of various assets or business units, including our BBI business in November 2015, our health management business in January 2015 and ACS in October 2014, and we may continue to pursue potential dispositions of other non-core assets. We may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or exit opportunities on advantageous terms and in a timely manner. If we are unable to dispose of any such assets, we may shut down the related operations, which could lead to additional expenses, accounting charges, write-offs and payments to resolve outstanding contractual obligations and other claims. Further, any disposition we do undertake may be subject to pre-closing conditions and approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Any consummated disposition may also have an adverse effect on our operations or financial results that is more significant than we expect.\nDivestitures may also involve continued financial obligations with respect to the divested assets or business, including through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations, any of which may be material. In some circumstances, some of our indemnification obligations in connection with divestitures may be unlimited in duration or amount. In addition, dispositions that provide for future contingent payments, or earn-outs, based on the achievement of performance targets or milestones can result in disputes, including litigation, and may not generate proceeds we expect to receive. The purchasers of our assets may also require that we agree not to compete with them in defined geographies or fields, which may limit our ability to conduct operations in the future, even if those operations would produce favorable results for our business.\nWe may be required under the agreements governing our indebtedness to obtain the consent of our lenders to certain dispositions or to apply all or a portion of the proceeds from a disposition to the repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If we make any future dispositions or enter into any alternative transactions, such as strategic alliances, joint ventures or other business combinations, we may be unable to structure them in a way that will enhance our creditworthiness, meet our strategic alternatives or otherwise be successful.\nWe do not have complete control over the operations of SPD, our 50/50 joint venture with P&G and our financial results may be negatively impacted by litigation to which SPD is party.\nBecause SPD is a 50/50 joint venture, we do not have complete control over its operations, including business decisions, which may impact SPD\u2019s profitability. As a joint venture, SPD involves special risks, as SPD or P&G may, at any time, have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests and may take actions that are detrimental to us.\nAdditionally, certain subsidiaries of P&G have the right, at any time upon certain material breaches by us or our subsidiaries of our obligations under the joint venture documents, to acquire all of our interest in SPD at fair market value less any applicable damages.\nAs previously disclosed, SPD is currently involved in civil litigation brought by a competitor in the United States with respect to the advertising of one of SPD\u2019s products in the United States. During 2015, SPD appealed the district court\u2019s injunction with respect to sales and advertising of such product, which was based on a finding that SPD violated certain laws with respect to the advertising of such product. The appellate court has issued a stay of the injunction, pending the outcome of the appeal. A ruling on the appeal is expected in the near future. In addition, a class action lawsuit has been initiated against SPD in United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging violations of certain laws in connection with the sales and advertising of one of SPD\u2019s products, which claims are based on similar grounds as those at issue in the litigation described above in this paragraph. SPD has moved to dismiss the class action lawsuit on the ground, among others, that the claims pleaded are preempted by federal law. A decision on the motion is expected shortly. In addition, there may be additional lawsuits against SPD or us relating to this matter in the future. The ultimate resolution of these matters is not known at this time, nor is the potential impact they may have on SPD or us, including whether any such resolution or any damages imposed by either court would have a material adverse impact on SPD and, ultimately, by virtue of our 50% interest in SPD, on our financial position or results of operations. The distributions we receive from SPD may decline in the future as a result of the outcomes of these matters, and we may be required to take reserves for potential liabilities arising from these actions (even if we are not a named party to lawsuits).\nOur business has substantial indebtedness.\nWe currently have, and will likely continue to have, a substantial amount of indebtedness. Our indebtedness could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, require us to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to repay and service our debt or otherwise create liquidity problems, limit our flexibility to adjust to market conditions, place us at a competitive disadvantage and expose us to interest rate fluctuations. As of June 30, 2016, we had total debt outstanding of $3.0 billion, which included $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facility, consisting of \u201cA\u201d term loans in the aggregate principal amount of $572.9 million and \u201cB\u201d term loans in the aggregate principal amount of $966.5 million (in addition, we have drawn $125 million under the revolving credit facility). Our secured credit facility has various final maturity dates occurring in 2020 and 2022. As of June 30, 2016, we also had $1.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our 7.25% senior notes, which mature in 2018, our 6.5% senior subordinated notes, which mature in 2020, and our 6.375% senior subordinated notes, which mature in 2023. If we are required to use our cash to satisfy any of our indebtedness, our liquidity will be negatively impacted, which could limit our ability to otherwise invest in our business through acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development investments and negatively impact our business in the future.\nWe expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from our operations, dispositions of non-core assets, and potentially from debt or equity offerings. Accordingly, our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance and capital-raising activities, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources prove inadequate to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, restructure or refinance our debt, which we may be unable to do on acceptable terms, and forego attractive business opportunities. In addition, the terms of our Merger Agreement with Abbott Laboratories and existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives without first obtaining consents, which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, including, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nacquire other businesses or make investments;\n\u2022\nraise additional capital;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or create liens on our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on our stock;\n\u2022\nrepurchase or redeem our stock or senior or subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nprepay indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndispose of assets; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese restrictions may limit or restrict our cash flow and our ability to pursue business opportunities or strategies that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests.\nOur secured credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain certain restrictive covenants that we may not satisfy, and that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of the amounts due under our secured credit facility and such indentures and the limitation of our ability to borrow additional funds in the future.\nThe agreements governing our secured credit facility subject us to various financial and other restrictive covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. The primary financial covenant under the secured credit facility is a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio. In addition, the indentures governing our 6.5% senior subordinated notes, our 6.375% senior subordinated notes and our 7.25% senior notes also contain restrictive covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. If we violate any of these covenants, we may suffer a material adverse effect. Most notably, our outstanding debt under our secured credit facility or our notes could become immediately due and payable, our lenders thereunder could proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness (in the case of our secured credit facility), and our ability to borrow additional funds in the future could be limited or terminated. Alternatively, we could be forced to refinance or renegotiate the terms and conditions of our secured credit facility, including the interest rates, financial and restrictive covenants and security requirements of the secured credit facility, on terms that may be significantly less favorable to us.\nWe were delayed in filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q in connection with the review of certain aspects of the timing of revenue recognition. In order to avoid events of default under our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our 7.25% senior notes, our 6.5% senior subordinated notes and our 6.375% senior subordinated notes, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement and obtained consents from the holders of such notes to permit an extension for filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q. We have not secured an extension of the deadline for filing of our First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q beyond, in the case of the Credit Agreement, August 18, 2016, or, in the case of the indentures governing our notes, August 31, 2016, and we could be required to seek another amendment or consents to such an extension, and we will likely be required to pay significant amounts in connection with such amendment or consents. If we were unable to timely file future annual reports or quarterly reports on time due to similar or other reasons and are unable to obtain an amendment or consent, we could be in default under these credit obligations, which could result in the acceleration of all amounts owing under our secured credit facility and our notes.\nA default under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in a default and acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement could result in a default and acceleration of our repayment obligations under other agreements. If a cross-default were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them. Even if new financing were available, it may not be available on acceptable terms. If some or all of our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and we may not have sufficient cash resources to pay all of such indebtedness when it becomes due as a result of a default.\nWe may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations upon a change of control, which could limit our opportunity to enter into a change of control transaction.\nIf we undergo a change of control, as provided in our secured credit facility, our 7.25% senior notes, our 6.5% senior subordinated notes or our 6.375% senior subordinated notes, we may be required to repay or repurchase some or all of such indebtedness. We may not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy all of our repayment and repurchase obligations. Our failure to satisfy our repayment and repurchase obligations would constitute a default under the relevant indentures and under our secured credit facility and could have material adverse consequences for us and our stakeholders.\nOur operating results may fluctuate for various reasons and, as a result, period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful.\nMany factors relating to our business, such as those described elsewhere in this section, make our future operating results uncertain and may cause them to fluctuate from period to period. Because our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indicator of our future performance. If revenue declines in a quarter, our results of operations will be harmed because many of our expenses are relatively fixed. In particular, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses are not significantly affected by variations in revenue. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, or fail to meet the guidance that we have previously provided to our investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and we may take certain income tax positions on our tax returns that tax authorities may disagree with. We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. However, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations to our global operations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, a dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities associated with our returns.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. There are several proposals to reform U.S. tax rules being considered by U.S. law makers, including proposals that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of U.S. income tax on our unrepatriated earnings, potentially requiring those earnings to be taxed at the U.S. federal income tax rate, reduce or eliminate our ability to claim foreign tax credits, and eliminate various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S. In addition, as part of its base erosion and profit shifting initiative, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, has begun to implement this initiative resulting in changes to the tax codes of its member states (and there may be additional changes in the future) that are\ndesigned to address perceived tax avoidance by multinational organizations. Our future reported financial results may be adversely affected by tax rule changes which restrict or eliminate our ability to claim foreign tax credits or deduct expenses attributable to foreign earnings, or otherwise affect the treatment of our unrepatriated earnings.\nThe election of a new president and the change in the administration in 2017 may result in significant changes to the regulation of healthcare and medical device industries and our business may be adversely impacted.\nA new presidential administration will take office in January 2017. Along with the change of administration, there are likely to be changes in the administration of federal regulatory agencies. Healthcare costs and regulations are likely to be an area of focus for any future administration. Any proposed changes in regulations, including regulations related to the cost of healthcare, use of medical devices, Medicare and Medicaid billing practices and the taxation of medical devices could have a material and adverse impact on our business. In addition, changes in philosophy and personnel at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may make it more difficult to introduce new products and continue the use of existing products and/or it may increase the costs and requirements of getting approvals for new products or modifying existing products. Such regulatory changes, or legislative changes, may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, impose additional requirements on product development efforts, make government and third-party reimbursement more difficult (and reductions in the amount of reimbursement), among others, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe may incur losses in excess of our insurance coverage.\nOur insurance coverage includes, among other policies, product liability, property, healthcare professional, directors and officers\u2019 liability and business interruption policies. Our insurance coverage contains policy limits, specifications and exclusions. We believe that our insurance coverage is consistent with general practices within our industry. Nonetheless, we may incur losses of a type for which we are not covered by insurance or which exceed the limits of liability of our insurance policies. In that event, we could experience a significant loss which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition.\nOur future success depends on our ability to recruit and retain key personnel.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain highly-qualified personnel, including our executive officers and scientific, technical, sales and marketing employees, and their ability to manage our operations successfully. Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. In addition, the loss of any of our key personnel, particularly key research and development personnel, could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research and development, operation or strategic objectives.\nFuture sales of our common stock, including shares issuable upon conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities in the public market could depress the price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. The price of our common stock could be affected by issuances of substantial numbers of shares of our common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock or by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock or other securities. If the conditions applicable to the conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock were satisfied, then subject to adjustment, each of the 1.8 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015 could convert into 5.7703 shares of our common\nstock, or a total of 10.2 million shares of our common stock. Upon certain extraordinary transactions, depending on the market price of our common stock at that time, the conversion rate could increase such that significantly more shares of common stock could be issued.\nThe holders of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive liquidation payments in preference to the holders of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock had an aggregate stated liquidation preference of $709.8 million. Dividends accrue on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a rate of 3% per annum, and we have the option to pay these dividends in cash or in shares of common stock or additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock. If we pay these dividends in shares of common stock or additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock or Series B Preferred Stock issued will be based upon market prices at the time of such payment. Upon a liquidation of our company, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a liquidation payment prior to the payment of any amount with respect to the shares of our common stock. The amount of this preferential liquidation payment is the aggregate stated liquidation preference plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Because of the substantial liquidation preference to which the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled, the amount available to be distributed to the holders of our common stock upon a liquidation of our company could be substantially limited or reduced to zero.\nThe terms of the Series B Preferred Stock may limit our ability to raise additional capital through subsequent issuances of preferred stock.\nFor so long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we are not permitted, without the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding, to authorize or designate any class or series of capital stock having rights on liquidation or as to distributions (including dividends) senior to the Series B Preferred Stock. This restriction could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.", "PERMNO": 89230, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ALR"}
