Risk Factors\nLike other companies in our industry, our financial results will be impacted by weather, the economy of our service territory, market prices for power, fuel prices, and the decisions of regulatory agencies. Our common stock price and creditworthiness will be affected by local, regional and national macroeconomic trends, general market conditions and the expectations of the investment community, all of which are largely beyond our control. In addition, the following statements highlight risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. These are not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all such risks, and the statements below must be read together with factors discussed elsewhere in this document and in our other filings with the SEC.\nOur Revenues and Profitability Depend upon Regulated Rates\nOur retail rates are subject to regulation by incorporated municipalities in Texas, the PUCT, the NMPRC and the FERC. The settlement approved in the Company's 2012 Texas rate case, PUCT Docket No. 40094, established the Company's current retail base rates in Texas, effective May 1, 2012. In addition, the settlement in the Company's 2009 New Mexico rate case, NMPRC Case No. 09-00171-UT, established rates in New Mexico that became effective on January 2010.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to recover the costs, including a reasonable return on invested capital, of providing electric service to our customers through base rates approved by our regulators. These rates are generally established based on an analysis of the expenses we incur in a historical test year, and as a result, the rates ultimately approved by our regulators may or may not match our expenses at any given time and recovery of expenses may lag behind the occurrence of those expenses. Rates in New Mexico may be established using projected costs and investment for a future test year period in certain instances. While rate regulation is based on the assumption that we will have a reasonable opportunity to recover our costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on our invested capital, there can be no assurance that our future Texas rate cases or New Mexico rate\ncases will result in base rates that will allow us to fully recover our costs including a reasonable return on invested capital. There can be no assurance that regulators will determine that all of our costs are reasonable and have been prudently incurred including costs associated with future plant retirement and asset retirement obligations. It is also likely that third parties will intervene in any rate cases and challenge whether our costs are reasonable and necessary. If all of our costs are not recovered through the retail base rates ultimately approved by our regulators, our profitability and cash flow could be adversely affected which, over time, could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations.\nWe May Not Be Able To Recover All Costs of New Generation and Transmission Assets\nIn 2013 and 2014, we received approval, both from the PUCT and the NMPRC, to construct four 88 MW simple-cycle aeroderivative combustion turbines at our Montana Power Station, a new plant site. During 2013, we completed the construction of Rio Grande Unit 9, an aeroderivative unit with a generating capacity of 87 MW, which reached commercial operation in May 2013. We have risk related to recovering all costs associated with the construction of Rio Grande Unit 9, the Montana Power Station, and other new units and transmission assets.\nIn 2014, we issued $150 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Senior Notes, due December 1, 2044. The net proceeds from the 5.00% Senior Notes along with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which was amended and restated on January 14, 2014, could help fund the construction of the Montana Power Station and other capital additions. The costs of financing and constructing these assets will be reviewed in future rate cases in both Texas and New Mexico. To the extent that the PUCT or the NMPRC determines that the costs of construction are not reasonable because of cost overruns, delays or other reasons, we may not be allowed to recover these costs from customers in base rates.\nIn addition, if these units are not completed on time, we may be required to purchase power or operate less efficient generating units to meet customer requirements. Any replacement purchased power or fuel costs will be subject to regulatory review by the PUCT and the NMPRC. We face financial risks to the extent that recovery is not allowed for any replacement fuel costs resulting from delays in the completion of these new units or other new units.\nWeakness in the Economy and Uncertainty in the Financial Markets Could Reduce Our Sales, Hinder Our Capital Programs and Increase Our Funding Obligations for Pensions and Decommissioning\nIn recent years, the global credit and equity markets and the overall economy have been through a state of turmoil. These and future events could have a number of effects on our operations and our capital programs. For example, tight credit and capital markets could make it difficult and more expensive to raise capital to fund our operations and capital programs. If we are unable to access the credit markets, we could be required to defer or eliminate important capital projects in the future. In addition, declines in the stock market performance may reduce the value of our financial assets and decommissioning trust investments. Such market results may also increase our funding obligations for our pension plans, other post-retirement benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trusts. Changes in the corporate interest rates which we use as the discount rate to determine our pension and other post-retirement liabilities may have an impact on our funding obligations for such plans and trusts. Further, continued economic volatility may result in reduced customer demand, both in the retail and wholesale markets, and increases in customer delinquencies and write-offs. Similarly, actions or inaction of Congress and of governmental agencies can impact our operations. For example, during 2013, sales to public authorities and small commercial and industrial customers were negatively impacted by the federal government sequestration and shutdown.The credit markets and overall economy may also adversely impact the financial health of our suppliers. If that were to occur, our access to and prices for inventory, supplies and capital equipment could be adversely affected. Our power trading counterparties could also be adversely impacted by the market and economic conditions which could result in reduced wholesale power sales or increased counterparty credit risk. Declines in revenues, earnings and cash flow from these events, could impact our ability to fund construction expenditures and impact the level of dividend payments. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of possible effects, and we may be adversely impacted in other ways.\nOur Costs Could Increase or We Could Experience Reduced Revenues if\nThere are Problems at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station\nA significant percentage of our generating capacity, off-system sales margins, assets and operating expenses is attributable to Palo Verde. Our 15.8% interest in each of the three Palo Verde units totals approximately 633 MW of generating capacity. Palo Verde represents approximately 34% of our available net generating capacity and provided approximately 47% of our energy requirements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Palo Verde comprises approximately 29% of our total net plant-in-service and Palo Verde expenses comprise a significant portion of operation and maintenance expenses. APS is the operating agent for Palo Verde, and we have limited ability under the ANPP Participation Agreement to influence operations and costs at\nPalo Verde. Palo Verde operated at a capacity factor of 93.7% and 91.1% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOur ability to increase retail base rates in Texas and New Mexico is limited. We cannot assure that revenues will be sufficient to recover any increased costs, including any increased costs in connection with Palo Verde or other operations, whether as a result of inflation, changes in tax laws, regulatory requirements, the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, or other causes.\nWe May Not Be Able to Recover All of Our Fuel Expenses from Customers On a Timely Basis Or at All\nIn general, by law, we are entitled to recover our reasonable and necessary fuel and purchased power expenses from our customers in Texas and New Mexico. NMPRC Case No. 13-00380-UT provides for energy delivered to New Mexico customers from the deregulated Palo Verde Unit 3 to be recovered through fuel and purchased power costs based upon a previous purchased power contract. Fuel and purchased power expenses in New Mexico and Texas are subject to reconciliation by the PUCT and NMPRC. Prior to the completion of a reconciliation, we record fuel and purchased power costs such that fuel revenues equal recoverable fuel and purchased power expense including the repriced energy costs for Palo Verde Unit 3 in New Mexico. In the event that recovery of fuel and purchased power expenses is denied in any reconciliation proceeding, the amounts recorded for fuel and purchased power expenses could differ from the amounts we are allowed to collect from our customers, and we would incur a loss to the extent of the disallowance.\nIn New Mexico, the FPPCAC allows us to reflect current fuel and purchased power expenses in the FPPCAC and to adjust for under-recoveries and over-recoveries with a two-month lag. In Texas, fuel costs are recovered through a fixed fuel factor. In Texas, we can seek to revise our fixed fuel factor based upon our approved formula at least four months after our last revision except in the month of December. If we materially under-recover fuel costs, we may seek a surcharge to recover those costs at any time the balance exceeds a threshold material amount and is expected to continue to be materially under-recovered. During periods of significant increases in natural gas prices, the Company realizes a lag in the ability to reflect increases in fuel costs in its fuel recovery mechanisms in Texas. As a result, cash flow is impacted due to the lag in payment of fuel costs and collection of fuel costs from customers. To the extent the fuel and purchased power recovery processes in Texas and New Mexico do not provide for the timely recovery of such costs, we could experience a material negative impact on our cash flow. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had a net under-collection balance of $9.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively.\nEquipment Failures and Other External Factors Can Adversely Affect Our Results\nThe generation and transmission of electricity require the use of expensive and complex equipment. While we have a maintenance program in place, generating plants are subject to unplanned outages because of equipment failure and severe weather conditions. The advanced age of several of our gas-fired generating units in or near El Paso increases the vulnerability of these units. In the event of unplanned outages, we must acquire power from others at unpredictable costs in order to supply our customers and comply with our contractual agreements. This additional purchased power cost would be subject to review and approval of the PUCT and the NMPRC in reconciliation proceedings. As noted above, in the event that recovery for fuel and purchased power expenses could differ from the amounts we are allowed to collect from our customers, we would incur a loss to the extent of the disallowance. This can materially increase our costs and prevent us from selling excess power at wholesale. In addition, actions of other utilities may adversely affect our ability to use transmission lines to deliver or import power, thus subjecting us to unexpected expenses or to the cost and uncertainty of public policy initiatives. Concerns over physical security and cyber security of transmission lines and generation facilities is also increasing, which may require us to incur additional capital and operating costs. Damage to certain transmission and generation facilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts, or damage due to severe weather could lead to outages or other adverse effects. We are particularly vulnerable to this because a significant portion of our available energy (at Palo Verde and Four Corners) is located hundreds of miles from El Paso and Las Cruces and must be delivered to our customers over long distance transmission lines. In addition, Palo Verde\u2019s availability is an important factor in realizing off-system sales margins. These factors, as well as interest rates, economic conditions, fuel prices and price volatility, are largely beyond our control, but may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and financial position.\nCompetition and Deregulation Could Result in a Loss of Customers and Increased Costs\nAs a result of changes in federal law, our wholesale and large retail customers already have access to, in varying degrees, alternative sources of power, including co-generation of electric power. Deregulation legislation is in effect in Texas requiring us to separate our transmission and distribution functions, which would remain regulated, from our power generation and energy services businesses, which would operate in a competitive market, in the future. In 2004, the PUCT approved a rule delaying retail competition in our Texas service territory. This rule was codified in the PURA in June 2011. The PURA identifies various milestones\nthat we must reach before retail competition can begin. The first milestone calls for the development, approval by the FERC, and commencement of independent operation of a regional transmission organization in the area that includes our service territory. This and other milestones are not likely to be achieved for a number of years, if they are achieved at all. There is substantial uncertainty about both the regulatory framework and market conditions that would exist if and when retail competition is implemented in our Texas service territory, and we may incur substantial preparatory, restructuring and other costs that may not ultimately be recoverable. There can be no assurance that deregulation would not adversely affect our future operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nFuture Costs of Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations Could\nAdversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results\nWe are or may become subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to discharges into the air, air quality, discharges of effluents into water, water quality, the use of water, the handling, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements, which change frequently and often become more restrictive, could require us to commit significant capital and operating resources toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of pollution control equipment and purchases of air emission allowances and/or offsets. These could also result in limitations in operating hours and/or changes in construction schedules for future generating units.\nCosts of compliance with environmental laws and regulations or fines or penalties resulting from non-compliance, if not recovered in our rates, could adversely affect our operations and/or financial results, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed, additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase. We cannot estimate our compliance costs or any possible fines or penalties with certainty, or the degree to which such costs might be recovered in our rates, due to our inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of environmental laws or regulations. For example, the EPA has issued in the recent past various proposed regulations regarding air emissions, such as the proposed revision of the existing primary and secondary ground-level ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. If these regulations become finalized and survive legal challenges, the cost to us to comply could adversely affect our operations and our financial results.\nClimate Change and Related Legislation and Regulatory Initiatives Could Affect Demand for\nElectricity or Availability of Resources, and Could Result in Increased Compliance Costs\nThe Company emits GHGs (including carbon dioxide) through the operation of its power plants. Federal legislation had been introduced in both houses of Congress to regulate the emission of GHGs and numerous states have adopted programs to stabilize or reduce GHG emissions. Additionally, the EPA is proceeding with regulation of GHG under the CAA. Under EPA regulations finalized in May 2010, formerly known as the \"Tailoring Rule\", the EPA can impose GHG best achievable control technology requirements for sources, including power plants already required to implement prevention of significant deterioration under the CAA for certain other pollutants .\nIn addition, in January 2014, the EPA published a proposal to establish new source performance standards limiting GHG emission from electric generating units on which construction commences after that date. Also, in June 2014, the EPA proposed carbon dioxide emissions standards for existing and reconstructed /modified power plants. EPA expects to issue final rules for carbon dioxide emissions from new, existing and reconstructed/modified power plants by summer 2015. The potential impact of these rules (if and when finalized) on the Company is unknown at this time, but they could result in significant costs, limitations on operating hours, and/or changes in construction schedules for future generating units.\nIt is not currently possible to predict how any pending, proposed or future GHG legislation by Congress, the states or multi-state regions or any GHG regulations adopted by the EPA or state environmental agencies will impact our business. However, any legislation or regulation of GHG emissions or any future related litigation could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or increased or reduced demand for our services, could require us to purchase rights to emit GHG, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation or results of operations.\nSecurity Breaches, Criminal Activity, Terrorist Attacks and Other Disruptions to Our Infrastructure Could Interfere With Our Operations, Could Expose Us or Our Customers or Employees to a Risk of Loss, and Could Expose Us to Liability, Regulatory Penalties, Reputational Damage and Other Harm to Our Business\nWe rely upon our infrastructure to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, supply chain functions, and the invoicing and collection of payments from our customers. We also use information technology systems for internal accounting purposes and to comply with financial reporting, legal and\ntax requirements. Our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, system failures, natural disasters, a physical attack on our facilities, or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could impact the reliability of our generation, transmission and distribution systems and energy marketing and trading functions; could expose us or our customers or employees to a risk of loss or misuse of information; and could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nAdditionally, we cannot predict the impact that any future information technology or terrorist attack may have on the energy industry in general. The effects of such attacks against us or others in the energy industry could increase the cost of regulatory compliance, increase the cost of insurance coverage or result in a decline in the U.S. economy which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. Ongoing and future governmental efforts to regulate cybersecurity in the energy industry could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs.\nThe Effects of Technological Advancement, Energy Conservation Measures and Distributed Generation Could Adversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results\nNew technologies may emerge that could be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes in a cost-effective manner and to offer, on a timely basis, services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards.\nAdditionally, the electric utility industry is undergoing other technological advances such as the expanded cost effective utilization of energy efficiency measures and distributed generation including solar rooftop projects. Customers\u2019 increased use of energy efficiency measures and distributed generation could result in lower demand. Reduced demand due to energy efficiency measures and the use of distributed generation, to the extent not substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 82855, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "EE"}
