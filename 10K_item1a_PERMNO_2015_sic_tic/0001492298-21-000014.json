{"cik": "1492298", "company": "Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following describes the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business/Operations\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread have negatively impacted us and our operations and are expected to continue to impact us and our operations in 2021 and potentially beyond, in a number of ways, including but not limited to:\n\u2022Decreased occupancy and increased operating costs for our tenants and borrowers, which have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, their ability to meet their obligations as they come due, including their obligation to make full and timely rental payments and debt service payments, respectively, to us. In some cases, we may have to restructure tenants\u2019 long-term rent obligations and may not be able to do so on terms that are as favorable to us as those currently in place. Reduced or modified rental and debt service amounts could result in the determination that the full amounts of our investments are not recoverable, which could result in an impairment charge.\n\u2022Decreased occupancy and increased operating costs within our Senior Housing - Managed portfolio and in our Enlivant Joint Venture, which have negatively impacted, and are expected to continue to negatively impact, the operating results of these investments. Prolonged deterioration in the operating results for these investments could result in the determination that the full amounts of our investments are not recoverable, which could result in an impairment charge.\nIf there are significant disruptions to our business, our credit ratings may be adversely impacted and we may breach covenants in our debt agreements and be unable to service our debt. Further, significant disruption could cause us to further reduce or suspend our dividend.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also caused, and is likely to continue to cause, severe economic, market and other disruptions worldwide. We cannot assure you that conditions in the bank lending, capital and other financial markets will not continue to deteriorate as a result of the pandemic, or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our tenants and operators may be subject to increased lawsuits filed by advocacy groups that monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities or by patients, facility residents or their families. Any litigation brought against our tenants and operators could increase our tenants\u2019 and operators\u2019 costs of business and could directly negatively impact our business. Further, we may be subject to increased claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and operators for which such tenants or operators may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. An unfavorable resolution of any such pending or future litigation could materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us in the event that we are not ultimately indemnified by our tenants or operators.\nIn addition, the deterioration of global economic conditions as a result of the pandemic may ultimately decrease occupancy levels and pricing across our portfolio as senior residents and tenants reduce or defer their spending. The extent of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak, the emergence of new strains of the virus, and the impact of vaccination efforts, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Due to the evolving nature of the ongoing pandemic, we are not able\nat this time to estimate the effect of these factors on our business, but the adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material.\nWe are dependent on the operating success of our tenants.\nOur tenants\u2019 revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and private pay rates. Revenues from government reimbursement have been, and may continue to be, subject to rate cuts and further pressure from federal and state budgetary cuts and constraints. A weakening of economic conditions in the U.S. may adversely affect occupancy rates of healthcare facilities that rely on private pay residents. Our tenants\u2019 expenses are driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. In addition, any failure by a tenant to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain residents in our properties. To the extent any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses results in our tenants\u2019 not generating enough cash to make scheduled lease payments to us, our business, financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur reported rental and related revenues may be subject to increased variability as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases, as amended by subsequent ASUs (\u201cTopic 842\u201d).\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Topic 842, which supersedes guidance related to accounting for leases and provides for the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous accounting guidance. The objective of Topic 842 is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. We elected to adopt Topic 842 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. Among other things, under Topic 842, if at any time we cannot determine that it is probable that substantially all rents over the life of a lease are collectible, rental revenue will be recognized only to the extent of payments received and all receivables associated with the lease will be written off, irrespective of amounts expected to be collectible. Recoveries of these amounts will be recorded in future periods upon receipt of payment. Under Topic 842, future write-offs of receivables and any recoveries of previously written-off receivables will be recorded as adjustments to rental revenue. As a result, the adoption of this new accounting standard could cause increased variability related to our reported rental and related revenues, which could increase the volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nWe are exposed to operational risks with respect to our Senior Housing - Managed communities.\nWe are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our Senior Housing - Managed communities that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. These risks are similar to the ones described above with respect to our tenants and include fluctuations in occupancy and private pay rates; economic conditions; competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage; state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; and the availability and increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise). Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nReal estate is a competitive business and this competition may make it difficult for us to identify and purchase suitable healthcare properties, to finance acquisitions on favorable terms, or to retain or attract tenants.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders and other investors, some of whom are significantly larger than us and have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do. This competition makes it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives. Similarly, our properties face competition for patients and residents from other properties in the same market, which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants or may reduce the rents we are able to charge. If we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare properties at favorable prices, finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, or attract and retain profitable tenants, our business, financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we lose our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.\nOur success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team, particularly Mr. Matros, our President and Chief Executive Officer. If we lose the services of Mr. Matros, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives.\nWe may experience uninsured or underinsured losses, which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property, decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expenses.\nWhile our lease agreements and property management agreements require that comprehensive insurance and hazard insurance be maintained by the tenants or operators, as applicable, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. Insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of a loss. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace properties after they have been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore the economic position with respect to a damaged property.\nRisks Related to Our Tenants and Operators\nOur tenants and operators may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement.\nOver the last several years, the regulatory environment of the long-term healthcare industry has intensified both in the amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. This is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers. The extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. Changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in a significant increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties.\nIf our tenants or operators fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. Our tenants and operators also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation, lawsuit or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. In such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants and operators and the results of operations of our properties operated by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. We are unable to predict future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur tenants and operators depend on reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payor programs, and reimbursement rates from such payors may be reduced.\nMany of our tenants and operators depend on third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid or private third-party payors, for the majority of their revenue. The reduction in reimbursement rates from third-party payors, including insurance companies and the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or other measures reducing reimbursements for services provided by our tenants and operators, may result in a reduction in our tenants\u2019 and operators\u2019 revenues and operating margins. In addition, reimbursement from private third-party payors may be reduced as a result of retroactive adjustment during claims settlement processes or as a result of post-payment audits. Furthermore, new laws and regulations could impose additional limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers. For example, our tenants and operators may be affected by health reform initiatives that modify certain payment systems to encourage more cost-effective care and a reduction of inefficiencies and waste (e.g., the implementation of a voluntary bundled payment program and the creation of accountable care organizations). We cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for the services provided by our tenants and operators. Although moderate reimbursement rate reductions may not affect our tenants\u2019 ability to meet their financial obligations to us, significant limits on reimbursement rates or on the services reimbursed could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position or results of operations, which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial obligations to us.\nWhile reimbursement rates have generally increased over the past few years, President Biden and members of the U.S. Congress may approve or propose new legislation, regulation changes and reform initiatives that could result in changes (including substantial reductions in funding) to Medicare, Medicaid or Medicare Advantage Plans. In addition, a number of states are currently managing budget deficits, which may put pressure on states to decrease reimbursement rates for our tenants and operators with a goal of decreasing state expenditures under their state Medicaid programs. Any such existing or future federal or state legislation relating to deficit reduction that reduces reimbursement payments to healthcare providers could have\na material adverse effect on our tenants\u2019 and operators\u2019 business, financial position or results of operations, which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe face potential adverse consequences of bankruptcy or insolvency by our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our tenants could become bankrupt or insolvent. Although our lease agreements provide us with the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. For example, a lessee may reject its lease with us in a bankruptcy proceeding. In such a case, our claim against the lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. This statutory cap could be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. In addition, a lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that its lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement. If such a claim is successful, our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, are generally more limited.\nWe may be unable to find a replacement tenant for one or more of our leased properties.\nWe may need to find a replacement tenant for one or more of our leased properties for a variety of reasons, including upon the expiration of the lease term or the occurrence of a tenant default. During any period in which we are attempting to locate one or more replacement tenants, there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments on the applicable property or properties. We cannot be sure that any of our current or future tenants will elect to renew their respective leases upon expiration of the terms thereof. Similarly, we cannot be sure that we will be able to locate a suitable replacement tenant or, if we are successful in locating a replacement tenant, that the rental payments from the new tenant would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments. Our ability to locate a suitable replacement tenant may be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership, certificate of need or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules. We also may incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. Any such delays, limitations and expenses could delay or impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for default, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential litigation and rising insurance costs may affect our tenants\u2019 and operators\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain adequate liability and other insurance and their ability to make lease payments and fulfill their insurance and indemnification obligations to us.\nOur tenants and operators may be subject to lawsuits filed by advocacy groups that monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities or by patients, facility residents or their families. Significant damage awards are possible in cases where neglect has been found. This litigation has increased our tenants\u2019 and operators\u2019 costs of monitoring and reporting quality of care and has resulted in increases in the cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance. These increased costs may materially adversely affect our tenants\u2019 and operators\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain adequate liability and other insurance; manage related risk exposures; fulfill their insurance, indemnification and other obligations to us under their leases or property management agreements, as applicable; or make lease payments to us, as applicable. In addition, from time to time, we may be subject to claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and operators for which such tenants or operators may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. An unfavorable resolution of any such pending or future litigation could materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us in the event that we are not ultimately indemnified by our tenants or operators.\nRegulatory Risks\nRequired regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare properties, which could result in periods in which we are unable to receive rent for such properties.\nOur tenants are operators of skilled nursing and other healthcare facilities, which operators must be licensed under applicable state law and, depending upon the type of facility, certified or approved as providers under the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Prior to the transfer of the operations of such healthcare properties to successor operators, the new operator generally must become licensed under state law and, in certain states, receive change-of-ownership approvals under certificate of need laws (which laws provide for a certification that the state has made a determination that a need exists for the beds located on the applicable property). If applicable, Medicare and Medicaid provider approvals may be needed as well. In the event that an existing lease is terminated or expires and a new tenant is found, then any delays in the new tenant receiving regulatory approvals from the applicable federal, state or local government agencies, or the inability of such tenant to receive\nsuch approvals, may prolong the period during which we are unable to collect the applicable rent. We could also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments.\nAs an owner of real property, we or our subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Although we do not currently operate or manage the substantial majority of our properties, we or our subsidiaries may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property where there has been a release or threatened release of a hazardous regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed an affected property\u2019s value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Further, some environmental laws provide for the creation of a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government as security for damages and any costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination and associated clean-up.\nAlthough we require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause, the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.\nInvestment and Financing Risks\nWe depend on investments in the healthcare property sector, making our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in that specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries.\nWe concentrate our investments in the healthcare property sector. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent to investments in a single industry, in real estate, and specifically in healthcare properties. A downturn or slowdown in the healthcare property sector would have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries. Specifically, a downturn in the healthcare property sector could negatively impact the ability of our tenants, operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us, as well as the ability to maintain rental and occupancy rates. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a downturn in the healthcare property sector could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties at prices or on terms acceptable to us.\nWe have substantial indebtedness and have the ability to incur significant additional indebtedness and other liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding indebtedness of $2.4 billion, which consisted of $1.3 billion of Senior Notes (as defined below), $1.1 billion in Term Loans (as defined below) and aggregate secured indebtedness to third parties of $80.2 million on certain of our properties, and we had $1.0 billion available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, the Enlivant Joint Venture had outstanding indebtedness of $776.6 million. Our high level of indebtedness may have the following important consequences to us:\n\u2022It may increase our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022It may limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022It may expose us to the risk of increased interest rates under debt instruments subject to variable rates of interest, such as our Revolving Credit Facility;\n\u2022It may adversely impact our credit ratings;\n\u2022It may limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and we may be vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate and/or healthcare sectors;\n\u2022It may place us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022It may restrict the way in which we conduct our business because of financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness;\n\u2022It may become more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations (including ongoing interest payments and, where applicable, scheduled amortization payments) with respect to the Senior Notes and our other debt; and\n\u2022It may require us to sell assets and properties at an inopportune time.\nIn addition, the Senior Notes Indentures (as defined below) permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt (to which the Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated). If we incur additional debt, the related risks described\nabove could intensify. Furthermore, the Senior Notes Indentures do not impose any limitation on our ability to incur liabilities that are not considered indebtedness under the Senior Notes Indentures.\nThe impact of any of these potential adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to service our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness depends on and is subject to our future financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets. Our business may fail to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings may be unavailable to us under our Revolving Credit Facility or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, to refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt. We may be unable to refinance any of our debt, including our Term Loans and any amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In particular, our Term Loans and our Revolving Credit Facility will mature prior to the maturity of the majority of the Senior Notes. If we were unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as asset sales, equity issuances and/or negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt. Our Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes Indentures restrict, and market or business conditions may limit, our ability to take some or all of these actions. Any restructuring or refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations.\nCovenants in our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 activities and could adversely affect our business.\nOur debt agreements, including the agreement governing our 2027 Notes (as defined below) and the Credit Agreement, contain various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to engage in various transactions including:\n\u2022Incurring additional secured and unsecured debt;\n\u2022Paying dividends or making other distributions on, redeeming or repurchasing capital stock;\n\u2022Entering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022Issuing stock of or interests in subsidiaries;\n\u2022Engaging in non-healthcare related business activities;\n\u2022Creating restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other amounts to us;\n\u2022Selling assets; or\n\u2022Effecting a consolidation or merger or selling substantially all of our assets.\nThe agreement governing our 2027 Notes also restricts us from making certain investments. The indentures governing our 2024 Notes, our 2026 Notes and our 2029 Notes (each as defined below) contain certain of the above restrictions as well. These covenants limit our operational flexibility and could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise, growing our business or competing effectively. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to comply with specified financial covenants, which include a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum tangible net worth ratio, as well as satisfy other financial condition tests. The indentures governing the 2024 Notes and 2029 Notes require us to comply with an unencumbered asset ratio, and the agreement governing our 2027 Notes requires us to comply with specified financial covenants, which include a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured debt leverage ratio, a maximum unsecured debt leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum net worth, a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio and a minimum unencumbered debt yield ratio. Our ability to meet these requirements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not meet these requirements.\nA breach of any of the covenants or other provisions in our debt agreements could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in such debt becoming immediately due and payable. Further, certain change in control events could result in an event of default under the agreement governing our 2027 Notes. Any of these events of default, in turn, could cause our other debt to become due and payable as a result of cross-acceleration provisions contained in the agreements governing such other debt. We may be unable to maintain compliance with these covenants and, if we fail to do so, we may be unable to obtain waivers from the lenders and holders and/or amend the covenants. In the event that some or all of our debt is accelerated and becomes immediately due and payable, we may not have the funds to repay, or the ability to refinance, such debt.\nAn increase in market interest rates could increase our interest costs on borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility and future debt and could adversely affect our stock price.\nIf interest rates increase, so could our interest costs for borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility and any new debt. This increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition more costly. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the access third parties have to credit, thereby decreasing the amount they are willing to pay for our assets, and consequently limit our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\nIn addition, increased inflation may have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness and our general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and phasing out of LIBOR beginning after 2021 may affect our financial results.\nOur Credit Agreement uses LIBOR as a reference rate for our U.S. dollar Term Loans and Revolving Credit Facility, such that the interest rate applicable to such loans may, at our option, be calculated based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR beginning after the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate, which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced. At this time, we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to LIBOR or the discontinuation of LIBOR. If LIBOR is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, although not expected, replacing LIBOR with an alternative reference rate for any of our debt (or other changes to our debt in connection with such replacement) could be a taxable event.\nOur ability to raise capital through equity financings is dependent, in part, on the market price of our common stock, which depends on market conditions and other factors affecting REITs generally.\nOur ability to raise capital through equity financings depends, in part, on the market price of our common stock, which in turn depends on fluctuating market conditions and other factors including the following:\n\u2022The reputation of REITs and attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison with other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies;\n\u2022Our financial performance and that of our tenants;\n\u2022Concentrations in our investment portfolio by tenant and property type;\n\u2022Concerns about our tenants\u2019 financial condition, including as a result of uncertainty regarding reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payor programs;\n\u2022Our ability to meet or exceed investor expectations of prospective investment and earnings targets;\n\u2022The contents of analyst reports about us and the REIT industry;\n\u2022Changes in interest rates on fixed-income securities, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher annual yield from investments in our common stock;\n\u2022Maintaining or increasing our dividend, which is determined by our board of directors and depends on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, debt covenants (which include limits on distributions by us), applicable law, and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant; and\n\u2022Regulatory action and changes in REIT tax laws.\nThe market value of a REIT\u2019s equity securities is generally based upon the market\u2019s perception of the REIT\u2019s growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash distributions. If we fail to meet the market\u2019s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions, the market price of our common stock could decline, and our ability to raise capital through equity financings could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur ownership of properties in Canada subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars. Although we have pursued hedging alternatives, by borrowing in Canadian dollar denominated debt and entering into cross currency swaps, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the failure to hedge effectively against foreign\ncurrency exchange rate risk could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, any income derived from such hedging transactions may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT.\nWe may not be able to sell properties when we desire because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nReal estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In addition, some and potentially substantially all of our properties serve as collateral for our current and future secured debt obligations and cannot readily be sold unless the underlying secured indebtedness is concurrently repaid. We may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in the real estate market. A downturn in the real estate market could materially adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell such properties for acceptable prices or on other acceptable terms. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property or portfolio of properties. These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with our 49% equity interest in the Enlivant Joint Venture.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our investment portfolio included 158 properties owned through the Enlivant Joint Venture. The Enlivant Joint Venture involves risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following:\n\u2022We may be unable to take specific major actions, or such actions may be delayed, if the counterparty to the Enlivant Joint Venture disagrees with such action, due to arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the Enlivant Joint Venture and any property owned by the Enlivant Joint Venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property;\n\u2022The counterparty to the Enlivant Joint Venture may take actions with which we disagree;\n\u2022Under our joint venture agreement for the Enlivant Joint Venture, the counterparty in the Enlivant Joint Venture has the right to transfer its 51% equity interest in the Enlivant Joint Venture, subject to our right of first offer, and also has the right to require us to sell our interest in the Enlivant Joint Venture in the same transaction pursuant to a drag-along obligation; in the event that the counterparty in the Enlivant Joint Venture wishes to transfer its interest, we would need to decide between acquiring the 51% equity interest at that time or potentially being required to sell some or all of our own 49% equity interest in a sale to a third party;\n\u2022Our ability to sell or transfer our interest in the Enlivant Joint Venture on advantageous terms when we so desire may be limited or restricted under the terms of our agreements with the counterparty in the Enlivant Joint Venture;\n\u2022We may be required to contribute additional capital if the counterparty in the Enlivant Joint Venture fails to fund its share of required capital contributions;\n\u2022Our equity interest in the Enlivant Joint Venture will be adversely impacted if the Enlivant Joint Venture is not able to maintain compliance with the terms of the agreements underlying its indebtedness, the outstanding balance of which indebtedness was $776.6 million as of December 31, 2020;\n\u2022The counterparty to the Enlivant Joint Venture might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, including with respect to the timing, terms and strategies for investment, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the properties owned by the Enlivant Joint Venture;\n\u2022Disagreements with the counterparty to the Enlivant Joint Venture could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors, and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the properties owned by the Enlivant Joint Venture, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and\n\u2022We may suffer losses to our investment in the Enlivant Joint Venture as a result of actions taken by the counterparty to the Enlivant Joint Venture.\nRisks Associated with Our Status as a REIT\nOur failure to maintain our qualification as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of our common stock and would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nOur qualification and taxation as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual annual operating results, certain qualification tests set forth in the U.S. federal tax laws. Accordingly, given the complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, including the potential tax treatment of\ninvestments we make, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that our actual results of operations for any particular taxable year will satisfy such requirements.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any calendar year, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income tax (and any applicable state and local tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income (although such dividends received by certain non-corporate U.S. taxpayers generally would currently be subject to a preferential rate of taxation). Further, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we might need to borrow money or sell assets in order to pay any resulting tax. Our payment of income tax would decrease the amount of our income available for distribution to our stockholders. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we no longer would be required under U.S. federal tax laws to distribute substantially all of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Unless our failure to qualify as a REIT was subject to relief under U.S. federal tax laws, we could not re-elect to qualify as a REIT until the fifth calendar year following the year in which we failed to qualify.\nThe 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions.\nTo comply with the 90% taxable income distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. The Senior Notes Indentures permit us to declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution that is necessary to maintain our REIT status if the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Indebtedness of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis at such time is less than 60% of Adjusted Total Assets (as each term is defined in the Senior Notes Indentures) and to make additional distributions if we pass certain other financial tests.\nWe are required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, and the Operating Partnership (as defined below) is required to make distributions to us to allow us to satisfy these REIT distribution requirements. However, distributions may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our properties or subsequently acquired properties to finance investments, acquisitions or new developments.\nAlthough we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. This may be due to the timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. Moreover, the 2017 Tax Act amends the Code such that income must be accrued for U.S. federal income tax purposes no later than when such income is taken into account as revenue in our financial statements, subject to certain exceptions, which could also create timing differences between net taxable income and the receipt of cash attributable to such income. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions also may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement.\nIn the event that such an insufficiency occurs, in order to meet the 90% distribution requirement and maintain our status as a REIT, we may have to sell assets at unfavorable prices, borrow at unfavorable terms, make taxable stock dividends, or pursue other strategies. This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations. The terms of our Credit Agreement and the terms of the Senior Notes Indentures may restrict our ability to engage in some of these transactions.\nWe could fail to qualify as a REIT if income we receive is not treated as qualifying income, including as a result of one or more of the lease agreements we have entered into or assumed not being characterized as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which would subject us to U.S. federal income tax at corporate tax rates.\nUnder applicable provisions of the Code, we will not be treated as a REIT unless we satisfy various requirements, including requirements relating to the sources of our gross income. Rents received or accrued by us will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if the lease agreements we have entered into or assumed (as well as any other leases we enter into or assume) are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are instead treated as service contracts, joint ventures, loans or some other type of arrangement. In the event that the lease agreements entered into with lessees are not characterized as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may fail to qualify as a REIT. In addition, rents received by us from a lessee will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if we are treated, either directly or under the applicable attribution rules, as owning 10% or more of the lessee\u2019s stock, capital or profits. We will be treated as owning, under the applicable attribution rules, 10% or more of a lessee\u2019s stock, capital or profits at any time that a stockholder owns, directly or under the applicable attribution rules, (a) 10% or more of our common stock and (b) 10% or more of the lessee\u2019s stock, capital or profits. The provisions of our charter restrict the transfer and ownership of our common stock that would cause the rents received or accrued by us from a tenant of ours to be treated as non-qualifying rent for\npurposes of the REIT gross income requirements. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that such restrictions will be effective in ensuring that we will not be treated as related to a tenant of ours. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable minimum tax for taxable years beginning before December 31, 2017) on our taxable income at corporate tax rates, which would decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to holders of our common stock.\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments, which could materially hinder our performance.\nTo qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy certain tests, including tests concerning the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego investments or acquisitions we might otherwise make. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may materially hinder our performance.\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes.\nA REIT\u2019s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors.\nIf we have significant amounts of non-cash taxable income, we may have to declare taxable stock dividends or make other non-cash distributions, which could cause our stockholders to incur tax liabilities in excess of cash received.\nWe currently intend to pay dividends in cash only, and not in-kind. However, if for any taxable year, we have significant amounts of taxable income in excess of available cash flow, we may have to declare dividends in-kind in order to satisfy the REIT annual distribution requirements. We may distribute a portion of our dividends in the form of our stock or our debt instruments. In either event, a holder of our common stock will be required to report dividend income as a result of such distributions even though we distributed no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such stockholder.\nThe IRS issued a Revenue Procedure treating certain distributions that are paid by an SEC-registered REIT partly in cash and partly in shares as dividends that would satisfy the REIT annual distribution requirement and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes so long as at least 20% of the total dividend is available in cash. However, if we make such a distribution, U.S. holders would be required to include the full amount of the dividend (i.e., the cash and stock portion) as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. holder may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received. If a U.S. holder sells our stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of the stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. holders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, these sales may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock. No assurance can be given that the IRS will not impose additional requirements in the future with respect to taxable dividends payable in cash and/or stock, including on a retroactive basis, or assert that the requirements for such taxable dividends have not been met.\nOur charter restricts the transfer and ownership of our stock, which may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares.\nIn order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code. For the purpose of preserving our REIT qualification, our charter prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, beneficial and constructive ownership of more than 9.9% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.9% in value of all classes or series of our outstanding stock. The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of stock owned directly or constructively by a group of related individuals to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. The ownership limits may have the effect of discouraging an acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors.\nWe may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax law could materially adversely affect our stockholders. In particular, the 2017 Tax Act significantly reforms the Code with respect to the taxation of both individuals and corporate entities (although certain changes will expire at the end of 2025) and the tax consequences of such changes as they apply to us and our stockholders may differ, in some cases materially, from the consequences under the laws in effect prior to January 1, 2018. In addition, the new presidential administration may propose changes to the tax law that could adversely impact us or our stockholders. We cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders may be changed.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\nThe maximum income tax rate applicable to \u201cqualified dividends\u201d payable by non-REIT corporations to domestic stockholders taxed at individual rates is currently 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. For taxable years after December 31, 2017 and continuing through 2025, the 2017 Tax Act temporarily reduces the maximum individual federal income tax rate from 39.6% to 37% and the effective tax rate on ordinary REIT dividends (i.e., dividends other than capital gain dividends and dividends attributable to certain qualified dividend income received by us) for U.S. holders of our common shares that are individuals, estates or trusts by permitting such holders to claim a deduction in determining their taxable income equal to 20% of any such dividends they receive. Although not adversely affecting the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are taxed at individual rates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends treated as qualified dividend income, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our common stock.\nOur ownership of and relationship with any taxable REIT subsidiaries that we have formed or will form will be limited and a failure to comply with the limits would jeopardize our REIT status and may result in the application of a 100% excise tax.\nA REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRSs\u201d). A TRS may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent REIT. Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS. A corporation (other than a REIT) of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns securities possessing more than 35% of the total voting power or total value of the outstanding securities of such corporation will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT\u2019s total assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. Under the 2017 Tax Act, such overall limitation on the value of a REIT\u2019s total assets consisting of stock or securities of one or more TRSs was reduced to 20%. A domestic TRS will pay U.S. federal, state and local income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns, but as a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act enacted in March 2020 (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of TRS losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 may be deducted only to the extent of 80% of TRS taxable income in the carryforward year (computed without regard to the NOL deduction). In contrast to prior law, which permitted unused NOL carryforwards to be carried back two years and forward 20 years, the 2017 Tax Act, as modified by the CARES Act, provides that losses arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2020 can no longer be carried back but can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, taxpayers, including TRSs, may be subject to a limitation on their ability to deduct net business interest generally equal to 30% of adjusted taxable income, subject to certain exceptions. However, the CARES Act generally increased the 30% limitation to a 50% limitation for any taxable year beginning in 2019 and 2020. This provision may limit the ability of our TRSs to deduct interest, which could increase their taxable income. The rules also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm\u2019s length basis. Any domestic TRS that we have formed or may form will pay U.S. federal, state and local income tax on its taxable income, and its after-tax net income will be available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed to us unless necessary to maintain our REIT qualification.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personal identifying information, tenant and lease data. We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential tenant, borrower and operator information, some of which may include individually identifiable information, including information relating to financial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the\nsecurity of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. Security breaches (including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, phishing attacks, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms, covert introduction of malware to computers and networks, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, bugs, security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by our team members or other insiders with access privileges, intentional acts of vandalism by third parties and sabotage) can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProvisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \u201cMGCL\u201d) and of our charter and bylaws could inhibit a change of control of Sabra or reduce the value of our stock.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law, our charter and our bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect. Sabra is subject to the Maryland business combination statute, which, subject to certain limitations, impose a moratorium on business combinations with \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d or affiliates thereof for five years and thereafter impose additional requirements on such business combinations. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the MGCL, which provide that holders of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of a corporation (defined as voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of issued and outstanding \u201ccontrol shares\u201d) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. There can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future. Additionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what currently is provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain takeover defenses, such as a classified board, some of which we do not have.\nWe have also adopted other measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our charter authorizing our board of directors (all without stockholder approval) to classify or reclassify shares of our stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock, and to amend our charter to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock that we have authority to issue. Our charter contains transfer and ownership restrictions on the percentage by number and value of outstanding shares of our stock that may be owned or acquired by any stockholder.\nOur bylaws require advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations. These provisions, as well as other provisions of our charter and bylaws, may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur bylaws provide that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland or the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between our company and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company or our directors, officers or other team members.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division, will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of any duty owed by any director or officer or other team member of our company to our company or to the stockholders of our company, (iii) any action asserting a claim against our company or any director or officer or other team member of our company arising pursuant to any provision of Maryland law, our charter or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against our company or any director or officer or other team member of our company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Maryland state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. This exclusive forum provision will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with our company or our directors, officers or other team members, which may discourage lawsuits against our company and our directors, officers and other team members. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Circuit\nCourt for Baltimore City, Maryland could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Maryland. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to our company than to our stockholders. However, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies\u2019 charters and bylaws has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find this type of provision to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 90092, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "SBRA"}
