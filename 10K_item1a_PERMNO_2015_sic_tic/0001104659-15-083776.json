RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company confronts. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to it or that it currently deems immaterial also may impair the Company\u2019s business operations and the implementation of the Plan. If any of the following risks actually occurs, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, net assets in liquidation and the implementation of the Plan could be materially adversely affected.\nUncertainties Inherent in the CDR Liability Calculation\nThe CDR liability is management\u2019s estimate of the amount of the remaining value of the Company to be shared by holders of CDRs at the sharing percentage of 37%. The net assets in liquidation which is used to calculate the CDR liability includes variables (e.g., estimated future operating costs and expenses, estimated future interest income, estimated other asset values, etc.) which are not under the control of the Company. Such variables are inherently uncertain due to the impact of influences such as time, inflation or deflation, interest rate changes, third party credit risks, domestic events, court or tax rulings contrary to the Company\u2019s expectations, timing and amounts of distributions to C-4 creditors by the Litigation Trust, and matters that could impact the timing on the wind down of the Company.\nImpact of Recoveries by Litigation Trust on the Company\u2019s Obligation to Make Payments in Respect of Contingent Distribution Rights\nAs the present value of distributions to certain C-4 creditors has reached the 100% threshold level of percentage recovery established pursuant to the Plan, holders of CDRs are entitled to receive payments from the Company equal to 37% of each dollar available to be distributed to Comdisco C-4 creditors in accordance with the Plan. All payments by the Company in respect of CDRs are made from the Company\u2019s available cash-on-hand and not from funds distributed by the Litigation Trust. The Company expects to maintain cash reserves sufficient to make any required payments pursuant to its CDR liability arising from either the Company\u2019s net assets in liquidation or any net distributions from the Litigation Trust to the C-4 creditors. Any actual net distributions by the Litigation Trust to the C-4 creditors will increase the Company\u2019s liability to CDR holders. Estimates of such net distributions are currently based on the likely anticipated distribution reported by the litigation trustee in its supplement to the final report filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and any such liability is reflected on the financial statements under Liabilities at Supplemental CDR Liability Due To Anticipated Litigation Trust Distribution.\nFinal Tax Clearances\nThe ability of the Company to effectuate timely assessments and receive final tax liabilities, if any, from the applicable state and federal taxing authorities to allow for the closure of the bankruptcy estate.\nUncertainties Inherent in the Determination of Value of the Ebates Escrow\nThe determination of the value of the Ebates escrow is management\u2019s estimate of such value at a moment in time based on information available to management at that time. The estimate of value is inherently uncertain due to factors that could impact the payout from the Ebates escrow. Some of the factors that could impact the timing and amount of the projections are claims and legal expenses assessed against the Ebates escrow.\nThe Payment of Dividends and Distributions\nAll funds generated from the Company\u2019s remaining assets are required by the Plan to be used to satisfy liabilities of the Company and, to the extent funds are available, to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s Common Stock and to make distributions with respect to the CDRs in the manner and priorities set forth in the Plan. Because of the composition and nature of its remaining assets, the Company expects to generate funds from the sale or run-off of its remaining assets at a decreasing rate over time. The Company has material restrictions on its ability, and does not expect or intend, to make any significant investments in new or additional assets. Accordingly, the amount of funds potentially available to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s Common Stock and to make distributions with respect to the CDRs is limited to the Company\u2019s Net Assets in Liquidation.\nUncertainties in Collections and Recoveries\nThe Company believes that its collections and recoveries on accounts previously written off could provide future but diminishing cash flows. The amount and timing of such collections and recoveries are dependent upon many factors including any offsets or counterclaims that may be asserted against the Company and the ability of a former lessee or debtor or its respective estate to pay the claim or any portion thereof. Some of these factors are beyond the control of the Company.\nUncertainties Relating to the Bankruptcy Plan and the Limited Business Plan and Impact of the Adoption of Liquidation Basis of Accounting\nThe Company believes the most critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies are the estimated future cash inflows and future outflows. As of October 1, 2014, the Company has adopted the liquidation basis of accounting on a prospective basis which requires the estimation of and accrual of all projected future cash inflows and future outflows associated with implementing and completing the plan of liquidation and requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated statements of net assets in liquidation and the related notes. Results could differ from these estimates and may affect the net assets in liquidation and actual cash flows. These estimates could be affected by the timing of the wind down of the estate, adverse tax ruling or changes, adverse court rulings and external events beyond the control of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s Liquidity is Dependent on Cash on Hand\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity depends on cash on hand.\nLimited Public Market for Common Stock\nThere is currently a limited public market for the Company\u2019s Common Stock. Holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock may, therefore, have difficulty selling their Common Stock, should they decide to do so. In addition, there can be no assurances that such markets will continue or that any shares of Common Stock which may be purchased could be sold without incurring a loss. Any such market price of the Common Stock may not necessarily bear any relationship to the Company\u2019s net assets in liquidation value or any other established criteria of value, and may not be indicative of the market price for the Common Stock in the future. Further, the market price of the Common Stock may be volatile depending on a number of factors, including the status of the Company\u2019s business performance, its limited business purpose, industry dynamics, news announcements or changes in general economic conditions.\nLimited Public Market for Contingent Distribution Rights\nThere is currently a limited public market for the Company\u2019s CDRs. Holders of the Company\u2019s CDRs may, therefore, have difficulty selling their CDRs, should they decide to do so. In addition, there can be no assurances that such markets will continue or that any CDRs which may be purchased could be sold without incurring a loss. Any such market price of the CDRs may not necessarily bear any relationship to the Company\u2019s net assets in liquidation value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value, and may not be indicative of the market price for the CDRs in the future. Further, the market price of the CDRs may be volatile\ndepending on a number of factors, including the status of the Company\u2019s business performance, industry dynamics, news announcements or changes in general economic conditions.\nUncertainties Relating to the Wind Down of Operations\nThe Company has reduced the size and complexity of its organizational and systems infrastructure concurrently with the monetization of its assets. The success of the Company\u2019s continuing wind down of operations and implementation of the Order entered by the Bankruptcy court authorizing the organizational systems infrastructure wind down is dependent upon the ability of the Company to effectively maintain its operations with limited personnel.\nThe Company is currently projecting December 31, 2016 as the end date for its wind down of operations. It is anticipated that by this date the Company will have, among other things: finalized the settlement of the SIP, received the projected escrow funds from the Ebates transaction, reduced all of its assets to cash, resolved its final federal and state tax obligations, determined its final CDR liability (which will include the impact of the actual distribution by the Litigation Trust to the C-4 creditors), made distributions of all available cash to holders of its common stock and CDRs in the manner and priorities set forth in the Plan, cancelled such common stock and CDRs and completed all regulatory filings. Accordingly, it has made appropriate expense accruals for such time period in its calculation of Net Assets in Liquidation. However, the projected remaining wind down period could be either shortened or lengthened by other intervening matters not currently known to management.\nImpact of Interest Rates\nChanges in interest rates could impact the value of certain of the Company\u2019s assets.", "PERMNO": 61524, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "CDCO"}
