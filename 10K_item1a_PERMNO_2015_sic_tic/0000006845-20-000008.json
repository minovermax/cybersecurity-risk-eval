Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, efforts to mitigate the pandemic, and the related weakening economic conditions, have impacted our business and could have a significant negative impact on our operations, liquidity, financial condition and financial results\nIn the last quarter of our fiscal 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, started to impact the global economic environment causing extreme volatility and uncertainty in global markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic and we started to see certain impacts to our business. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, and the related adverse public health developments, and government orders to \"stay in place\" have adversely affected\nwork forces, economies and financial markets globally. Quarantines and \"stay in place\" orders, the timing and length of containment and eradication solutions, travel restrictions, absenteeism by infected workers, labor shortages or other disruptions to our supply chain or our customers, will adversely impact our sales and operating results and has resulted in some project delays. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in an economic downturn that could affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing for projects and therefore impact demand for our products and services. Order lead times could be extended or delayed and our pricing or pricing of suppliers for needed materials could increase. Some critical materials, products or services may become unavailable if the regional or global spread were significant enough to prevent alternative sourcing. Accordingly, we are considering alternative product sourcing in the event that material supply becomes problematic.\nTo date, we have experienced some delays in commercial construction projects due to COVID-19. While the construction and construction-related industries are considered an \"essential service\" in most jurisdictions in which we operate, site closures or project delays have occurred and increased social distancing and health-related precautions are required on many work sites, which may cause additional project delays and additional costs to be incurred. Within the LSO segment, we also experienced the temporary closure of many of our customer's retail locations and we temporarily shut down our factories in this segment to comply with government \"stay in place\" orders. We expect this global pandemic to have an impact on our revenue and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. The global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate severity and spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing requirements in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nGiven the speed and frequency of continuously evolving developments with respect to this pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude of the impact to our results of operations, liquidity or financial position. To the extent that our customers and suppliers are adversely impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, this could reduce the availability, or result in delays, of materials or supplies, or delays in customer payments, which in turn could materially interrupt our business operations and/or impact our liquidity.\nGlobal instability and uncertainty arising from events outside of our control, such as significant natural disasters, political crises, public health crises and pandemics, and/or other catastrophic events\nNatural disasters, political crises, public health crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may damage our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, have broader adverse impacts on the commercial construction market, consumer confidence and spending, and/or impact the well-being of our employees and ability to operate our facilities. These types of disruptions or other events outside of our control could affect our business negatively, cause delays or cancellation of commercial construction projects or cause us to temporarily close our facilities, harming our operating results. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing, finishing or distribution facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, political crises, public health crises, and other catastrophic events or events outside of our control, our business and operating results could suffer.\nNorth American and global economic and industry-related business conditions\nOur Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments are dependent on North American economic conditions and the somewhat cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry. The commercial construction industry is impacted by macroeconomic trends such as availability of credit, employment levels, consumer confidence, interest rates and commodity prices. To the extent changes in these factors negatively impact the overall commercial construction industry, our revenue and profits could be significantly reduced.\nOur LSO segment primarily depends on the strength of the retail custom picture framing industry. This industry is highly dependent on consumer confidence and the conditions of the U.S. economy. A decline in consumer confidence, whether as a result of an economic slowdown (due to COVID-19 concerns discussed above or otherwise), uncertainty regarding the future or other factors, could result in a decrease in net sales and operating income of this segment.\nForeign currency impacts\nWhen the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, imports of products into the U.S. produced by international competitors become more price competitive and exports of our U.S.-fabricated products become less price competitive. If we are not able to counteract these types of price pressures through superior quality and service, our net sales and operating income could be negatively impacted. Additionally, our international subsidiaries report their results of operations and financial position in their relevant functional currencies (local country currency), which are then translated into U.S. dollars. As the relationship between these currencies and the U.S. dollar changes, there could be a negative impact on our reported results and financial position.\nNew competitors or specific actions of our existing competitors\nWe operate in competitive industries where the actions of our existing competitors or new competitors could result in loss of customers and/or market share. Changes in our competitors' products, prices or services could negatively impact our share of demand, net sales or margins.\nOur Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Glass segments have seen an increase in imports of products into the U.S. from international suppliers due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. If foreign imports occur at increased levels for extended periods of time, our net sales and margins could be negatively impacted.\nOur LSO segment competes with several international specialty glass manufacturers and international and domestic acrylic suppliers. If these competitors are able to successfully increase their product attributes, service capabilities and production capacity and/or increase their sales and marketing focus in the U.S. custom picture framing market, this segment's net sales and margins could be negatively impacted.\nAcquisitions and related integration activities\nWe have completed and may complete additional acquisitions in the future to accelerate the execution of our growth strategies, including new geographies, adjacent market sectors and new product introductions. There are risks inherent in completing acquisitions, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from existing business activities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings and synergies;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on relationships with existing customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nadverse impact on overall profitability if the acquired business does not achieve the return on investment projected at the time of acquisition; and\n\u2022\nwith respect to the acquired assets and liabilities, inaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition capital investments; undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities; problems executing backlog of material supply or installation projects; unanticipated costs; and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs.\nIf one or more of these risks were to arise in a material manner, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment\nOur assets include a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually at our year-end, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. The assessment of impairment requires determination of estimated fair value, generally using a discounted cash flow analysis, which involves significant judgment and projections about future performance.\nEvaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit in which goodwill is recorded using a qualitative or quantitative analysis. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis. Each of our nine business units represents a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment analysis. Based on our analysis, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, impairment was not indicated. However, the estimated fair value did not exceed carrying value by a significant margin for two of our reporting units within the Architectural Framing Systems segment, Sotawall and Alumicor, which had goodwill balances of $21.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively, at February 29, 2020. We utilized a discount rate of 9.4 percent in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis and a long-term growth rate of 3.0 percent. If our discount rate were to increase by 20 basis points, the fair value of these reporting units would fall below carrying value, which would indicate impairment of the goodwill. Additionally, this discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon achieving forecasted levels of revenue and profitability. If revenue or profitability were to fall below forecasted levels, or if market conditions were to decline in a material or sustained manner, impairment would be indicated at these reporting units, and potentially at our other reporting units. Subsequent to year-end, we have begun to see impacts from COVID-19 that will likely have a negative impact on our forecasted revenue and profitability and this, along with the decline in our stock price and other market conditions, could result in an indication of impairment of goodwill in our first quarter of 2021.\nFair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes the trade name or trademark has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the asset. This method requires estimation of the future revenue from the related asset, the appropriate royalty rate, and the weighted average cost of capital. Based on our analysis, the estimated fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, impairment was not indicated. In determining the discounted future revenue in our fair value\nanalysis, we assumed a discount rate of 9.4 percent, a royalty rate of 1.0 percent, and a long-term growth rate of 3.0 percent. If future revenue were to fall below forecasted levels or if market conditions were to decline in a material or sustained manner, due to COVID-19 or otherwise, we could incur a non-cash impairment charge that would negatively impact our net earnings for the fiscal period in which the charge was recorded.\nEffective utilization and management of our manufacturing capacity\nNear-term performance depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to provide sufficient available capacity and appropriately utilize existing production capacity. The failure to successfully maintain existing capacity, or manage unanticipated interruptions in production, successfully implement planned capacity expansions, and/or make timely investments in additional physical capacity and supporting technology systems could adversely affect our operating results.\nLoss of key personnel and inability to source sufficient labor\nOur success depends on the skills of the Company's leadership, construction project managers and other key technical personnel, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing and installation labor. In recent years, strong residential and commercial construction and low U.S. unemployment has caused increased competition for experienced construction project managers and other labor. If we are unable to retain existing employees, provide a safe and healthy working environment, and/or recruit and train additional employees with the requisite skills and experience, our operating results could be adversely impacted.\nSupply chain management, including availability and price of materials used in our products\nOur Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments use aluminum as a significant input to their products. While we structure many of our supply agreements in a way to moderate the effects of fluctuations in the market for raw aluminum and we endeavor to adjust our pricing to offset potential impacts, operating results could be negatively impacted by price movements in the market for raw aluminum. In recent years, we have seen increased volatility in the price of aluminum that we purchase from both domestic and international sources. Due to our Architectural Framing Systems segment presence in Canada, we have significant cross-border activity, as our Canadian businesses purchase inputs from U.S.-based suppliers and sell to U.S.-based customers. A significant change in U.S. trade policy with Canada could therefore have an adverse impact on our net sales and operating results.\nOur Architectural Glass and LSO segments use raw glass as a significant input to their products. We periodically experience a tighter supply of raw glass when there is growth in automotive manufacturing and residential and non-residential construction. Although we have secured supply commitments from multiple suppliers that allow us to reach our near-term growth targets, a significant unplanned downtime or shift in strategy at one or more of our key suppliers could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses, including recent impacts from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs or availability of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, the potential impact of COVID-19 could adversely impact our suppliers and result in our inability to purchase needed materials in a timely manner or to achieve our targeted procurement cost reductions.\nIf we encounter problems with distribution, our ability to deliver our products to market could be adversely affected. Our operations are vulnerable to interruptions in the event of work stoppages, whether due to health concerns such as COVID-19 or otherwise, labor disputes or shortages and natural disasters that may affect our distribution and transportation to job sites. Moreover, our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to data and system security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer and consumer expectations, manage inventory, manage transportation-related costs, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be adversely affected.\nProduct quality issues\nWe manufacture and/or install a significant portion of our products based on the specific requirements of each customer. We believe that future orders of our products or services will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability and quality standards required by our customers. If our products have performance, reliability or quality problems, or products are installed using incompatible glazing materials or installed improperly (by us or a customer), we may experience additional warranty expense; reduced or canceled orders; higher manufacturing or installation costs; or delays in the collection of accounts receivable. Additionally, performance, reliability or quality claims from our customers could result in costly and time-consuming litigation\nthat could require significant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that could negatively impact our operating results.\nProject management and installation issues\nSome of our segments are awarded fixed-price contracts that include material supply and installation services. Often, bids are required before all aspects of a construction project are known. An underestimate in the amount of labor required and/or cost of materials for a project; a change in the timing of the delivery of product; system design errors; difficulties or errors in execution; or significant project delays, caused by us or other trades, could result in failure to achieve the expected results. Any one or more of such issues could result in losses on individual contracts that could negatively impact our operating results.\nSpecifically, we have a large construction project that is nearing completion but continues to experience certain project delays that have resulted in significant additional costs and ongoing negotiations with our customer. These and any further delays or project difficulties could have additional negative impact on our operating results.\nCustomer dependence in the LSO segment\nThe LSO segment is highly dependent on a relatively small number of customers for its sales, while working to grow in new markets and with new customers. Accordingly, loss of a significant customer, a significant reduction in pricing, or a shift to a less favorable mix of value-added picture framing glass or acrylic products for one or more of those customers could materially reduce LSO net sales and operating results. Recently, many customers in this segment temporarily closed retail outlets as a result of \"stay in place\" orders within the United States, resulting in reduced demand for our product. In response to this changing retail environment, the LSO segment has temporarily reduced production and labor, and furloughed employees. We expect this situation to result in a significant reduction in sales in our first quarter of fiscal 2021, however, we are unable to estimate the severity or longer-term impact resulting from this COVID-19 pandemic on our business in this segment. If demand continues to remain depressed, it could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of this segment.\nResults can differ significantly from our expectations and the expectations of analysts\nOur sales and earnings guidance and resulting external analyst estimates are largely based on our view of our business and the broader commercial construction market. Further, there is additional risk in our ability to accurately forecast and provide guidance in the current environment, given the rapidly evolving conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Failure to meet our guidance or analyst expectations for net sales and earnings would have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nSignificant risk retention through self-insurance programs\nWe obtain third-party insurance to provide coverage for potential risk in areas such as employment practices, workers' compensation, directors and officers, automobile, architect's and engineer's errors and omissions, product rework and general liability, as well as medical insurance and various other coverages. However, a high amount of risk is retained on a self-insured basis, partially through our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Therefore, a material architectural product liability event could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nDependence on information technology systems and potential security threats\nOur operations are dependent upon various information technology systems that are used to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support our manufacturing operations and a variety of other business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in maintaining our existing systems, and developing and implementing new systems. Such difficulties could lead to disruption in business operations and/or significant additional expenses that could adversely affect our results.\nAdditionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data and product specifications, production downtimes, disruption in the availability of financial data, or misrepresentation of information via digital media. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, regulatory action, project delay claims, and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection systems.", "PERMNO": 14526, "SIC": 3442, "TIC": "APOG"}
