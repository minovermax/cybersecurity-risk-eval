RISK FACTORS.\nThe occurrence of any of the events described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other of our filings with the SEC could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In evaluating an investment in any of our securities, you should consider carefully, among other things, the factors and the specific risks set forth below. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.\nThe price volatility of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products and fuel and utility services may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, profitability and cash flows.\nOur refining and marketing earnings, profitability and cash flows from operations depend primarily on the margin between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. When the margin between refined product prices and crude oil and other feedstock prices contracts, as has been the case in recent periods and may be the case in the future, our results of operations and cash flows are negatively affected. Refining margins historically have been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile as a result of a variety of factors including fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products and fuel and utility services. The direction and timing of changes in prices for crude oil and refined products do not necessarily correlate with one another and it is the relationship between such prices that has the greatest impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nPrices of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined products, and the relationships between such prices and prices for refined products, depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, other feedstocks, gasoline, diesel, asphalt and other refined products and the relative magnitude and timing of such changes. Such supply and demand are affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the underlying demand for our products;\n\u2022\nthe availability, costs and price volatility of crude oil, other refinery feedstocks and refined products;\n\u2022\nworldwide political conditions, particularly in significant oil producing regions such as the Middle East, West Africa and Latin America;\n\u2022\nthe level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products and the volume of crude oil, feedstock and refined products imported in the United States;\n\u2022\nrefinery utilization rates;\n\u2022\ninfrastructure limitations;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to affect oil prices and maintain production controls;\n\u2022\nthe actions of customers and competitors;\n\u2022\ndisruptions due to equipment interruption, pipeline disruptions or failure at our or third-party facilities and other factors affecting transportation infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe effects of transactions involving forward contracts and derivative instruments and general commodities speculation;\n\u2022\nthe execution of planned capital projects, including the build out of additional pipeline infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe effects and costs of compliance with current and future federal, state and local environmental, economic, safety and other laws, policies and regulations;\n\u2022\noperating hazards, natural disasters, casualty losses and other matters beyond our control;\n\u2022\nthe impact of global economic conditions on our business; and\n\u2022\nthe development and marketing of alternative and competing fuels.\nAlthough we continually analyze refinery operating margins at each of our refineries and seek to adjust throughput volumes and product slates to optimize our operating results based on market conditions, there are inherent limitations on our ability to offset the effects of adverse market conditions. For example, reductions in throughput volumes in a negative operating margin environment may reduce operating losses, but it would not eliminate them because we would still be incurring fixed costs and certain levels of variable costs.\nThe nature of our business has historically required us to maintain substantial quantities of crude oil and refined product inventories. Because crude oil and refined products are commodities, we have no control over the changing market value of these inventories. Our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value under the last-in, first-out (\u201cLIFO\u201d) inventory valuation methodology. As a result, if the market value of our inventory were to decline to an amount less than our LIFO cost, we would record a write-down of inventory and a non-cash charge to cost of sales. Our investment in inventory is affected by the general level of crude oil prices, and significant increases in crude oil prices could result in substantial working capital requirements to maintain inventory volumes. Changes in the value of our inventory or increases in the amount of our working capital necessary to maintain our inventory volumes could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, profitability and cash flows.\nIn addition, the volatility in costs of natural gas, electricity and other utility services used by our refineries and other operations affect our operating costs. Utility prices have been, and will continue to be, affected by factors outside our control, such as supply and demand for utility services in both local and regional markets. Future increases in utility prices may have a negative effect on our earnings, profitability and cash flows.\nOur profitability depends, in part, on the differential between the cost of crude oils processed by our refineries and those processed by our competitors. Changes in this differential could negatively affect our profitability.\nWe select grades of crude oil to process based, in part, on each individual refinery\u2019s configuration and operating units. Our profitability is partially derived from our ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that are less expensive than those processed by competing refiners. We quantify this differential in crude prices by comparing our crude acquisition price with benchmark crude oil grades such as West Texas Intermediate. Crude oil differentials can vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions, trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined products, and infrastructure constraints. An adverse change in these differentials affecting one or more of our refineries could have a negative impact on our earnings.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur level of indebtedness could have significant effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows and, consequently, important consequences to your investment in our securities, such as:\n\u2022\nwe may be limited in our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements or our other operational needs;\n\u2022\nwe may be limited in our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt;\n\u2022\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less leverage since we may be less capable of responding to adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nwe may not have sufficient flexibility to react to adverse changes in the economy, our business or the industries in which we operate.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic and market conditions and financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditure, debt service and other liquidity needs, which could result in our inability to comply with financial and other covenants contained in our debt agreements, our being unable to repay or pay interest on our indebtedness, and our inability to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to service our debt obligations, fund our other liquidity needs and maintain compliance with our financial and other covenants, we could be forced to curtail our operations, our creditors could accelerate our indebtedness and exercise other remedies and we could be required to pursue one or more\nalternative strategies, such as selling assets or refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness. However, we cannot assure you that any such alternatives would be feasible or prove adequate.\nThe dangers inherent in our operations could cause disruptions and could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in refining operations and in transporting and storing crude oil, intermediate products and refined products. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, fires, explosions, pipeline ruptures and spills, waterborne transportation accidents, third-party interference and mechanical failure of equipment at our or third-party facilities, any of which could result in production and distribution difficulties and disruptions, environmental pollution, personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to our properties and the properties of others. The occurrence of such events at any of our refineries could significantly disrupt our production and distribution of refined products, and any sustained disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to interruptions of supply and distribution as a result of our reliance on pipelines and barges for transportation of crude oil and refined products.\nOur refineries receive a substantial percentage of their crude oil and deliver a substantial percentage of their refined products through pipelines and barges. We could experience an interruption of supply or delivery, or an increased cost of receiving crude oil and delivering refined products to market, if the ability of these pipelines and barges to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of accidents, earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, governmental regulation, terrorism, or other third party action. Our prolonged inability to use any of the pipelines or barges that we use to transport crude oil or refined products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the price of crude oil increases significantly, it could reduce our margin on our fixed-price asphalt supply contracts.\nWe enter into fixed-price asphalt supply contracts pursuant to which we agree to deliver asphalt to customers at future dates. We set the pricing terms in these agreements based, in part, upon the price of crude oil at the time we enter into each contract. If the price of crude oil increases from the time we enter into the contract to the time we produce the asphalt, our margins from these sales could be adversely affected.\nOur operating results are seasonal and generally lower in the first and fourth quarters of the year.\nDemand for gasoline and asphalt products is generally higher during summer months than during winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and road construction work. Seasonal fluctuations in highway traffic also affect motor fuels and merchandise sales in our retail stores. As a result, our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters. This seasonality is most pronounced in our asphalt business. The effects of seasonal demand for gasoline are partially offset by seasonality in demand for diesel, which in our region is generally higher in winter months as east-west trucking traffic moves south to avoid winter conditions on northern routes.\nChanges in our credit profile could affect our relationships with our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to operate our refineries at full capacity.\nChanges in our credit profile could affect the way crude oil suppliers view our ability to make payments and induce them to shorten the payment terms for our purchases or require us to post security prior to payment. Due to the large dollar amounts and volume of our crude oil and other feedstock purchases, any imposition by our suppliers of more burdensome payment terms on us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to our suppliers. This, in turn, could cause us to be unable to operate our refinery at full capacity. A failure to operate our refinery at full capacity could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows. Alternatively, these more burdensome payment terms may require us to incur additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, which could increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flows.\nOur arrangements with J. Aron expose us to J. Aron related credit and performance risk.\nWe have supply and offtake agreements with J. Aron, who is our largest supplier of crude oil and largest customer of refined products from our refineries. In the future, we could purchase up to 100% of our supply needs at each of our refineries from J. Aron pursuant to this agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to repurchase all consigned inventories and certain other inventories upon termination of this agreement, which may be terminated by J. Aron as early as May 31, 2018. Relying on J. Aron\u2019s ability to honor its fuel requirements purchase obligations exposes us to J. Aron\u2019s credit and business risks. An adverse change in J. Aron\u2019s business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition could adversely affect its ability to\nperform its obligations, which could consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, we may be required to use substantial capital to repurchase inventories from J. Aron upon termination of the agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nCompetition in the refining and marketing industry is intense, and an increase in competition in the markets in which we sell our products could adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\nWe compete with a broad range of companies in our refining and marketing operations. Many of these competitors are integrated, multinational oil companies that are substantially larger than we are. Because of their diversity, integration of operations, larger capitalization, larger and more complex refineries and greater resources, these companies may be better able to withstand disruptions in operations and volatile market conditions, to offer more competitive pricing during times of intense price fluctuations and to obtain crude oil in times of shortage.\nWe are not engaged in the exploration and production business and therefore do not produce any of our crude oil or other feedstocks. Certain of our competitors, however, obtain a portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production. Competitors that have their own crude production are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from oil producing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. In addition, we compete with other industries, such as wind, solar and hydropower that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual customers. If we are unable to compete effectively with these competitors, both within and outside our industry, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition in the asphalt industry is intense and an increase in competition in the markets in which we sell our asphalt products could adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\nOur asphalt business competes with other refiners and with regional and national asphalt marketing companies. Many of these competitors are larger, more diverse companies with greater resources, providing them advantages in obtaining crude oil and other blendstocks and in competing through bidding processes for asphalt supply contracts.\nWe compete in large part on our ability to deliver specialized asphalt products which we produce under proprietary technology licenses. Recently, demand for these specialized products has increased due to new specification requirements by state and federal governments. If we were to lose our rights under our technology licenses, or if competing technologies for specialized products are developed by our competitors, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nCompetition in the retail industry is intense, and an increase in competition in the markets in which our retail businesses operate could adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\nOur retail operations compete with numerous convenience stores, gasoline service stations, supermarket chains, drug stores, fast food operations and other retail outlets. Increasingly, national high-volume grocery and dry-goods retailers, such as Albertson\u2019s and Wal-Mart are entering the gasoline retailing business. Many of these competitors are substantially larger than we are. Because of their diversity, integration of operations and greater resources, these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability. In addition, these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the pump and in the store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales. These activities by our competitors could adversely affect our profit margins. Additionally, our convenience stores could lose market share, relating to both gasoline and merchandise, to these and other retailers, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. Our convenience stores compete in large part based on their ability to offer convenience to customers. Consequently, changes in traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing stores could result in the loss of customers and reduced sales and profitability at affected stores.\nWe may incur significant costs to comply with new or changing environmental laws and regulations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulatory controls on air emissions, water discharges, waste management and the clean-up of contamination that can require costly compliance measures. If we fail to comply with environmental requirements, we may be subject to administrative, civil and criminal proceedings by state and federal authorities, as well as civil proceedings by non-governmental environmental groups and other individuals, which could result in substantial fines and penalties against us as well as governmental or court orders that could alter, limit or suspend our operations.\nIn October 2006, we were contacted by Region 6 of the EPA and invited to enter into discussions under the EPA\u2019s National Petroleum Refinery Initiative (the \u201cInitiative\u201d). This Initiative is a coordinated, integrated compliance and enforcement strategy to address federal Clean Air Act compliance issues at the nation\u2019s largest petroleum refineries, including compliance with New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements, New Source Performance Standards, Leak Detection and Repair requirements, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Benzene Waste Operations. According\nto the EPA, as of January 2015, approximately 90% of the nation\u2019s refining capacity is under lodged or entered \u201cglobal\u201d settlements. In February 2007, we committed in writing to enter into discussions with the EPA regarding our Big Spring refinery and, since that time, have held negotiations with the agency with respect to entering into a global settlement under the Initiative. Based on our on-going negotiations as well as consideration of prior settlements that the EPA has reached with other petroleum refineries under the Initiative, we believe that we would be required to pay a civil penalty, install air pollution controls, and enhance certain operations and maintenance programs in consideration for a broad release from liability. At this time, while we cannot estimate the cost of any such civil penalties, pollution controls or environmentally beneficial projects, the civil penalties will likely exceed $100,000, and the remaining costs could be significant and collectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn 2010, our Big Spring refinery was one of more than 100 facilities in Texas to receive a Clean Air Act request for information from the EPA relating to the EPA\u2019s disapproval of Texas\u2019 \u201cflexible permit program.\u201d According to the EPA, the Texas flexible permit program and its implementing rules were never approved by the EPA for inclusion in the Texas state clean-air implementation plan and, therefore, emission limitations in Texas flexible permits are not federally enforceable. The EPA indicated that it would consider enforcement against holders of flexible permits that failed to comply with applicable federal requirements on a case-by-case basis. We had agreed to convert the Big Spring refinery\u2019s non-flexible permit to a federally enforceable non-flexible permit and submitted a permit application for that purpose, which remains pending. In August 2012, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the EPA\u2019s final rule disapproving Texas\u2019 flexible permit program and remanded the program back to the EPA for further consideration. Following the Fifth Circuit decision, Texas submitted a state clean-air implementation plan, including the flexible permit provisions, to the EPA for reconsideration in accordance with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision. In July 2014, the EPA published its approval of Texas\u2019 flexible permit program, conditioned on a commitment from Texas to adopt certain minor clarifications to the flexible permit program by November 30, 2014. Texas timely adopted the required minor clarifications and submitted the revised program to the EPA for approval. On December 31, 2014, the EPA issued a proposed rule converting the EPA\u2019s previous conditional approval of Texas\u2019 program to a full approval. We are presently assessing our Big Spring refinery\u2019s air emissions permitting alternatives as a result of these developments.\nIn addition, new laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement or other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. For example, in March 2014, the EPA announced final new \u201cTier 3\u201d motor vehicle emission and fuel standards. Under the final rule, gasoline must contain no more than 10 ppm sulfur on an annual average basis beginning as early as January 1, 2017; however, approved small volume refineries have until January 1, 2020 to meet the standard. We believe that the Big Spring, Krotz Springs, Paramount, and Bakersfield refineries each satisfy the definition of a small volume refinery, and we have applied to the EPA for status as small volume refineries for each of these facilities as is required by the Tier 3 regulations. We estimate that the capital investment associated with upgrades necessary to meet these new required sulfur levels will be less than $30 million. We are not able to predict the impact of other new or changed laws or regulations or changes in the ways that such laws or regulations are administered, interpreted or enforced but we may incur increased operating costs and capital expenditures to comply, which could be material. To the extent that the costs associated with meeting any of these requirements are substantial and not adequately provided for, our results of operations and cash flows could suffer.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and a reduced demand for our refining services.\nIn December 2009 the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on its findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act including rules that require a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another rule that established GHG emissions thresholds that determine when certain stationary sources must obtain construction or operating permits under the Clean Air Act. In cases where a new source is constructed or an existing major source undergoes a major modification, facilities may be required to reduce those emissions according to \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards for GHGs. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, including petroleum refineries, on an annual basis, for emissions occurring after January 1, 2010.\nIn addition, the federal Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and a number of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or monitoring and\nreporting requirements, or result in reduced demand for refined petroleum products we produce. One or more of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities with respect to environmental lawsuits and proceedings and any investigation and remediation of existing and future environmental conditions.\nWe are currently investigating and remediating, in some cases pursuant to government orders, soil and groundwater contamination at our refineries, terminals and convenience stores. We anticipate spending $7.2 million in investigation and remediation expenses over the next 15 years in connection with historical soil and groundwater contamination at our Big Spring refinery and the Abilene, Southlake and Wichita Falls terminals, which we formerly owned and operated. We anticipate spending an additional $37.4 million in investigation and remediation expenses in connection with our California refineries and terminals over the next 15 years. There can be no assurances, however, that we will not have to spend more than these anticipated amounts. Our handling and storage of petroleum and hazardous substances may lead to additional contamination at our facilities and facilities to which we send or sent wastes or by-products for treatment or disposal, in which case we may be subject to additional cleanup costs, governmental penalties, and third-party suits alleging personal injury and property damage. Joint and several strict liability may be incurred in connection with such releases of petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and/or wastes. Although we have sold two of our pipelines pursuant to a transaction with Sunoco, we have agreed, subject to certain limitations, to indemnify Sunoco for costs and liabilities that may be incurred by Sunoco as a result of environmental conditions existing at the time of the sale. If we are forced to incur costs or pay liabilities in connection with such releases and contamination or any associated third-party proceedings and investigations, or in connection with any of our indemnification obligations to Sunoco, such costs and payments could be significant and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations or otherwise comply with worker health and safety, environmental and other laws and regulations.\nFrom time to time, we have been sued or investigated for alleged violations of worker health and safety, environmental and other laws. If a lawsuit or enforcement proceeding were commenced or resolved against us, we could incur significant costs and liabilities. In addition, our operations require numerous permits and authorizations under environmental and various other laws and regulations. These authorizations and permits are subject to revocation, renewal or modification and can require operational changes to limit impacts or potential impacts on the environment and/or worker health and safety. A violation of authorization or permit conditions or of other legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations, injunctions, and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, major modifications of our operations could require modifications to our existing permits or upgrades to our existing pollution control equipment. Any or all of these matters could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nRenewable fuels mandates may reduce demand for the petroleum fuels we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe EPA has issued RFS mandates, requiring refiners such as us to blend renewable fuels into the petroleum fuels they produce and sell in the United States. To the extent refiners will not or cannot blend renewable fuels in the products they produce in the quantities required to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program, those refiners must purchase RINs to maintain compliance. Under the RFS program, the volume of renewable fuels that obligated parties are required to blend into their finished petroleum fuels increases annually over time until 2022. As a result of receiving hardship relief made available to obligated parties meeting certain criteria, our Big Spring refinery first became subject to the RFS program in 2013 and the Krotz Springs refinery first became subject to the program in 2014. RINs costs for the Big Spring refinery were $6.7 million and $14.9 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. RINs costs for the Krotz Springs refinery were $21.4 million for 2014, although we are still considering whether to seek hardship relief from the EPA for 2014. The Big Spring refinery through its wholesale sales is able to blend finished products with renewable fuels, thus generating RINs. Conversely, the Krotz Springs refinery sells substantially all of its finished products which are subject to the RFS program, via the Colonial pipeline, which does not allow us to blend products; and therefore must purchase RINs to satisfy its obligation. The EPA has published the proposed volume mandates for 2014, which are generally lower than the volumes for 2013 and lower than the statutory mandates. The EPA submitted a draft final rule for regulatory review by the federal Office of Management and Budget on August 21, 2014. In January 2015, the EPA announced that its goal was to release the final 2014 RFS volume mandates in the Spring of 2015. The price of RINs has been extremely volatile and has increased over the last year. We cannot currently predict the future prices of RINs and, thus, the expenses related to RINs compliance have the potential to be material. Existing laws\nand regulations could change, and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum fuels may increase. Because we do not produce renewable fuels, increasing the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into our products displaces an increasing volume of our refineries\u2019 product pool, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe could encounter significant opposition to operations at our California refineries.\nOur Paramount refinery is located in a residential area. The refinery is located near schools, apartment complexes, private homes and shopping establishments. In addition, our Long Beach refinery is located in close proximity to other commercial facilities, and our Bakersfield refinery is adjacent to newly developed commercial and retail property. Any loss of community support for our California refining operations could result in higher than expected expenses in connection with opposing any community action to restrict or terminate the operation of the refinery. Any community action in opposition to our current and planned use of the California refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe occurrence of a release of hazardous materials or a catastrophic event affecting our California refineries could endanger persons living nearby.\nBecause our California refineries are located in residential areas, any release of hazardous material or catastrophic event could cause injuries to persons outside the confines of these refineries. In the event that persons were injured as a result of such an event, we would likely incur substantial legal costs as well as any costs resulting from settlements or adjudication of claims from such injured persons. The extent of these expenses and costs could be in excess of the limits provided by our insurance policies. As a result, any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our facilities are located in areas that have a history of earthquakes or hurricanes, the occurrence of which could materially impact our operations.\nOur refineries located in California and the related pipeline and asphalt terminals are located in areas with a history of earthquakes, some of which have been quite severe. Our Krotz Springs refinery is located less than 100 miles from the Gulf Coast. In the event of an earthquake or hurricane or other weather-related event that causes damage to our refining, pipeline or asphalt terminal assets, or the infrastructure necessary for the operation of these assets, such as the availability of usable roads, electricity, water, or natural gas, we may experience a significant interruption in our refining and/or marketing operations. Such an interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nTerrorist attacks, threats of war or actual war may negatively affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks, threats of war or actual war, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations. Energy-related assets (which could include refineries, terminals and pipelines such as ours) may be at greater risk of terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the United States. A direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any terrorist attack, threats of war or actual war could have an adverse impact on energy prices, including prices for our crude oil and refined products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government-imposed price controls.\nCovenants in our credit agreements could limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions and adversely affect our liquidity.\nOur credit agreements contain negative and financial covenants and events of default that may limit our financial flexibility and ability to undertake certain types of transactions. For example, we are subject to negative covenants that restrict our activities, including changes in control of Alon or certain of our subsidiaries, restrictions on creating liens, engaging in mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, incurring additional indebtedness, entering into certain lease obligations, making certain capital expenditures, and making certain dividend, debt and other restricted payments. Should we desire to undertake a transaction that is prohibited or limited by our credit agreements, we will need to obtain the consent of our lenders or refinance our credit facilities. Such consents or refinancings may not be possible or may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs or liabilities that we may experience.\nWe maintain significant insurance coverage, but it does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities. Our property insurance policies that cover our refineries and asphalt assets have a $950 million limit. Claims for physical damage at our refineries and asphalt assets are subject to a $10 million deductible. The business interruption insurance policies that cover our Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries have a $550 million limit and are subject to a 45-day waiting period. At all of our facilities, including the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries, we are fully exposed to all losses in excess of the applicable limits and sub-limits, a $10 million deductible due to property damage and for losses due to business interruptions of fewer than 45 days.\nWe maintain third party liability insurance policies that cover third party claims with a $300 million limit subject to a $5 million deductible. We are fully exposed to third party claims in excess of the applicable limit and sub-limits and a $5 million deductible.\nAdditionally, we could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or insurable events in amounts in excess of our existing insurance coverage or which are not covered by that insurance. Our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which we have no control. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we lose any of our key personnel, our ability to manage our business and continue our growth could be negatively affected.\nOur future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and key technical personnel. We do not currently maintain key man life insurance with respect to any member of our senior management team. The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key technical employee could significantly harm us. We face competition for these professionals from our competitors, our customers and other companies operating in our industry. To the extent that the services of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel would be unavailable to us for any reason, we would be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our company and to develop our products and technology. We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nA substantial portion of our Big Spring refinery\u2019s workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 200 people at our Big Spring refinery, approximately 135 of whom were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The collective bargaining agreement expires on April 1, 2015. Our current labor agreement may not prevent a strike or work stoppage in the future, and any such work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nWe conduct our convenience store business under a license agreement with 7-Eleven, and the loss of this license could adversely affect the results of operations of our retail segment.\nOur convenience store operations are primarily conducted under the 7-Eleven name pursuant to a license agreement between 7-Eleven, Inc. and us. 7-Eleven may terminate the agreement if we default on our obligations under the agreement. This termination would result in our convenience stores losing the use of the 7-Eleven brand name, the accompanying 7-Eleven advertising and certain other brand names and products used exclusively by 7-Eleven. Termination of the license agreement could have a material adverse effect on our retail operations.\nWe depend upon our subsidiaries for cash to meet our obligations and pay any dividends, and we do not own 100% of the stock of our operating subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations or pay dividends to our stockholders depend upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by our subsidiaries to us in the form of dividends, tax sharing payments or otherwise. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make any payments will depend on their earnings, cash flows, the terms of their indebtedness, tax considerations and legal restrictions. Two of our current and former executive officers, Messrs. Morris and Hart, are parties to stockholders\u2019 agreements with Alon Assets and us, pursuant to which we may elect or be required to purchase their shares in connection with put/call rights or rights of first refusal contained in those agreements. The purchase price for the shares is generally determined pursuant to certain formulas set forth in the stockholders\u2019 agreements, the purchase price under certain circumstances involving a termination of, or resignation from, employment would be the fair market value of the shares. For additional information, see Item 12 \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Holders and Management and\nRelated Stockholder Matters.\u201d Additionally, we own 81.6% of the Partnership\u2019s common units and 100% of Alon USA Partners GP, LLC, the general partner of the Partnership. To the extent the Partnership is unable to make distributions to its partners, we may be unable to pay any dividends.\nThe wholesale fuel distribution industry is characterized by intense competition and fragmentation and our failure to effectively compete could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe market for distribution of wholesale motor fuel is highly competitive and fragmented. We have numerous competitors, some of which have significantly greater resources and name recognition than us. We rely on our ability to provide reliable supply and value-added services and to control our operating costs in order to maintain our margins and competitive position. If we were to fail to maintain the quality of our services, customers could choose alternative distribution sources and our competitive position could be adversely affected. Furthermore, we compete against major oil companies with integrated marketing businesses. Through their greater resources and access to crude oil, these companies may be better able to compete on the basis of price or offer lower wholesale and retail pricing which could negatively affect our fuel margins. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCommodity derivative contracts may limit our potential gains, exacerbate potential losses, result in period-to-period earnings volatility and involve other risks.\nWe may enter into commodity derivatives contracts intended to mitigate our crack spread risk. We enter into these arrangements with the intent to secure a minimum fixed cash flow stream on the volume of products hedged during the hedge term. However, our hedging arrangements may fail to fully achieve these objectives for a variety of reasons, including our failure to have adequate hedging contracts, if any, in effect at any particular time and the failure of our hedging arrangements to produce the anticipated results. We may not be able to procure adequate hedging arrangements due to a variety of factors. Moreover, while intended to reduce the adverse effects of fluctuations in crude oil and refined product prices, such transactions may limit our ability to benefit from favorable changes in margins. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022\nthe volumes of our actual use of crude oil or production of the applicable refined products is less than the volumes subject to the hedging arrangement;\n\u2022\naccidents, interruptions in feedstock transportation, inclement weather or other events cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries, or those of our suppliers or customers;\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or\n\u2022\na sudden, unexpected event materially impacts the commodity or crack spread subject to the hedging arrangement.\nAs a result, the effectiveness of our risk mitigation strategy could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nThe adoption of regulations implementing recent financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices.\nThe U.S. Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). This comprehensive financial reform legislation establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d), the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. The CFTC has proposed regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or derivative instruments would be exempt from these position limits. As these proposed position limit rules are not yet final, the effect of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require compliance with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with certain derivative activities, although the application of those provisions to us, and the impact of such provisions on us, is uncertain at this time. The legislation may also require certain counterparties to our commodity derivative contracts to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty, or cause the entity to comply with the capital requirements, which could result in increased costs to counterparties such as us. The final rules will be phased in over time according to a specified schedule which is dependent on finalization of certain other rules to be promulgated by the CFTC and the SEC.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of some commodity derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the\nterms of some commodity derivative contracts, reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing commodity derivative contracts and potentially increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors. Finally, the Dodd- Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. If the Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations result in lower commodity prices, our operating income could be adversely affected. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties subject to such foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nIt may be difficult to serve process on or enforce a United States judgment against certain of our directors.\nAll of our directors, other than Messrs. Ron Haddock and Jeff Morris, reside in Israel. In addition, a substantial portion of the assets of these directors are located outside of the United States. As a result, you may have difficulty serving legal process within the United States upon any of these persons. You may also have difficulty enforcing, both in and outside the United States, judgments you may obtain in United States courts against these persons in any action, including actions based upon the civil liability provisions of United States federal or state securities laws. Furthermore, there is substantial doubt that the courts of the State of Israel would enter judgments in original actions brought in those courts predicated on United States federal or state securities laws.", "PERMNO": 90779, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "ALJ"}
