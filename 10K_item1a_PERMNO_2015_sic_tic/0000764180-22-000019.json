{"cik": "764180", "company": "ALTRIA GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our results of operations, our cash flows, our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10-K.\nWe may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the SEC, reports to security holders, press releases and investor webcasts and presentations. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201ccontinues,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cgoals,\u201d \u201cobjectives,\u201d \u201cguidance,\u201d \u201ctargets\u201d and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans, estimates and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in Altria\u2019s securities. In connection with the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this Form 10-K particularly in the \u201cBusiness Environment\u201d sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries\u2019 businesses below in Item 7. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law.\nRisks Related to Litigation, Legislative or Regulatory Action\nUnfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees and Altria\u2019s ability to achieve its Vision.\nLegal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and its subsidiaries, including PM USA, as well as their respective indemnitees, indemnitors and Altria\u2019s investees. Various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, unfair trade practices, antitrust, tax, contraband-related claims, patent infringement, employment matters, claims alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), claims for contribution and claims of competitors, shareholders and distributors. Legislative action, such as changes to tort law, also may expand the types of claims and remedies available to plaintiffs.\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. Damages claimed in some tobacco-related or other litigation are significant and, in certain cases, have ranged in the billions\nof dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome.\nIn certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants\u2019 liability is joint and several. In such cases, Altria or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment. As a result, Altria or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts. Furthermore, in those cases where plaintiffs are successful, Altria or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nAlthough PM USA has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases. This risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and Puerto Rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all. As discussed in Note 18, tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of Florida\u2019s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well. Such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court. Although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.\nIn certain litigation, Altria, its subsidiaries and its investees may face potentially significant non-monetary remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. For example, in the Federal Government\u2019s lawsuit discussed in Note 18, the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant non-monetary remedies, including the issuance of \u201ccorrective statements.\u201d In the patent lawsuit adjudicated before the ITC discussed in Note 18, the ITC banned the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and component parts into the United States and the sale and marketing of any such products previously imported into the United States. As a result of the ITC\u2019s decision, PM USA removed the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and any infringing components from the marketplace.\nIn 2019, we determined that our investment in JUUL was impaired in part due to the increase in the number and type of legal cases pending against JUUL. Altria and PM USA are also defendants in many of these cases. In addition, in April 2020 the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) issued an administrative complaint against Altria and JUUL alleging that Altria\u2019s 35% investment in JUUL and the associated agreements constitute unreasonable restraint on trade. In February 2022, the administrative law judge dismissed the FTC\u2019s complaint. FTC complaint counsel appealed that decision to the FTC Commissioners. E-vapor litigation and the FTC action, including the remedies the FTC is seeking, are further discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K (\u201cItem 3\u201d) and Note 18.\nAltria and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation. Nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty, and significant challenges remain.\nIt is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in certain pending litigation could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision. Altria and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. Each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges. However, Altria and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of Altria to do so. See Item 3, Note 18 and Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Form 10-K for a discussion of pending tobacco-related litigation.\nSignificant federal, state and local governmental actions, including actions by the FDA, and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on Altria and its tobacco operating companies\u2019 or its investees\u2019 businesses and sales volumes and on Altria\u2019s ability to achieve its Vision.\nAs described in Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7, PM USA faces significant governmental and private sector actions, including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold PM USA responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. These actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume, and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels.\nMore broadly, actions by the FDA and other federal, state or local governments or agencies, including those specific actions described in Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7, may (i) impact the adult tobacco consumer acceptability of or access to tobacco products (for example, through nicotine or constituent limits or menthol or other flavor bans), (ii) delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk, (iii) limit adult tobacco consumer choices, (iv) require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace (for example as a result of (a) product contamination, (b) legislation and rulemaking that bans menthol or other flavors, (c) a determination by the FDA that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence, (d) because the FDA requires that a currently marketed tobacco product proceed\nthrough the pre-market review process or (e) because the FDA does not authorize a PMTA or otherwise determines that removal is necessary for the protection of public health), (v) restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers, (vi) restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products, (vii) create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies, (viii) impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packing requirements, (ix) interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business, (x) result in increased illicit trade in tobacco products or (xi) restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments. Any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting Altria\u2019s investment in JUUL and Altria\u2019s ability to achieve its Vision. See Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7 for a more detailed discussion.\nTobacco products are subject to substantial taxation, which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of Altria\u2019s tobacco operating companies and JUUL and on Altria\u2019s ability to achieve its Vision.\nTobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes, and significant increases in tobacco product-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the United States at the federal, state and local levels. The frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors, including federal and state budgets and the composition of executive and legislative bodies. Tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco operating companies and JUUL through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult tobacco consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments or to other low-priced or low-taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products. Such shifts may also have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of Altria\u2019s tobacco operating companies. In addition, excise taxes on e-vapor and oral nicotine products may negatively impact adult smokers\u2019 transition to these products, which could adversely affect Altria\u2019s ability to achieve its Vision. For further discussion, see Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Excise Taxes in Item 7.\nUnfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of Altria and its subsidiaries or its investees and Altria\u2019s ability to achieve its Vision.\nFrom time to time, Altria, its subsidiaries and its investees are subject to federal and state governmental investigations on a range of matters. For further discussion of current pending investigations, see Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity in Item 7. We cannot predict the outcome of any such investigation, and it is possible that our business or the businesses of our subsidiaries and investees and our ability to achieve our Vision could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of any current or future investigation.\nA challenge to our tax positions, an increase in the income tax rate or other changes to federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow.\nTax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations. A successful challenge to one or more of Altria\u2019s tax positions (which could give rise to additional liabilities, including interest and potential penalties), an increase in the corporate income tax rate or other changes to federal or state tax laws, including changes to how foreign investments are taxed, could adversely affect Altria\u2019s earnings or cash flow.\nInternational business operations subject Altria, its subsidiaries and its investees to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and/or significant costs.\nWhile Altria and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the United States, they do engage (directly or indirectly) in certain international business activities that are subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, such as foreign privacy laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption. Although we have a Code of Conduct for Compliance and Integrity and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law, no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees, investees or third parties. Altria\u2019s investees also engage in international business operations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, by Altria, its subsidiaries or its investees could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and/or significant costs.\nRisks Related to Business Operations\nAltria, its subsidiaries and its investees face various risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and similar outbreaks, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies and investees.\nAltria\u2019s, its subsidiaries\u2019 and its investees\u2019 business and financial results, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be negatively impacted by health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks. The continuing COVID-19 pandemic could have negative impacts, such as (i) a global or U.S. recession or other economic crisis, including a financial crisis, (ii) credit and capital markets volatility (and limited access to these markets, including by those in the distribution and supply chains), (iii) significant volatility in demand for our tobacco operating companies\u2019 and investees\u2019 products, (iv) changes in adult tobacco consumer accessibility to those products, including due to government action, (v) changes in adult tobacco consumer behavior and preferences, including trading down to lower-priced products or the reduction in, or the cessation of, product use due to public health actions or concerns and\neconomic conditions (including those stemming from potential changes in government stimulus or reductions in unemployment payments or other benefits), and (vi) extended or multiple disruptions in our tobacco operating companies\u2019 or investees\u2019 manufacturing operations, or in their distribution and supply chains. In addition, our subsidiaries and investees may incur increased costs and otherwise be negatively affected if significant portions of their respective workforces (or the workforces within their respective distribution or supply chains) are unable to work or work effectively, including because of illness, unavailability of personal protective equipment, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the outbreak (including new variants), increases in the number of cases in future periods, and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate the public health effects. We cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our or our investees\u2019 future financial or operational results, but the impact could be material over time. See the risks below related to extended disruptions at a facility, of a distributor or in service by a service provider and the risks related to our investments in JUUL, ABI and Cronos and the earnings from and carrying value of those investments. For further discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our tobacco operating companies and investees, see Executive Summary - COVID-19 Pandemic in Item 7.\nAltria\u2019s tobacco businesses face significant competition (including across categories) and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of Altria, or the business of Altria\u2019s tobacco operating companies and on Altria\u2019s ability to achieve its Vision.\nEach of Altria\u2019s tobacco operating companies operates in highly competitive tobacco categories. This competition also exists across categories as adult tobacco consumer preferences evolve. Significant methods of competition include product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging, distribution and promotional activities. This highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability, market share (including as a result of down-trading to lower-priced competitive brands) and shipment volume of Altria\u2019s tobacco operating companies, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of Altria. See Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Summary in Item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences. Growth of the e-vapor product category and other innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, has further contributed to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and in the consumption levels and sales volumes of other tobacco products, including MST. In addition, growth of unregulated synthetic nicotine products, which may not be subject to the same regulatory restrictions (including marketing restrictions and FDA pre-marketing requirements) as the tobacco-derived e-vapor and oral nicotine products of Altria\u2019s tobacco operating companies and JUUL, could negatively impact the growth of e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products. Continued growth in these categories could have a material adverse impact on the business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies if they are unable to compete effectively (directly or through Altria\u2019s investments) in these innovative product categories, which could also negatively impact Altria\u2019s ability to achieve its Vision.\nPM USA also faces competition from lower-priced brands sold by certain United States and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the United States and, as such, are not required to make annual settlement payments as required by the parties to the settlements. These settlement payments are significant for PM USA, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation in Item 7. These settlements, among other factors, resulted in substantial cigarette price increases to help cover the cost of the settlement payments. Manufacturers not party to the settlements are subject to state escrow legislation requiring escrow deposits. Such manufacturers may avoid these escrow obligations by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers\u2019 cigarettes sold in such states. Additional competition has resulted from diversion into the United States market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the United States, the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes, and imports of foreign lower-priced brands.\nAltria and its tobacco operating companies may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences, responding to changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Altria or the business of Altria\u2019s tobacco operating companies.\nEach of our tobacco operating companies is subject to intense competition and changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences. To be successful, they must continue to:\n\u25aapromote brand equity successfully;\n\u25aaanticipate and respond to new and evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences;\n\u25aadevelop, manufacture, market and distribute new and innovative products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers (including, where appropriate, through arrangements with, or investments in, third parties);\n\u25aaimprove productivity; and\n\u25aaprotect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases.\nSee Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Summary in Item 7 and the immediately preceding risk factor for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, specifically the growth of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products and the effects on our tobacco operating companies.\nThe willingness of adult tobacco consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions, including inflation. In periods of economic uncertainty and/or high inflation, among other conditions, adult tobacco consumers may purchase more discount brands and/or, in the case of tobacco products, consider lower-priced tobacco products, including different categories of tobacco products than those they traditionally purchase, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies. While our tobacco operating companies work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lower-priced products, the failure to do so could negatively impact their ability to compete in these circumstances. During the second half of 2021, discount cigarette products resumed share growth driven primarily by deep discount products. See Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Summary in Item 7 for further discussion of economic conditions, including the impact of the current high inflationary environment on our businesses.\nAltria\u2019s tobacco operating companies and investees may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing innovative products or processes, including tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with certain other tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers, which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams and/or put them at a competitive disadvantage and may also have an adverse effect on Altria\u2019s ability to achieve its Vision.\nAltria and its tobacco operating companies have growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into innovative products or processes. Some innovative tobacco products may reduce the health risks associated with certain other tobacco products, while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers (within and outside the United States) products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences. Examples include tobacco-containing and nicotine-containing products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke and/or constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful, such as electronically heated tobacco products, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products.\nIn addition to internal product development, these efforts include arrangements with, or investments in, third parties such as our arrangement with PMI to commercialize IQOS devices and related Marlboro HeatSticks in the United States, which is governed by an exclusive license and distribution agreement. The IQOS devices and related Marlboro HeatSticks are currently subject to an importation ban and cease-and-desist orders imposed by the ITC. PM USA does not expect to have access to IQOS devices or the related Marlboro HeatSticks for sale and distribution during 2022. In addition, the initial 5-year term of this agreement expires in April 2024 and renews at our option for an additional 5-year period so long as we have achieved certain performance objectives. The initial term performance objectives are based on achieving 0.5% dollar share of the cigarette category within a certain period of time in a certain number of geographic areas. In addition, we maintain our exclusive distribution rights as to PMI during the term of the agreement so long as we have achieved certain performance objectives within a specified time period by April 2022. The exclusive distribution rights performance objectives are based on achieving 0.5% dollar share of the cigarette category within a certain period of time in a single geographic area. While we believe Altria has met the initial term and exclusive distribution rights performance objectives, PMI has communicated to us that it disagrees as to whether those objectives have been met. If we do not resolve this disagreement in a manner favorable to PM USA, it could result in the loss of (i) our unilateral right to extend the agreement for the additional 5-year period, and therefore we would no longer be able to commercialize IQOS devices and related Marlboro HeatSticks after April 2024, or (ii) our exclusive distribution rights as to PMI. For further discussion, see Note 18.\nAdditionally, our investment in JUUL subjects us to non-competition obligations restricting us from investing or engaging in the e-vapor business other than through JUUL, subject to certain exceptions.\nOur tobacco operating companies and investees may not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize these innovative products, which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams and on our ability to achieve our Vision.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether regulators, including the FDA, will permit the marketing or sale of any particular innovative products (including products with claims of reduced risk to adult tobacco consumers), the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products. In addition, the FDA could, for a variety of reasons, determine that innovative products currently on the market but pending FDA review of the associated PMTA (such as on! oral nicotine pouches), or those that have previously received authorization, including with a claim of reduced exposure (such as IQOS), are not appropriate for the public health and the FDA could require such products be taken off the market. See Tobacco Space - Business Environment - FSPTCA and FDA Regulation in Item 7 for further discussion. We also cannot predict whether these products will appeal to adult tobacco consumers or whether adult tobacco consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions would be affected by reduced-risk claims on such products if permitted. Adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products.\nIf our tobacco operating companies or investees do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products, including with claims of reduced risk, but one or more of their competitors does succeed, our tobacco operating companies or investees may be at a competitive disadvantage, which could have an adverse effect on their financial performance and on our ability to achieve our Vision.\nSignificant changes in price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials or component parts could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of Altria\u2019s tobacco operating companies and investees.\nAny significant change in prices, quality or availability of tobacco, other raw materials or component parts, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic conditions (including inflation, labor shortages and supply chain disruptions) or other factors, could adversely affect our tobacco operating companies\u2019 and our investees\u2019 profitability and business, as well as their ability to remain compliant with FDA and other regulatory requirements for tobacco products. For further discussion, see Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials and Component Parts in Item 7.\nAltria\u2019s tobacco operating companies and investees rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers, distributors and distribution chain service providers. An extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier, distributor or distribution chain service provider could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies and investees.\nAltria\u2019s tobacco operating companies and investees face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant manufacturing facilities and a small number of key suppliers, distributors and distribution chain service providers. A natural or man-made disaster, cyber-incident, global pandemic or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of Altria\u2019s tobacco operating companies or investees, the operations of any key supplier, distributor or distribution chain service provider of any of Altria\u2019s tobacco operating companies or investees or any other disruption in the supply or distribution of goods or services (including a key supplier\u2019s inability to comply with government regulations, lack of available workers or unwillingness to supply goods or services to a tobacco company) could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries and investees. Operations of Altria\u2019s tobacco operating companies, suppliers, distributors and distribution chain service providers and those of its investees could be suspended temporarily once or multiple times, or closed permanently, depending on various factors. An extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of Altria\u2019s tobacco operating companies, investees or in the supply or distribution of goods or services by one or more key suppliers, distributors or distribution chain service providers, could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies and investees.\nAltria\u2019s tobacco operating companies and investees could decide or be required to recall products, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, its tobacco operating companies and investees.\nIn addition to a recall required by the FDA, as referenced above, our tobacco operating companies and investees could decide, or other laws or regulations could require them, to recall products due to the failure to meet quality standards or specifications, suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination, or other adulteration, product misbranding or product tampering. Product recalls could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, its tobacco operating companies and investees.\nThe failure of Altria\u2019s or its investees\u2019 information systems or service providers\u2019 or key suppliers\u2019 information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, its subsidiaries or its investees.\nAltria and its subsidiaries rely extensively on information systems, many of which are managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax requirements; engaging in marketing and e-commerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating internally and externally with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult tobacco consumers and others. Suppliers and supply chain service providers also rely extensively on information systems. We continue to make appropriate investments in administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyber-threats, including human error and malicious acts. Our safeguards include employee training, testing and auditing protocols, backup systems and business continuity plans, maintenance of security policies and procedures, monitoring of networks and systems, and third-party risk management.\nFrom time-to-time Altria and its suppliers experience attempts to infiltrate and interrupt information systems. While infiltration attempts have increased, to date, interruptions of these information systems as a result of infiltration attempts have not had a material impact on our operations. However, because technology is increasingly complex and cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. Failure of Altria\u2019s or its investees\u2019 information systems or service providers\u2019 or key suppliers\u2019 information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could result in loss of revenue, assets, personal data, intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data, violation of applicable privacy and data security laws, reputational harm to the companies and their brands, operational disruptions, legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to Altria, its subsidiaries and its investees.\nAltria may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage, tobacco control actions and other factors, which could adversely affect Altria\u2019s ability to achieve its Vision.\nOur ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions. The tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that may enjoy greater societal acceptance and fewer longer-term challenges. As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent. In addition, our ability to retain the best talent may be adversely affected by current labor market dynamics in which the number of U.S. workers leaving their jobs increased significantly. Failure to attract and retain the best talent could adversely affect Altria\u2019s ability to achieve its Vision.\nAltria may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nWe periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment. This calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions (such as continued uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic), regulatory developments, changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences, success of planned new product expansions, competitive activity and income and excise taxes. Certain events also can trigger an immediate review of intangible assets. If an impairment is determined to exist in either situation, we will incur impairment losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. For further discussion, see Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7.\nRisks Related to the Capital Markets and Financing\nAcquisitions or other events may adversely affect Altria\u2019s credit rating, and Altria may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction.\nFrom time to time, Altria considers acquisitions, investments or dispositions and may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement. Although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time, it is possible that completing a given acquisition, investment, disposition or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our investment grade credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings as occurred following our investment in JUUL. Any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and also may increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or an investment. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our businesses or investments on favorable terms, which may result in a loss in our consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\nDisruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect Altria\u2019s access to these markets, earnings and dividend rate.\nAccess to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs. For example, we typically access the commercial paper market early in the second quarter to help fund payments under the Master Settlement Agreement (the \u201cMSA\u201d) tax obligations and shareholder dividends. Disruption and uncertainty in these markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability, pricing, credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.\nAltria may be unable to attract investors due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage.\nThere is increasing investor focus on environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters. Organizations that provide ESG information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Decreasing social acceptance of tobacco products or unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward Altria, which could result in shareholders choosing to divest their ownership in Altria stock or potential investors choosing not to invest in Altria stock and could have a negative impact on the market performance of Altria stock.\nRisks Related to Our Investments\nA challenge to our investment in JUUL, if successful, could result in a broad range of resolutions, including divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction.\nA challenge to our investment in JUUL, if successful, could result in a broad range of resolutions such as divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction. In April 2020, the FTC issued an administrative complaint against Altria and JUUL alleging that Altria\u2019s 35% investment in JUUL and the associated agreements constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 5 of the FTC Act, and substantially lessened competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The FTC seeks a broad range of remedies, including divestiture of Altria\u2019s investment in JUUL, rescission of the transaction and prohibition against any officer or director of either Altria or JUUL serving on the other\u2019s board of directors or attending meetings. The\nadministrative trial was held before an FTC administrative law judge in June 2021. In February 2022, the administrative law judge dismissed the FTC\u2019s complaint. FTC complaint counsel appealed that decision to the FTC Commissioners. Any adverse ruling the FTC Commissioners issue following their review may be appealed to a federal appellate court.\nAlso, various putative class action lawsuits have been filed against Altria (and in some cases, subsidiaries of Altria) and JUUL. The lawsuits cite the FTC administrative complaint referenced above and allege claims similar to those made by the FTC. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits are seeking various remedies, including treble damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, a declaration that the agreements between Altria and JUUL are invalid, divestiture of Altria\u2019s investment in JUUL and rescission of the transaction.\nA successful challenge by the FTC or the plaintiffs in the lawsuits to the investment would adversely affect us, including by eliminating, or substantially limiting, our rights with respect to our investment in JUUL, and could adversely affect the estimated fair value of our investment. For further discussion of the FTC administrative complaint, see Item 3 and Note 18.\nThe expected benefits of the JUUL transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all.\nRegardless of whether we successfully defend against the FTC\u2019s challenge to the JUUL transaction, the expected benefits of the JUUL transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all, including due to the risks encountered by JUUL in its business, some of which are described in various risk factors above, such as operational risks, competitive risks and regulatory and legislative risks at the international, federal, state and local levels, including actions by the FDA, and adverse publicity due to underage use of e-vapor products and other factors; unanticipated impacts on JUUL\u2019s relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties; potential disruptions to JUUL\u2019s management or current or future plans and operations; or domestic or international litigation developments, investigations or otherwise. As discussed in Note 18, JUUL and Altria and/or its subsidiaries, including PM USA, are named as defendants in various individual and class action lawsuits, including independent lawsuits initiated by certain state attorneys general. JUUL also is named in a significant number of additional individual and class action lawsuits to which neither Altria nor its subsidiaries is a party. See Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7 for a discussion of certain FDA-related regulatory risks applicable to the e-vapor category, including the potential removal of certain e-vapor products from the market as a result of FDA enforcement action and the potential denial of new tobacco product applications for e-vapor products. Failure to realize the expected benefits of our JUUL investment could adversely affect the value of the investment and could also adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.\nAs discussed in Note 6, as part of the preparation of our financial statements for the quarters ended September 30, 2019, December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2020, we performed valuations of our investment in JUUL as a result of the existence of impairment indicators. As a result, we determined that our investment in JUUL was impaired and recorded total non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $11.2 billion. Following Share Conversion (as defined in Note 6) in the fourth quarter of 2020, Altria elected to account for its equity method investment in JUUL under the fair value option. Under this option, Altria\u2019s consolidated statements of earnings (losses) include any cash dividends received from its investment in JUUL and any changes in the estimated fair value of its investment, which is calculated quarterly. While we believe the December 31, 2021 valuation of $1.7 billion is the appropriate current estimated fair value of our investment, the risks identified in this paragraph, some of which are also further discussed in Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Investment in JUUL and Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7 and in Note 18, are ongoing with respect to the current estimated fair value. Quarterly fair value changes could create volatility in Altria\u2019s consolidated financial position and earnings and, if the estimated fair value of our investment in JUUL decreases, it could have a material adverse effect on Altria\u2019s consolidated financial position or earnings.\nOur investment in JUUL includes non-competition, standstill and transfer restrictions that prevent us from gaining control of JUUL. Furthermore, if we elect not to extend our non-competition obligations beyond December 20, 2024, we would lose certain of our governance, consent, preemptive and other rights with respect to our investment in JUUL.\nThe shares of JUUL we hold generally cannot be sold or otherwise transferred until December 20, 2024, subject to limited exceptions. We also generally agreed not to compete with JUUL in the e-vapor category until at least December 20, 2024, which may be extended at our election. If, however, JUUL is prohibited by federal law from selling e-vapor products in the United States for at least one year or if Altria\u2019s carrying value of the JUUL investment is not more than 10% of its initial carrying value of $12.8 billion, we may elect to compete with JUUL in the e-vapor category prior to December 20, 2024. In addition, in the event we elect to exercise our board designation rights at JUUL, JUUL\u2019s board of directors will include nine members, three of whom will be designated by Altria, including one independent designee. JUUL\u2019s strategy and its material decisions are not and will not be controlled by us, and the terms of our agreements with JUUL mean that we are required to bear the risks associated with our investment in JUUL and are restricted from competing with JUUL until at least December 20, 2024, subject to the exceptions mentioned above. Further, if we elect not to extend our non-competition obligations beyond that date or to terminate such obligations in the circumstances described above, we would lose some or all of our board designation rights, preemptive rights, consent rights and other rights with respect to our investment in JUUL.\nAltria\u2019s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in ABI and the dividends paid by ABI on shares owned by Altria may be adversely affected by various factors, including foreign currency exchange rates and ABI\u2019s business results, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and ABI\u2019s stock price.\nFor purposes of financial reporting, the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ABI are translated into U.S. dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d) from various local currencies. In addition, ABI pays dividends in euros, which we convert into USD. During times of a strengthening USD against these currencies, our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ABI will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer USD and the dividends that we receive from ABI will convert into fewer USD. Dividends and earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ABI are also subject to the risks encountered by ABI in its business, its business outlook, cash flow requirements and financial performance, the state of the market and the general economic climate, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in 2020, as a result of the uncertainty, volatility and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ABI\u2019s business, ABI reduced by 50% its final 2019 dividend paid in the second quarter of 2020 and did not pay its interim 2020 dividend that would have been paid in the fourth quarter of 2020, which resulted in a reduction of cash dividends Altria received from ABI.\nIf the carrying value of our investment in ABI exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the investment is considered impaired, which would result in additional impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or earnings.\nAs further discussed in Note 6, in preparing our financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2021, we concluded that the carrying value of our investment in ABI exceeded the fair value of our equity investment in ABI and that the decline in fair value of our investment in ABI below its carrying value was other than temporary at September 30, 2021. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $6.2 billion for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2021 to (income) losses from equity investments in Altria\u2019s condensed consolidated statements of earnings (losses). If ABI is unable to successfully execute its business plans and strategies and the carrying value of our investment in ABI again exceeds the fair value of our investment in ABI, it could result in additional impairment losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or earnings.\nIf our percentage ownership in ABI were to decrease below certain levels, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, incur a reduction in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the ABI board of directors and be unable to account for our investment in ABI under the equity method of accounting.\nIn the event that our ownership percentage in ABI were to decrease below certain levels, (i) we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, (ii) the number of directors that we have the right to have appointed to the ABI board of directors could be reduced from two to one or zero and (iii) we may be unable to continue to account for our investment in ABI under the equity method of accounting.\nTax authorities may challenge the tax treatment of the consideration Altria received in the October 2016 SABMiller plc/ABI business combination (\u201cABI Transaction\u201d) and the tax treatment of our investment in ABI may not be as favorable as Altria anticipates.\nWhile we expect the tax treatment of the consideration that we received from the ABI Transaction to be respected, the statute of limitations for the tax year in which the transaction occurred has not expired. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and, if they do, what the outcome of any such challenge will be. In addition, there is a risk that the tax treatment of our investment in ABI may not be as favorable as we anticipate.\nThe expected benefits of the Cronos transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all.\nIn March 2019, we acquired common shares representing a 45% equity interest in Cronos, a warrant to acquire common shares representing an additional 10% equity interest in Cronos and anti-dilution protections to purchase Cronos shares to maintain our ownership percentage. There can be no assurance that we will realize the expected benefits of the Cronos transaction, including due to the risks encountered by Cronos in its business, some of which are described in various risk factors above, such as operational risks and legal and regulatory risks; unanticipated impacts on Cronos\u2019s relationships with third parties, its management, or its current or future plans and operations due to the Cronos transaction or other factors; or domestic or international litigation developments, tax disputes, investigations, or otherwise; or that Cronos will successfully execute its business plans and strategies. Further, a failure by Cronos or Altria to comply with applicable laws, including cannabis laws, could result in criminal, civil or tax liability or reputational harm for Altria.\nIf the carrying value of our investment in Cronos exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the investment is considered impaired, which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or earnings.\nAs further discussed in Note 6, in preparing our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, we concluded that our equity method investment in Cronos declined below its carrying value and that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the impairment was temporary. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $205 million to (income) losses from equity investments in our consolidated statement of earnings (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2021. If Cronos is unable to\nsuccessfully execute its business plans and strategies and the fair value of our investment in Cronos continues to decrease, it could result in additional impairment losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or earnings.", "PERMNO": 13901, "SIC": 2111, "TIC": "MO"}
