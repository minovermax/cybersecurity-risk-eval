{"cik": "1545654", "company": "Alexander & Baldwin, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nA&B\u2019s business and its common stock are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Form 10-K and the Company\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on information currently known, A&B believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting A&B\u2019s business and its common stock. However, the risks and uncertainties faced by A&B are not limited to those described below, nor are they listed in order of significance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to A&B or that it currently believes to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect A&B\u2019s business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nIf any of the following events occur, A&B\u2019s business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected, and the trading price of A&B common stock could materially decline.\nRisks Relating to A&B\u2019s Business\nNote: All references to \u201cA&B\u201d and \"the Company\" in this section refer to, and include, each segment and line of business comprising A&B, and any reference to any particular segment or line of business does not limit the foregoing.\nChanges in economic conditions may result in a decrease in market demand for A&B\u2019s real estate assets in Hawaii and the Mainland and its material and construction products.\nThe Company's business, including its assets and operations, are concentrated in Hawaii. A weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, military and consumer spending, public and private construction starts and spending, personal income growth, and employment, or the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, or economic conditions on the Mainland, may adversely affect the demand for or sale of Hawaii real estate, the level of real estate leasing activity in Hawaii and on the Mainland, and demand for the Company's materials and construction products. In addition, an increase in interest rates or other factors could reduce the market value of the Company's real estate holdings, as well as increase the cost of buyer financing that may reduce the demand for A&B's real estate assets.\nA&B may face new or increased competition.\nThere are numerous other developers, buyers, managers and owners of commercial and residential real estate and undeveloped land that compete or may compete with A&B for management and leasing revenues, land for development, properties for acquisition and disposition, and for tenants and purchasers of properties. Intense competition could lead to increased vacancies, decreased rents, sales prices or sales volume, or lack of development opportunities.\nGrace competes in an industry that favors the lowest bid. An increase in competition, including out-of-state contractors competing for a limited number of projects available, could lead to lost bids and lower prices and volume. Grace also mines aggregate and imports asphalt for sale. Grace's customers could seek alternative sources of supply, similar to some of its competitors that are importing liquid asphalt and aggregate.\nA&B may face potential difficulties in obtaining operating and development capital.\nThe successful execution of A&B\u2019s strategy requires substantial amounts of operating and development capital. Sources of such capital could include banks, life insurance companies, public and private offerings of debt or equity, including rights offerings, sale of certain assets and joint venture partners. If A&B\u2019s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, the cost to borrow may increase, or A&B may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms. Further, A&B relies on its ability to obtain and draw on a revolving credit facility to support its operations. Volatility in the credit and financial markets or deterioration in A&B\u2019s credit profile may prevent A&B from accessing funds. There is no assurance that any capital will be available on terms acceptable to A&B or at all to satisfy A&B\u2019s short or long-term cash needs.\nA&B may raise additional capital in the future on terms that are more stringent to A&B, that could provide holders of new issuances rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those currently held by A&B common stockholders, or that could result in dilution of common stock ownership.\nTo execute its business strategy, A&B may require additional capital. If A&B incurs additional debt or raises equity, the terms of the debt or equity issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of A&B common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of any new debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on A&B\u2019s operations than currently in place. If A&B issues additional common equity, either through\npublic or private offerings or rights offerings, your percentage ownership in A&B would decline if you do not participate on a ratable basis.\nFailure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in A&B\u2019s credit facilities could impose restrictions on A&B\u2019s business segments, capital availability or the ability to pursue other activities.\nA&B\u2019s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants. If A&B breaches any of the covenants and such breach is not cured in a timely manner or waived by the lenders, and results in default, A&B\u2019s access to credit may be limited or terminated and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts immediately due and payable.\nIncreasing interest rates would increase A&B\u2019s overall interest expense.\nInterest expense on A&B's floating-rate debt ($101.6 million of debt outstanding for the year ending December 31, 2016) would increase if interest rates rise.\nA&B\u2019s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.\nA&B's various businesses have significant operating agreements and leases that expire at various points in the future. These agreements and leases may not be renewed or could be replaced on less favorable terms.\nAn increase in fuel prices may adversely affect A&B\u2019s operating environment and costs.\nFuel prices have a direct impact on the health of the Hawaii economy. Increases in the price of fuel may result in higher transportation costs to Hawaii and adversely affect visitor counts and the cost of goods shipped to Hawaii, thereby affecting the strength of the Hawaii economy and its consumers. Increases in fuel costs also can lead to other non-recoverable, direct expense increases to A&B through, for example, increased costs of energy and petroleum-based raw materials used in the production of aggregate, and the manufacture, transportation, and placement of hot mix asphalt. Increases in energy costs for A&B\u2019s leased real estate portfolio are typically recovered from lessees, although A&B\u2019s share of energy costs increases as a result of lower occupancies, and higher operating cost reimbursements impact the ability to increase underlying rents. Rising fuel prices also may increase the cost of construction, including delivery costs to Hawaii, and the cost of materials that are petroleum-based, thus affecting A&B\u2019s real estate development projects.\nNoncompliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations may adversely affect A&B\u2019s business.\nA&B is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including government rate, land use, environmental, and tax regulations. Noncompliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing A&B\u2019s business could impose significant additional costs on A&B and adversely affect A&B\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. For example, the real estate segments are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, which, if changed, or not complied with may adversely affect A&B\u2019s business. The Company frequently utilizes Section 1031 of the IRS Code to defer taxes when selling qualifying real estate and reinvesting the proceeds in replacement properties. This often occurs when the Company sells bulk parcels of land in Hawaii or commercial properties in Hawaii or on the Mainland, all of which typically have a very low tax basis. A repeal of or adverse amendment to Section 1031, which has often been considered by Congress, could impose significant additional costs on A&B. A&B is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations, Environmental Protection Agency regulations, and state and county permits related to its operations. The Materials and Construction segment is additionally subject to Mine Safety and Health Administration regulations. The Land Operations segment is subject the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission\u2019s regulation of agreements between A&B and Hawaii\u2019s utilities regarding the sale of electric power, and various county, state and federal environmental laws, regulations and permits governing farming operations and generation of electricity (including, for example, the use of pesticides).\nChanges to, or A&B\u2019s violation of or inability to comply with any of the laws, regulations and permits mentioned above could increase A&B\u2019s operating costs or ability to operate the affected line of business.\nWork stoppages or other labor disruptions by the unionized employees of A&B or other companies in related industries may increase operating costs or adversely affect A&B's ability to conduct business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 54 percent of A&B's 806 regular full-time employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. A&B may be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of A&B or other companies in related industries against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices. Strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of the failure of A&B or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully. For example, in its Land Operations segment, A&B\nmay be unable to complete construction of its projects if building materials or labor are unavailable due to labor disruptions in the relevant trade groups.\nThe loss of or damage to key vendor and customer relationships may impact A&B\u2019s ability to conduct business and adversely affect its profitability.\nA&B\u2019s business is dependent on its relationships with key vendors, customers and tenants. The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may impact A&B\u2019s ability to conduct business and adversely affect its profitability.\nInterruption, breaches or failure of A&B\u2019s information technology and communications systems could impair A&B\u2019s ability to operate, adversely affect its profitability and damage its reputation.\nA&B is dependent on information technology systems. All information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns and security-threatening intrusions. Further, A&B may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at A&B\u2019s facilities. Any failure, or security breaches of, A&B\u2019s systems could result in interruptions in its service or production, lower profitability and damage to its reputation.\nA&B is susceptible to weather and natural disasters.\nA&B\u2019s real estate operations are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, fires, tornadoes and unusually heavy or prolonged rain, which could damage its real estate holdings and which could result in substantial repair or replacement costs to the extent not covered by insurance, a reduction in property values, or a loss of revenue, and could have an adverse effect on its ability to develop, lease and sell properties. The occurrence of natural disasters could also cause increases in property insurance rates and deductibles, which could reduce demand for, or increase the cost of owning or developing A&B\u2019s properties.\nDrought, greater than normal rainfall, hurricanes, low-wind conditions, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, fires, other natural disasters, agricultural pestilence, or negligence or intentional malfeasance by individuals, may also adversely impact the conditions of the land and thereby harming the prospects for the Land Operations segment, including agribusiness-related activities, the Company's renewable energy operations, and A&B's land infrastructure and facilities, including dams and reservoirs.\nFor the Materials and Construction segment, because nearly all of the segment's activities are performed outdoors, its operations are substantially dependent on weather conditions. For example, periods of wet or other adverse weather conditions could interrupt paving activities, resulting in delayed or loss of revenue, under-utilization of crews and equipment and less efficient rates of overhead recovery. Adverse weather conditions also restrict the demand for aggregate products, increase aggregate production costs and impede its ability to efficiently transport material.\nA&B maintains casualty insurance under policies it believes to be adequate and appropriate. These policies are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles. Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from physical damage to dams or crop damage, generally are not insured. In some cases A&B retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk. Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available. Finally, A&B retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance.\nHeightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact A&B\u2019s operations and profitability.\nWar, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, thereby adversely affecting Hawaii\u2019s economy and A&B. Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase the volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets.\nLoss of A&B\u2019s key personnel could adversely affect its business.\nA&B\u2019s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel, including its senior management and skilled employees. The loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect its future operating results because of such employee\u2019s experience, knowledge of its business and relationships. If key employees depart, A&B may have to incur significant costs to replace them, and A&B\u2019s ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner. A&B does not maintain key person insurance on any of its personnel.\nA&B is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, that could have an adverse effect on A&B.\nThe nature of A&B\u2019s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, relating to labor and employment matters, contractual disputes, personal injury and property damage, environmental matters, construction litigation, business practices, and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section. These disputes, individually or collectively, could harm A&B\u2019s business by distracting its management from the operation of its business. If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by A&B. For more information, see Item 3 entitled \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d As a real estate developer, A&B may face warranty and construction defect claims, as described below under \u201cRisks Related to A&B\u2019s Real Estate Activities.\u201d\nChanges in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may result in increased expenses or plan contributions.\nThe amount of A&B\u2019s employee pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations. Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may result in increased cost or required plan contributions. In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect A&B\u2019s single-employer pension plans and plan funding. These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions. Although A&B has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that it will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases.\nRisks Relating to A&B\u2019s Real Estate Activities\nA&B is subject to risks associated with real estate construction and development.\nA&B\u2019s development projects are subject to risks relating to A&B\u2019s ability to complete its projects on time and on budget. Factors that may result in a development project exceeding budget or being prevented from completion include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nan inability of A&B or buyers to secure sufficient financing or insurance on favorable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nconstruction delays, defects, or cost overruns, which may increase project development costs;\n\u2022\nan increase in commodity or construction costs, including labor costs;\n\u2022\nthe discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other environmental, culturally-sensitive, or related issues;\n\u2022\nan inability to obtain, or a significant delay in obtaining, zoning, construction, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in complying with local, city, county and state rules and regulations regarding permitting, zoning, subdivision, utilities, affordable housing and water quality, as well as federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats;\n\u2022\nan inability to have access to sufficient and reliable sources of water or to secure water service or meters for its projects;\n\u2022\nan inability to secure tenants or buyers necessary to support the project or maintain compliance with debt covenants;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve or sustain anticipated occupancy or sales levels;\n\u2022\nbuyer defaults, including defaults under executed or binding contracts;\n\u2022\ncondemnation of all or parts of development or operating properties, which could adversely affect the value or viability of such projects; and\n\u2022\nan inability to sell A&B\u2019s constructed inventory.\nInstability in the financial industry could reduce the availability of financing.\nSignificant instability in the financial industry like that experienced during the financial crisis of 2008-2009, may result in, among other things, declining property values and increasing defaults on loans. This, in turn, could lead to increased regulations, tightened credit requirements, reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for virtually all borrowers. Fewer loan products and strict loan qualifications make it more difficult for borrowers to finance the purchase of units in A&B\u2019s projects. Additionally, more stringent requirements to obtain financing for buyers of commercial properties make it significantly more difficult for A&B to sell commercial properties and may negatively impact the sales prices and other terms of such sales. Deterioration in the credit environment may also impact A&B in other ways, including the credit or solvency of customers, vendors, tenants, or joint venture partners, the ability of partners to fund their financial obligations to joint ventures and A&B's access to mortgage financing for its own properties.\nA&B is subject to a number of factors that could cause leasing rental income to decline.\nA&B owns a portfolio of commercial income properties. Factors that may adversely affect the portfolio\u2019s profitability include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\na significant number of A&B\u2019s tenants are unable to meet their obligations;\n\u2022\nincreases in non-recoverable operating and ownership costs;\n\u2022\nA&B is unable to lease space at its properties when the space becomes available;\n\u2022\nthe rental rates upon a renewal or a new lease are significantly lower than prior rents or do not increase sufficiently to cover increases in operating and ownership costs;\n\u2022\nthe providing of lease concessions, such as free or discounted rents and tenant improvement allowances; and\n\u2022\nthe discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other environmental, culturally-sensitive, or related issues at the property.\nThe bankruptcy of key tenants may adversely affect A&B\u2019s cash flows and profitability.\nA&B may derive significant cash flows and earnings from certain key tenants. If one or more of these tenants declare bankruptcy or voluntarily vacates from the leased premise and A&B is unable to re-lease such space or to re-lease it on comparable or more favorable terms, A&B may be adversely impacted. Additionally, A&B may be further adversely impacted by an impairment or \u201cwrite-down\u201d of intangible assets, such as lease-in-place value, favorable lease asset, or a deferred asset related to straight-line lease rent, associated with a tenant bankruptcy or vacancy.\nGovernmental entities have adopted or may adopt regulatory requirements that may restrict A&B\u2019s development activity.\nA&B is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the land development process, including laws and regulations related to zoning and permitted land uses. Government entities have adopted or may approve regulations or laws that could negatively impact the availability of land and development opportunities within those areas. It is possible that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers in the future that could adversely affect A&B\u2019s ability to develop projects in the affected markets or could require that A&B satisfy additional administrative and regulatory requirements, which could delay development progress or increase the development costs to A&B.\nReal estate development projects are subject to warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.\nAs a developer, A&B is subject to warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The amounts payable under these claims, both in legal fees and remedying any construction defects, can be significant and could exceed the profits made from the project. As a consequence, A&B may maintain liability insurance, obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from contractors generally covering claims related to workmanship and materials, and create warranty and other reserves for projects based on historical experience and qualitative risks associated with the type of project built. Because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters, A&B cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage, contractor arrangements and reserves will be adequate to address some or all of A&B\u2019s warranty and construction defect claims in the future. For example, contractual indemnities may be difficult to enforce, A&B may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions, and certain claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally,\nthe coverage offered and the availability of liability insurance for construction defects could be limited or costly. Accordingly, A&B cannot provide any assurance that such coverage will be adequate, available at an acceptable cost, or available at all.\nA&B is involved in joint ventures and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships.\nA&B is involved in joint venture relationships and may initiate future joint venture projects. A joint venture involves certain risks such as, among others:\n\u2022\nA&B may not have voting control over the joint venture;\n\u2022\nA&B may not be able to maintain good relationships with its venture partners;\n\u2022\nthe venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with A&B\u2019s economic or business interests;\n\u2022\nthe venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations and development activities or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to A&B;\n\u2022\nthe joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel\n\u2022\nthe venture partner could become insolvent, requiring A&B to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project, and any resulting bankruptcy proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the project or the joint venture; and\n\u2022\nA&B may be required to perform on guarantees it has provided or agrees to provide in the future related to the completion of a joint venture's construction and development of a project, joint venture indebtedness, or on indemnification of a third party serving as surety for a joint venture's bonds for such completion.\nA&B\u2019s financial results are significantly influenced by the economic growth and strength of Hawaii.\nVirtually all of A&B\u2019s real estate development activity is conducted in Hawaii. Consequently, the growth and strength of Hawaii\u2019s economy has a significant impact on the demand for A&B\u2019s real estate development projects. As a result, any adverse change to the growth or health of Hawaii\u2019s economy could have an adverse effect on A&B\u2019s real estate business.\nThe value of A&B\u2019s development projects and its commercial properties are affected by a number of factors.\nThe Company has significant investments in various commercial real estate properties, development projects, and joint venture investments. Weakness in the real estate sector, especially in Hawaii, difficulty in obtaining or renewing project-level financing, and changes in A&B\u2019s investment and development strategy, among other factors, may affect the fair value of these real estate assets owned by A&B or by its joint ventures. If the fair value of A&B\u2019s joint venture development projects were to decline below the carrying value of those assets, and that decline was other-than-temporary, A&B would be required to recognize an impairment loss. Additionally, if the undiscounted cash flows of its commercial properties or development projects were to decline below the carrying value of those assets, A&B would be required to recognize an impairment loss if the fair value of those assets were below their carrying value.\nA&B\u2019s ability to use or lease agricultural lands for agricultural purposes may be limited by government regulation.\nGiven the large scale of its agricultural landholdings on Maui and Kauai, many of the third parties to whom A&B leases land for agricultural purposes may be characterized as large scale commercial agricultural operations. Legislation passed on Kauai placed restrictions on the ability of such operations to use land within specified distances of highways, schools, oceans, streams, residences, parks, care homes, hospitals and other similar uses, to grow crops other than ground cover. This legislation also put significant restrictions regarding, and public notification obligations concerning, pesticide use on such operations and limited their ability to use genetically modified organism (GMO) crops. On Maui, similar legislation passed by a voter initiative placed a moratorium on the ability to farm GMO crops. In November 2016, the Kauai and Maui legislation was invalidated by the courts. If additional legislative agricultural restrictions are passed, such as restrictions on the use of pesticides, the ability of A&B to use or lease its lands for large scale agricultural purposes, and any rents that it can achieve for those lands, may be adversely affected.\nThe transition to a diversified agricultural model is subject to both the risks affecting the business generally and the inherent difficulties associated with implementing a new strategy.\nThe ability to transition to a new diversified model and improve the operating results depends upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe extent to which management has properly understood and is able to manage the dynamics and demands of the various farming operations comprising the diversified agricultural model, in which the Company may have limited or no prior experience;\n\u2022\nthe ability to transition from the sugar operations in an orderly and efficient manner;\n\u2022\nthe time required to prepare the land previously under sugar cane cultivation and ready it for a new purpose under the diversified model;\n\u2022\nthe ability to respond to any unanticipated changes in expected cash flows, liquidity, cash needs and cash expenditures with respect to the new diversified model, including the Company's ability to obtain any additional financing or other liquidity enhancing transactions, if and when needed;\n\u2022\nthe ability to execute strategic initiatives in a cost-effective manner, including identifying business partners to explore potential opportunities;\n\u2022\nThe Company's ability to access adequate, affordable and uninterrupted sources of water (see the \"The lack of water for agricultural irrigation could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Land Operations segment\" risk factor below);\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be able to transition to and implement a new diversified agricultural model, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations.\nThe diversified agricultural model may not achieve the financial results expected.\nThe Company is currently evaluating several categories of replacement agricultural activities in the transition to the diversified model, including but not limited to energy crops, agroforestry, grass finished livestock operations, diversified food crops/agricultural park, and orchard crops. There is no assurance that the Company's replacement agricultural activities will be economically feasible or improve the Land Operations segment's operating results.\nA&B\u2019s power sales contracts could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.\nA&B\u2019s power sales contracts expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, which could adversely affect Land Operations profitability.\nThe market for power sales in Hawaii is limited.\nThe power distribution systems in Hawaii are small and island-specific; currently, there is no ability to move power generated on one island to any other island. In addition, Hawaii law limits the ability of independent power producers, such as A&B, to sell their output to firms other than the respective utilities on each island, without themselves becoming utilities and subject to the State\u2019s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) regulation. Further, any sales of electricity by A&B to the utilities on each island are subject to the approval of the PUC. Unlike some areas in the Mainland, Hawaii\u2019s independent power producers have no ability to use utility infrastructure to transfer power to other locations.\nRisks Relating to A&B\u2019s Agribusiness-related Activities\nThe lack of water for agricultural irrigation could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the land Operations segment.\nIt is crucial for the Company's land to have access to sufficient, reliable and affordable sources of water in order to conduct any agricultural activity. As further described in \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d there are regulatory and legal challenges to the Company\u2019s ability to divert water from streams in Maui. In addition, access to water is subject to weather patterns that cannot be reliably predicted. If A&B is limited in its ability to divert stream waters for its use or there is insufficient rainfall on an extended basis, it would have a significant, adverse effect on the utility of the land and our ability to employ the land in active agricultural use.\nRisks Relating to A&B\u2019s Materials and Construction Operations\nA&B's Materials and Construction segment's revenue growth and profitability are dependent on factors outside of its control.\nA&B's Materials and Construction segment's ability to grow its revenues and improve profitability are dependent on factors outside of its control, which include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndecreased government funding for infrastructure projects (see the \"Economic downturns or reductions in government funding of infrastructure projects could reduce A&B's revenues and profits from its materials and construction businesses.\" risk factor below);\n\u2022\nreduced spending by private sector customers resulting from poor economic conditions in Hawaii;\n\u2022\nan increased number of competitors;\n\u2022\nless success in competitive bidding for contracts;\n\u2022\na decline in transportation and logistical costs, which may result in customers purchasing material from sources located outside of Hawaii in a more cost-efficient manner;\n\u2022\nlimitations on access to necessary working capital and investment capital to sustain growth; and\n\u2022\ninability to hire and retain essential personnel and to acquire equipment to support growth.\nEconomic downturns or reductions in government funding of infrastructure projects could reduce A&B's revenues and profits from its materials and construction businesses.\nThe segment's products are used in public infrastructure projects, which include the construction, maintenance and improvement of highways, streets, roads, airport runways and similar projects. A&B's materials and construction businesses, including its aggregates business, are highly dependent on the amount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depends on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. A&B cannot be assured of the existence, amount and timing of appropriations for spending on these and other future projects, including state and federal spending on roads and highways. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerous reasons, including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects (including federal funding), and other competing priorities for available state, local and federal funds. State spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreases or delays in, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding. The segment is reliant upon contracts with the City and County of Honolulu, the State of Hawaii and the Federal Government for a significant portion of its revenues. If revenues and profits are impacted by economic downturns or reductions in government funding, the segment\u2019s long-lived assets and goodwill may become impaired.\nA&B may face community opposition to the operation or expansion of quarries or other facilities.\nQuarries and other segment facilities require special and conditional use permits to operate. Permitting and licensing applications and proceedings and regulatory enforcement proceedings are all matters open to public scrutiny and comment. In addition, the Makakilo quarry is adjacent to residential areas and heavy equipment and explosives are used in the mining process. As a result, from time to time, A&B's Materials and Construction segment operations may be subject to community opposition and adverse publicity that may have a negative effect on operations and delay or limit any future expansion or development of segment operations.\nA&B's materials and construction businesses operate only in Hawaii, and adverse changes to the economy and business environment in Hawaii could adversely affect operations and profitability.\nBecause of its operations are concentrated in a specific geographic location, A&B's materials and construction businesses are susceptible to fluctuations in operations and profitability caused by changes in economic or other conditions in Hawaii.\nSignificant contracts may be canceled or A&B may be disqualified from bidding for new contracts.\nGovernmental entities typically have the right to cancel their contracts with A&B's construction businesses at any time with payment generally only for the work already completed plus a negotiated compensatory overhead recovery amount. In addition, A&B's construction businesses could be prohibited from bidding on certain governmental contracts if it fails to maintain qualifications required by those entities, such as maintaining an acceptable safety record.\nIf A&B's materials and construction businesses are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that it is ultimately awarded, the segment may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.\nThe majority of the Materials and Construction segment's revenues are derived from \u201cquantity pricing\u201d (fixed unit price) contracts. Approximately 40 percent of 2016 segment revenues and backlog are derived from \u201clump sum\u201d (fixed total price) contracts. Quantity pricing contracts require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Lump sum contracts require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price irrespective of actual quantities or actual costs. Expected profits on contracts are realized only if costs are accurately estimated and then successfully controlled. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected.\nIf A&B's materials and construction businesses are unable to attract and retain key personnel and skilled labor, or encounter labor difficulties, the ability to bid for and successfully complete contracts may be negatively impacted.\nThe ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables A&B's materials and construction businesses to successfully bid for and profitably complete its work. This includes members of management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, and foremen. The segment's future success will also depend on its ability to hire, train and retain, or to attract, when needed, highly skilled management personnel. If competition for these employees is intense, it could be difficult to hire and retain the personnel necessary to support operations. If A&B does not succeed in retaining its current employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly skilled employees, segment operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted.\nA majority of segment personnel are unionized. Any work stoppage or other labor dispute involving unionized workforce, or inability to renew contracts with the unions, could have an adverse effect on operations.\nA&B's construction and construction-related businesses may fail to meet schedule or performance requirements of its paving contracts.\nAsphalt paving contracts have penalties for late completion. In most instances, projects must be completed within an allotted number of business or calendar days from the time the notice to proceed is received, subject to allowances for additional days due to weather delays or additional work requested by the customer. If A&B's construction businesses subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled, A&B may be responsible for contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages, an amount assessed per day beyond the contractually allotted days, at the discretion of the customer. Under these circumstances, the total project cost could exceed original estimates and could result in a loss of profit or a loss on the project. Additionally, A&B's construction businesses enter into lump sum and quantity pricing contracts where profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond its control, which can cause actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of its original bid.\nTiming of the award and performance of new contracts could have an adverse effect on Materials and Construction segment operating results and cash flow.\nIt is generally very difficult to predict whether and when bids for new projects will be offered for tender, as these projects frequently involve a lengthy and complex design and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, segment results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the fluctuation may be substantial.\nThe uncertainty of the timing of contract awards after a winning bid is submitted may also present difficulties in matching the size of equipment fleet and work crews with contract needs. In some cases, A&B's materials and construction businesses may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment than is currently required, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts.\nIn addition, the timing of the revenues, earnings and cash flows from contracts can be delayed by a number of factors, including delays in receiving material and equipment from suppliers and services from subcontractors and changes in the scope of work to be performed.\nDependence on a limited number of customers could adversely affect A&B's materials and construction businesses and results of operations.\nDue to the size and nature of the segment's construction contracts, one or a few customers have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portion of consolidated segment revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, in 2016, approximately 90 percent of Grace's construction related revenue was generated from projects administered by the federal government, State of Hawaii, or the various counties in Hawaii where Grace served as general contractor or subcontractor. Similarly, segment backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. For example, the State of Hawaii comprised approximately 37 percent of Grace\u2019s construction backlog at December 31, 2016. The loss of business from any such customer, or a default or delay in payment on a significant scale by a customer, could have an adverse effect on A&B's materials and construction businesses or results of operations.\nA&B's materials and construction businesses are likely to require more capital over the longer term.\nThe property and machinery needed to produce aggregate products and perform asphaltic concrete paving contracts are expensive. Although capital needs over the next five years are expected to be relatively modest, over the longer term, A&B's materials and construction businesses may require increasing annual capital expenditures. The segment's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fund these expenditures depends on future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business, and other factors affecting operations, many of which are beyond A&B's control. If the segment is unable to generate sufficient cash to operate its business, it may be required, among other things, to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.\nAn inability to obtain bonding could limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that A&B's materials and construction businesses are able to pursue.\nAs is customary in the construction industry, A&B may be required to provide surety bonds to its customers to secure its performance under construction contracts. A&B's ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon its capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in relationship to the amount of backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. Events that adversely affect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. The inability to obtain adequate bonding would limit the amount that A&B's construction businesses are to able bid on new contracts and could have an adverse effect on the segment's future revenues and business prospects.\nA&B's Materials and Construction segment operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting A&B to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance.\nSegment employees are subject to the usual hazards associated with performing construction activities on road construction sites, plants and quarries. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. A&B maintains general liability and excess liability insurance, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, auto insurance and other types of insurance, all in amounts consistent with A&B\u2019s materials and construction businesses' risk of loss and industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities incurred in operations.\nInsurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of the segment's safety program. If insurance claims or costs were above its estimates, A&B's materials and construction businesses might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims, which could impact its ability to maintain or expand its operations.\nEnvironmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect A&B's materials and construction businesses' ability to conduct its business and could require significant expenditures.\nSegment operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, climate change and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water.\nA&B's materials and construction businesses could be held liable for such contamination created not only from their own activities but also from the historical activities of others on properties that the segment acquires or leases. Segment operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Violations of such laws and regulations could subject A&B to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third-party property damage or personal injury claims. In addition, these laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliance standards are becoming, increasingly stringent. Moreover, A&B cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures for, among other things, equipment not currently possessed, or the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to segment activities.\nShort supplies and volatility in the costs of fuel, energy and raw materials may adversely affect A&B's materials and construction businesses.\nA&B's materials and construction businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel, electricity and other energy sources for production and transportation. The financial results of these businesses have at times been affected by the high costs of these energy sources. Significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these energy sources have and may in the future reduce financial results. Moreover, fluctuations in the supply and costs of these energy sources can make planning business operations more difficult. A&B does not hedge its fuel price risk, but instead focuses on volume-related price reductions, fuel efficiency, alternative fuel sources, consumption and the natural hedge created by the ability to increase aggregates prices.\nSimilarly, segment operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt, which serves as a key raw material in the production of asphaltic concrete. Liquid asphalt is subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations, which are generally correlated to the price of crude oil, though not as closely as diesel or gasoline, and are beyond the control of A&B's materials and construction business. Accordingly, significant increases in the price of crude oil will have an adverse impact on the financial results of the materials and construction segment due to higher costs of production of asphaltic concrete. Conversely, significant declines in the price of oil had, and in the future, may have an adverse impact on A&B's material and construction sales of liquid asphalt concrete, due to lower costs of importing asphalt to Hawaii, which may result in customers sourcing liquid asphalt from competition located outside of Hawaii.\nRisks Relating to the Separation from Matson Navigation Company\nIf the Separation were to fail to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then A&B, Matson, Inc. (\"Matson\") and the shareholders who received their shares of A&B common stock in the Separation could be subject to significant tax liability or tax indemnity obligations.\nPrior to June 29, 2012, A&B\u2019s businesses included Matson Navigation Company, a wholly owned subsidiary that provided ocean transportation, truck brokerage and intermodal services. As part of a strategic initiative designed to allow A&B to independently execute its strategies and to enhance and maximize its earnings, growth prospects and shareholder value, A&B made a decision to separate the transportation businesses from the Hawaii real estate and agriculture businesses. In preparation for the separation, A&B modified its legal-entity structure and became a wholly owned subsidiary of a newly created entity, Alexander & Baldwin Holdings, Inc. (\u201cHoldings\u201d). On June 29, 2012, Holdings distributed to its shareholders all of the shares of A&B stock in a tax-free distribution (the \u201cSeparation\u201d). Holders of Holdings common stock continued to own the transportation businesses, but also received one share of A&B common stock for each share of Holdings common stock held at the close of business on June 18, 2012, the record date. Following the Separation, Holdings changed its name to Matson. On July 2, 2012, A&B began regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cALEX\u201d as an independent, public company.\nMatson received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS Ruling\") that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) certain transactions to be effected in connection with the Separation qualify as a reorganization under Sections 355 and/or 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"), or as a complete liquidation under Section 332(a) of the Code and (ii) the Separation qualifies as a transaction under Section 355 of the Code. In addition to obtaining the IRS Ruling, Matson received a tax opinion (\"Tax Opinion\") from the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (which Tax Opinion relies on the effectiveness of the IRS Ruling) substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Separation and certain related transactions qualify as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code. The IRS Ruling and Tax Opinion rely on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from A&B and Matson regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and Tax Opinion, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") could determine on audit that the Separation and related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings\nare not correct or have been violated, or that the Separation and related transactions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the Separation or if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions in the Tax Opinion that are not covered by the IRS Ruling. If the Separation and related transactions ultimately were determined to be taxable, the distribution of A&B stock in the Separation could be treated as taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the shareholders who received their shares of A&B common stock in the Separation, and such shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, Matson would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares of A&B common stock distributed to Matson's shareholders on the Separation date over Matson tax basis in such shares.\nIn addition, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement that A&B entered into with Matson, A&B also generally is responsible for any taxes imposed on Matson that arise from the failure of the Separation and certain related transactions to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Sections 355 and 368 of the Code, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to A&B\u2019s stock, assets or business, or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by A&B and its subsidiaries in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the materials submitted to the IRS in connection with the request for the IRS Ruling or the representation letter provided to counsel in connection with the Tax Opinion. The amounts of any such taxes could be significant.", "PERMNO": 13429, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "ALEX"}
