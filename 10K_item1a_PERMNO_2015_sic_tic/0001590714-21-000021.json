{"cik": "1590714", "company": "Element Solutions Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of \"risk factors\" identifies the material factors that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Potential investors should carefully consider these risks and the other information in this 2020 Annual Report when evaluating our business. This discussion is not all inclusive and additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business operations and cause our future results to differ from our expectations.\nBUSINESS & OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain and subject to change.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has evolved into a global pandemic that negatively impacts the global economy, disrupts global supply chains and creates significant volatility in commercial and financial markets. The extent to which this pandemic will continue to impact our business or our future results of operations, financial condition, expected cash flows and/or stock price is currently unknown and will depend on the duration of the pandemic; the efficacy, availability and/or public acceptance of vaccines targeting COVID-19; the impact of variants of COVID-19 that may affect its spread or virulence or the effectiveness of vaccines on the virus; and other numerous and evolving factors that at this time are highly uncertain, vary by market and cannot be accurately predicted or quantified.\nThese factors include the effect of actions taken or that might be taken by governments, businesses or individuals to contain or reduce the repercussions of the pandemic and mitigate its economic implications; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; decreased consumer spending levels; reduction or changes in customer demand for our products and services; our ability to manufacture, sell and provide our products and services, including as a result of travel restrictions, closed borders, operating restrictions imposed on our facilities or reduced ability of our employees to continue to work efficiently; increased operating costs (whether as a results of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs or otherwise); collectability of customer accounts; additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the dollar; and the general impact of the pandemic on our customers, employees, suppliers, vendors and other stakeholders. Additionally, customers might defer decision making, delay orders or seek to renegotiate or terminate existing agreements. Our management is focused on mitigating the impact of the pandemic, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources across our Company and could delay other value-added initiatives. These factors could materially adversely affect our future business and our future results of operations, financial condition, expected cash flows and/or stock price, and the actual results that we will experience may differ materially from our estimates.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in the competitive markets in which we operate and, as a result, we may experience pricing pressure, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and the loss of market share.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in the competitive markets in which we operate. In these markets, we encounter competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater resources and greater brand recognition, and a larger base of customers than we do. As a result, we may lose business if we are unable to devote greater resources to the research and development, manufacturing, formulation, promotion, sale or support of our products, withstand adverse changes in economic conditions or prices of raw materials, and/or maintain competitive pricing. In addition, our competitors could enter into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers which could limit our ability to generate sales, acquire necessary raw materials and/or significantly increase costs.\nThe markets in which we operate are driven by consumer preferences that are rapidly changing as well as frequent new product introductions and improvements. As a result, we must develop new products and services that offer distinct value to our customers in order to compete successfully. We seek to provide products tailored to the often-unique and evolving needs of our customers which require an ongoing level of innovation. Our inability to anticipate customers\u2019 changing needs or adapt to emerging technological and business trends accurately, control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could adversely affect our ability to sustain our market positions and/or penetrate new markets.\nConsolidation of our competitors could also place us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our profitability. We operate in industries which are fragmented on a global scale, but in which there has been a trend toward consolidation in recent years. Consolidations of our competitors may jeopardize the strength of our positions in one or more of our markets which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as our growth potential.\nIf we don't successfully execute our go-to-market strategy, our business and financial performance may suffer.\nOur go-to-market strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products and services as well as introducing new products and services to meet the demands of our customers in a continually changing technological landscape. To successfully execute this strategy, we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong, identify and capitalize on organic growth, and innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories. Any failure to successfully execute this strategy, including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the process of developing new high-technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain. After we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and maintaining the high quality level that our customers expect. To this end, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements. Any delay in the development, forecast, production or marketing of a new product, service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position.\nOur substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur products are manufactured, formulated, distributed and sold globally. In 2020, approximately 74% of our net sales were generated from non-U.S. operations. As a result, we face certain risks inherent in international trade which may reduce our international sales and harm our business, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in currency values and foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022political instability, war, terrorism and other political risks;\n\u2022adverse tax consequences, including as a result of transfer pricing practices involving our foreign operations, and additional withholding taxes or other taxes on foreign income;\n\u2022foreign exchange controls or other currency restrictions and limitation on the movement of funds, potentially leading to the inability to readily repatriate earnings from foreign operations effectively;\n\u2022establishing and maintaining relationships with local distributors and OEMs;\n\u2022global trade barriers, including tariff increases and retaliations, restrictive regulations and potential boycotts;\n\u2022instability in certain countries and negative impact on the global economy;\n\u2022import and export control and licensing requirements;\n\u2022public health crises, including the occurrence of contagious diseases or illnesses, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022business cultures accepting of various levels of corruption;\n\u2022compliance with a variety of U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, the anti-bribery laws of other countries and rules regarding conflict minerals by us, our employees, suppliers or distributors;\n\u2022compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including unexpected changes in taxation and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property than in the U.S.;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations; and\n\u2022challenges in maintaining an effective internal control environment, including language and cultural differences, varying levels of GAAP expertise and internal control over financial reporting.\nAny of these risks could impact our ability to manufacture, source, sell or export our products or repatriate profits. We could also experience a loss of sales and profitability from our international operations, and/or a substantial impairment or loss of assets, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, changes in U.S. policy regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could negatively impact our business. For example, trade tensions between the U.S. and China and other countries have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on certain goods imported from those countries and have resulted in retaliatory tariffs by their governments. At this time, it is unclear how long U.S. tariffs on these goods will remain in effect or whether additional tariffs will be imposed. Additional tariffs that may be imposed by the U.S., or further retaliatory trade measures that may be taken in response, by China or other countries, could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or that otherwise may adversely impact our results of operations.\nSimilarly, the U.K.'s exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the U.K. and the E.U., and possibly other countries, including with respect to compliance with the regulatory regimes regarding the labeling and registration of the products we sell in these markets. The U.K. formally left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, starting an 11-month transition period in which a new trading relationship for goods and services was to be negotiated. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and E.U. announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues. While we have taken steps to mitigate any disruption to our operations by Brexit, we cannot predict the future implications of the post-Brexit deal and could face increased regulatory costs, further volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and other related risks which could result in a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel, including our executive officers, or effectively manage succession could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business involves complex operations and, therefore, our success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction. In addition, due to the specialized and technical nature of our business, our future performance depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees, such as our specialized research and development and sales and service personnel, in order to maintain our efficient production processes, drive innovation in our product offerings and maintain our deep customer relationships. The failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we are highly dependent on the experience and track records of Sir Martin E. Franklin, our other Board members and our executive leadership team. If one or more of our executive officers or Board members were to cease to be employed by us or to serve as directors, or if we were unable to replace them in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price could be adversely affected.\nOur reliance on certain key customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers could adversely affect our overall sales and profitability.\nAlthough we believe our business is not materially dependent upon any single customer, the loss of one or more key customers may impair our results of operations for the affected earnings periods. In addition, there is limited available manufacturing capacity that meets our quality standards and regulatory requirements. If we are unable to arrange for sufficient production capacity among our suppliers or contract manufacturers, or if our suppliers or contract manufacturers encounter production, quality, financial or other difficulties (including due to the COVID-19 pandemic or labor or geopolitical disturbances), we may be unable to meet our customers' demands. Finally, we rely on independent distributors to distribute our products and to assist us with the marketing and sale of certain of our products. There can be no assurance that our distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products to end users, or will be successful in selling our products, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or divestitures which may adversely affect our existing businesses, reputation and financial condition.\nWe have in the past completed several acquisitions and divestitures and may in the future pursue additional opportunistic strategic transactions. Our ability to benefit from acquisitions or divestitures depends on many factors, including our ability to negotiate favorable transaction terms, close such transactions in a timely and cost-effective manner and successfully integrate any businesses we acquire.\nWith respect to acquisitions, we may be exposed to successor liability relating to actions taken before the acquisition. The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition, the controls and policies we implement and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies or assets may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities. Acquisitions also involve compliance and reputational risks, as well as risks relating to differing levels of management and internal control effectiveness, systems integration, impairment charges relating to recorded goodwill and intangible assets, significant accounting charges and expenses resulting from the completion and integration of a sizable acquisition and the need to fund increased capital expenditures, working capital requirements and employee retention.\nIn addition to unanticipated delays, costs and other issues, divestitures may expose us to liabilities or claims for indemnification for retained liabilities or indemnification obligations associated with the assets or businesses that we sell. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction, as it was the case for certain liabilities retained in connection with the Arysta Sale and described under Note 5, Discontinued Operations, to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in this 2020 Annual Report. We cannot predict the ultimate resolution of these matters, and there can be no assurance that any such resolution, which may take several years, will not adversely impact our financial position or results of operations.\nINDUSTRY RISK FACTORS\nIndustry and consumer trends may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe specialty chemical industry is subject to constant and rapid technological change, product obsolescence, price erosion, evolving standards, finite product lifecycles, raw material price fluctuations, and changes in product supply and demand. For example, the mobile device market, particularly smartphones and tablets, is characterized by rapidly changing market conditions, frequent product introductions and intense competition based on features and price, which could impact our sale volumes and margins. In the automotive industry, demand for our products and services may be affected by technological advances, changing automotive OEM specifications and other factors that impact production levels of our customers that we cannot control, such as interest rates, fuel prices, shifts in vehicle mix, consumer confidence, regulatory and legislative oversight requirements and trade agreements. In addition, technological changes in our customers\u2019 products or processes may make certain of our specialty chemicals unnecessary or obsolete. Customers also have found, and may continue to find, alternative materials or processes which no longer require our products. Finally, the specialty chemical industry is currently being affected by globalization and a shift in customers\u2019 businesses. All these factors, consumer trends and industry characteristics may impact the demand for our products which may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow.\nFluctuations in the supply and prices of raw materials may negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe unavailability or increased prices of raw materials could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We use a variety of specialty and commodity chemicals in our formulation processes, and such formulation operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis. We typically purchase our major raw materials under existing supply agreements or on an as-needed basis from outside sources. The availability and prices of raw materials may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, the financial stability of our suppliers, new laws or regulations, protectionist nationalistic trade policies and practices, changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels. In some cases, we are limited in our ability to purchase certain raw materials from other suppliers by our supply agreements which contain certain minimum purchase requirements.\nThe requirement of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, relating to the annual disclosure of a company's use of conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold) mined from covered countries (Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries) in its products could affect the sourcing, pricing, and availability of these conflict minerals. If only a limited pool of our suppliers can demonstrate that they do not source any conflict minerals from the covered countries or as permitted under the conflict minerals rules, we may not be able to obtain conformant conflict minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.\nCommodities and energy prices are subject to volatility caused by market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, production and transportation disruptions, climate change and weather conditions and other world events. As we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control, if the cost of energy, shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along those costs to our customers, our profit margins and working capital would be adversely impacted. Also, increasing our prices could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers were to find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients, which could have an adverse long-term impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to price our products competitively to timely reflect volatility in prices of raw materials or if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials needed for a specific geographic region, our margins could be adversely affected.\nLEGAL & REGULATORY RISK FACTORS\nIntellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nProtection of our proprietary processes, methods, formulations and other technology is important to our business. To protect our intellectual property rights, we generally rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws of the U.S. and certain other countries, in which our products are manufactured or sold, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements. The laws of other countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights, domestically or internationally, may result in the loss of valuable technologies and our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of one or more competitive advances and decreased sales and/or market shares. Additionally, we rely in some cases upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third-parties to protect our intellectual property, our confidentiality agreements could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for, or adequate remedies to protect, our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information.\nFurther, protecting against the unauthorized use of our products, technology and other proprietary rights is difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and we cannot be certain that the steps we are taking will prevent or minimize the risks of such unauthorized use. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could also result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could significantly harm our results of operations and reputation.\nAdditionally, we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies. If we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others, we may be liable for material damages and/or be required to change our processes, redesign our products partially or completely, pay to use the technology of others, stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel, and result in costly litigation. Any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could also prevent us from offering certain of our products and/or require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights. Any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nFinally, our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may increase as a result of acquisitions, as we would have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology and the steps taken to safeguard against the risks of infringing the rights of third parties.\nGlobal Regulations\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state, and other countries' and jurisdictions' income, payroll, property, sales and use, and other types of taxes. Tax laws and regulations may not be clear or consistently applied and are subject to sudden change. Changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities may require significant judgment in determining the appropriate provision and related accruals for these taxes. As a result of these uncertainties, we could be subject to substantially higher taxes, which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nCurrently, a significant amount of our net sales are generated from customers located outside of the U.S., and a large portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the U.S. The U.S., the E.U. and its member states, along with numerous other countries, are currently engaged in establishing fundamental changes to tax laws affecting the taxation of multinational corporations. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (or TCJA), enacted on December 22, 2017, contained significant changes to certain U.S. tax laws relevant to us. Regulatory guidance on the TCJA remains limited and to date, the TCJA has had an adverse effect on the U.S. federal income taxation of our operations, including significantly limiting interest expense deductions and imposing new U.S. taxes on certain earnings of non-U.S. entities on a current basis. In addition, the recent change of U.S. administration could lead to changes in tax laws, including a proposed increase in the U.S. corporate income tax\nrate, increased U.S. taxation of certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the creation of a penalty on certain imports and a minimum tax on worldwide book income. These proposals (if enacted, in whole or in part) and other potential changes in U.S. and/or non-U.S. tax law could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax obligations and negatively impact our cash flows in the future. See Note 11, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2020 Annual Report for additional information.\nWe are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and non-U.S. tax authorities in the countries and jurisdictions in which we operate at the discretion of such tax authorities, and we may be subject to further tax assessments as a result of such audits in the future. During these audits, tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and any amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our tax expense, and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flow.\nChemical manufacturing is inherently hazardous and may result in accidents, which may disrupt our operations or expose us to significant losses or liabilities.\nThe hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes are inherent in our operations as our research and development, manufacturing, formulating and packaging activities involve the use of hazardous materials and the generation of hazardous waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination, discharge or injury resulting from those materials. Also, our suppliers or contract manufacturers may use and/or generate hazardous materials in connection with producing our products. We may be required to indemnify our suppliers, contract manufacturers or waste disposal contractors against damages and other liabilities arising out of the production, handling or storage of our products or raw materials or the disposal of related wastes. Potential risks include explosions and fires, chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, and pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures. Those hazards may result in personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, which may result in a suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions, cleanup costs, and claims by governmental entities or third-parties. We are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities (including third-party manufacturing on a tolling basis), and the loss or shutdown of operations over an extended period could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations currently use, and have historically used, hazardous materials and generate, and have historically generated, quantities of hazardous waste. As a result, we are subject to regulatory oversight and investigation, remediation, and monitoring obligations at our current and former Superfund sites, as well as third-party disposal sites, under federal laws and their state and local analogues, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as analogous foreign laws. We are also subject to ongoing obligations at active sites in the U.S. and are conducting closure activities pursuant to the RCRA and CERCLA at several of our sites in the U.S. The costs and liabilities associated with these issues may be substantial and, to the extent not covered by insurance, may materially impact the financial health of the Company.\nOur products are subject to numerous, complex government regulations and compliance with these regulations could require us to incur additional costs or to reformulate or discontinue certain of our products.\nOur products are subject to numerous, complex federal, state, local and foreign customs regulations, imports and international trade laws, export control, antitrust laws, environmental and chemicals manufacturing, global climate change, health and safety requirements and zoning and occupancy laws that regulate manufacturers generally or govern the importation, promotion and sale of our products, the operation of factories and warehouse facilities and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, employees and competitors.\nOur products and manufacturing processes are also subject to numerous regulations and ongoing reviews by certain governmental authorities. Governmental, regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection are resulting in increased pressure for more stringent regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry. The European Union's REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals) regulations enacted in 2009 have been a continuing source of compliance obligations and restrictions on certain chemicals, and REACH-like regimes have now been adopted in several other countries. In the U.S., the core provisions of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) were amended in June 2016 for the first time in 40 years. Among the more significant changes are mandatory safety reviews of existing \"high priority\" chemicals and regulatory actions to control any \"unreasonable risks\" identified as a result of such reviews. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also must find no \"unreasonable risk\" associated\nwith any new chemical before it can be fully commercialized. These new mandates create uncertainty about whether existing chemicals of importance to our business may be designated for restriction and whether any new chemical approval process may become more difficult and costly. Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to the use in our products of certain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, and similar laws in other jurisdictions, also apply to us. All of these regulations and these types of changes in the Company's regulatory environment, particularly, but not limited to, in the U.S., the E.U. and China, may require us to re-design our products or supply chain to ensure compliance with the applicable standards; for example, by requiring the use of different types or sources of materials, which could have an adverse impact on the efficiency of our manufacturing process, the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or other similar effects, which could materially alter our market share and reputation, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have incurred, are incurring and will incur in the future, costs and capital expenditures to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. For example, we have several product lines that rely on lead-based solder and many others that historically did so. Legal claims have been brought alleging harmful exposures or contamination as a result of lead-based solder, and it is possible that we may face additional claims in the future. We are also currently involved in various environmental investigations due to historic operations. Liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be joint and several and imposed retroactively, regardless of fault or the legality of the activities that gave rise to the contamination. Some of our formulating and manufacturing facilities have an extended history of chemical formulating and manufacturing operations or other industrial activities, and contaminants have been detected at some of our sites and offsite disposal locations. Ultimate environmental costs and liabilities are difficult to predict and may significantly vary from current estimates. To the extent available, we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage. However, there can be assurance that we won\u2019t incur losses beyond the limits or outside the terms of such coverage. In addition, the discovery of additional contaminants, the inability or failure of other liable parties to satisfy their obligations, the imposition of additional cleanup obligations, or the commencement of related third-party claims could result in additional material costs and negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough it is our policy to comply with such laws and regulations, it is possible that we have not been, or may not be at all times, in material compliance with all such requirements. Current governmental, regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection are resulting in increased pressure for more stringent regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry. In addition, increasing focus on areas such as environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving standards, which may also evolve into new regulations and/or disclosure requirements. We expect these trends to continue and the ultimate cost of compliance could be material. In particular, changes in environmental and climate laws or regulations could lead to new or additional investment in production designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, for us and our suppliers. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could also subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur offshore oil industry products are subject to the hazards inherent in the offshore oil production and drilling industry, and we may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards.\nIn the offshore oil industry, we are subject to the hazards inherent in the offshore oil production and drilling industry. Our offshore business produces water-based hydraulic control fluids for major oil companies and drilling contractors to be used for potentially hazardous offshore deepwater production and drilling applications. Offshore deepwater oil production and drilling are subject to hazards that include blowouts, explosions, fires, collisions, capsizing, sinking and damage or loss to pipeline, subsea or other facilities from severe weather conditions. Those hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. A catastrophic occurrence at a location where our products are used may expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, product liability or commercial claims. To the extent available, we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is customary in our industry. Such insurance does not, however, provide coverage for all liabilities, and there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant offshore deepwater oil production or drilling event that results in liability to us that is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our products may be subject to various export control regulations and exports may require a license from the U.S. Department of State or the U.S. Department of Commerce.\nAs a global company, we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services, and technology. In the U.S., these laws include, among others, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), administered by the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Some of our products or technology may have military or strategic applications governed by the ITAR or represent so-called \u201cdual use\u201d items governed by the EAR. Although our relevant products are currently subject to automatic approval and do not require government licenses to be exported to certain jurisdictions or persons, this may change in the future if these laws and regulations are amended or if new laws or regulations are adopted. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and damage our reputation.\nOur international operations are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Under these laws, companies may also be held liable for actions taken by third-parties acting on their behalf, such as strategic or local partners or representatives. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. However, certain of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business have experienced a heightened risk for corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other improper practices and, despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. Failure by us or our intermediaries to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws may result in civil and/or criminal penalties or other sanctions, including disgorgement of profits and contract suspensions or cancellations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with international trade restrictions and economic sanctions laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have operations, assets and/or make sales in countries all over the world, including countries that are or may become the target of trade and economic restrictions from the U.S. and/or other countries, which we refer to collectively as \u201cEconomic Sanctions Laws.\u201d Economic Sanctions Laws are complex and change with time as international relationships and confrontations between and among nations evolve. For example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the U.S. State Department administer certain laws and regulations that impose penalties upon U.S. persons and entities and, in some instances, non-U.S. entities, for conducting activities or transacting business with certain countries, governments, entities, or individuals subject to Economic Sanctions Laws. We have established policies and procedures to assist with our compliance with Economic Sanctions Laws and believe we do not unlawfully conduct business in any sanctioned countries. However, given the breadth of our international operations and the scope of our sales globally, including via third-party distributors over whom we may have limited or no control, coupled with the complexity and ever-changing nature of Economic Sanctions Laws, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures have prevented in the past or will prevent at all times in the future a violation of these laws. Failure to comply with Economic Sanctions Laws, or allegations of such failure, could lead to investigations and/or actions being taken against us which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in data privacy and data protection laws and regulations, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely impact our business.\nOur global business is subject to a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the privacy of customers, employees and other third parties. The interpretation and application of such privacy laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the E.U. and the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) in the U.S., which became effective on January 1, 2020, is uncertain and evolving. For example, on July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield and ruled that transfers made pursuant to the Standard Contractual Clauses (or \"SCCs\") and other alternative transfer mechanisms need to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis to ensure E.U. standards of data protection are met in the jurisdiction where the data importer is based, and there continue to be concerns about whether the SCCs and other mechanisms will face additional challenges. Complying with these various laws and regulations is difficult and could require us to incur substantial costs or change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nAlthough we have implemented internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the GDPR, the CCPA and other privacy-related laws, rules and regulations, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures enable us to be fully compliant. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA or any other applicable regulatory requirements or orders, including, but not limited to, privacy, data protection, information security, or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations, in one or more jurisdictions within the E.U., the U.S. or elsewhere, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or individuals; subject us to significant fines, penalties, and/or judgments; require us to change our business practices; limit access to our products and services in certain countries; or otherwise adversely affect our business, as we would be at risk to lose both customers and sales, and incur substantial costs.\nFINANCIAL RISK FACTORS\nOur net sales and gross profit have varied depending on our product, customer and geographic mix for any given period which makes it difficult to forecast future operating results.\nOur net sales and gross profit vary among our products, customers and markets, and therefore may be different in future periods from historic or current periods. Overall gross profit margins in any given period are dependent in large part on the product, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period\u2019s net sales. Market trends, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory conditions and other factors may also result in reductions in revenue or pressure on the gross profit margins in a given period. The varying nature of our product, customer and geographic mix between periods has materially impacted our net sales and gross profit between periods during certain recessionary times and may lead to difficulties in measuring the potential impact of market, regulatory and other factors on our business. As a result, we may be challenged in our ability to forecast our future operating results.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, in 2020, approximately 74% of our net sales were generated from non-U.S. operations, which means that we have net sales, substantial assets, liabilities and costs denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements, we must translate those sales, assets, liabilities and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our Consolidated Financial Statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant changes to our results of operations from period to period. Additionally, volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including foreign currency hedging activities, we cannot guarantee that such risk management strategies will be effective, and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nChanges in the method for determining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and/or the replacement of LIBOR, could adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nOur Credit Agreement uses the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. In addition, amounts drawn under our Credit Agreement may bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR, depending on our selection of repayment options. In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the regulatory authority over LIBOR) announced that it would phase out the use of LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. Although a newly created index called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) has been presented as the alternative to LIBOR, there can be no guarantee that SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of LIBOR, including the possibility of SOFR as the dominant replacement, on our Credit Agreement and other debt instruments, and at this time, the effect of any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR on the Company remain uncertain. The market transition away from LIBOR towards SOFR, or any other alternative rate, is expected to be complicated and the overall financing market may be disrupted as a result of this replacement. Disruption in the financial markets or the inability to renegotiate our Credit Agreement and other debt instruments with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on interest expense related to our outstanding debt, which in turn may materially impact our financial position.\nOur Credit Agreement and other debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the 3.875% USD Notes due 2028 and other debt agreements governing our outstanding debt contain restrictive clauses, which may limit our activities and operational and financial flexibility, including, among other things, our ability to grant liens, pay cash dividends, enter new lines of business, repurchase our shares of common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. In addition, the Credit\nAgreement contains customary remedies, including the right of the lenders to take action with respect to the collateral securing outstanding loans, that would apply should we default or otherwise be unable to satisfy our debt obligations. These covenants may restrict our flexibility in operating our business. We may also not be able to borrow under the Credit Agreement if an event of default under the terms of this agreement occurs. As a result, we may be unable to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous, meet extraordinary capital needs, finance future operations, plan for or react to market conditions, or otherwise take actions that we believe are in the best interest of our businesses which, in turn, may adversely impact our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement requires that we meet certain financial ratios, including a first lien net leverage ratio based on net debt to EBITDA. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measures of liquidity defined in the Credit Agreement. Our ability to meet these financial covenants depends upon the future successful operating performance of our businesses. If we fail to comply with the Credit Agreement covenants, we would be in default under the term loan and revolving credit facility, and the maturity of our outstanding debt could be accelerated unless we were able to obtain waivers from our lenders. If we were found to be in default under the term loan and revolving credit facility, it could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, which would result in additional restrictions upon our business and impact our financial condition.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate initial principal amount of $1.08 billion, consisting of a revolving facility in an aggregate initial principal amount of $330 million maturing in 2024 and a term loan in an aggregate initial principal amount of $750 million maturing in 2026. At December 31, 2020, we had $735 million outstanding under the term loan and full capacity of our unused borrowing capacity of $325 million, net of letters of credit, under the revolving facility.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the 3.875% USD Notes due 2028 contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, subject to specified conditions, without the consent of the then-existing lenders, we may add certain incremental term loan or revolving credit facilities, or increase commitments under our revolving credit facility, by up to the sum of (x) the greater of (i) $460 million and (ii) 100% of our consolidated EBITDA, less certain amounts of indebtedness, and (y) an unlimited amount if, on a pro forma basis, (i) in case of incremental facilities that are secured on a pari passu basis with our obligations under the Credit Agreement, our total first lien net leverage ratio does not exceed 3.50 to 1.00, (ii) in case of incremental facilities that are secured on a junior basis, our senior secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 5.00 to 1.00, and (iii) in case of incremental facilities that are unsecured, our fixed charge coverage ratio does not exceed 2.00 to 1.00 (in each case, as defined in the Credit Agreement). Any significant indebtedness incurred by us or our subsidiaries could have the following material consequences:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings include instruments with variable rates of interest;\n\u2022increase our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt governed by more favorable terms.\nWe may also enter into additional debt transactions or credit facilities, including equipment loans, working capital lines of credit, senior notes and other long-term debt, which may increase our indebtedness and result in additional restrictions upon our businesses. In addition, major debt rating agencies regularly evaluate our debt based on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing debt ratings, and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets.\nAny future impairment of our tangible or intangible long-lived assets may materially affect our results of operations.\nAs a result of our historical acquisitions, as of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $3.11 billion of intangible assets and goodwill. Under GAAP, we review our intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, which includes a prolonged decline in the value of our stock price. Additionally, goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least annually. Indicators such as under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, changes in our strategy for our overall business or use of acquired assets, unexpected negative industry or economic trends, decreased market capitalization relative to net book values, unanticipated competitive activities, change in consumer demand, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired. To the extent any of our acquired assets do not perform as anticipated, whether due to internal or external factors, the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges. Our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets or goodwill, occur.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nWe have numerous equity instruments outstanding that could require the future issuance of additional shares of common stock, which issuance could result in significant dilution of ownership interests and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe have a number of equity instruments outstanding that could require us to issue additional shares of our common stock. Depending on the equity instrument, these additional shares may either be issued for no additional consideration or based on a fixed amount of additional consideration. Specifically, at December 31, 2020, we had outstanding the following:\n\u20224,374,068 RSUs which were granted to employees under our 2013 Plan with each RSU representing a contingent right to receive one share of our common stock (assuming performance-based RSUs vest at target level) or multiple shares depending upon the Company's performance; and\n\u2022565,620 options which, once vested, are exercisable to purchase shares of our common stock, on a one-for-one basis, at any time at the option of the holder.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had 6,321,576 shares available under the 2013 Plan (subject to increase in accordance with the terms of the 2013 Plan), net of the outstanding RSUs and options noted above, and 4,479,907 shares available under the ESPP.\nVolatility of our stock price could adversely affect us and our stockholders.\nOur stock price may experience substantial price volatility as a result of many factors, including, without limitation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community; speculation; announcement of acquisitions or divestitures; quarterly financial results and comparisons to estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by us; issuance of additional debt or equity; changes in key personnel or business strategy; material litigation or governmental investigations; and expectations regarding capital allocation, including any future shares repurchases and/or any future dividend payments, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends. General or industry specific market conditions, stock market performance or macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance may also affect the price of our stock. Further, in the past, market fluctuations and price declines in a company's stock have led to securities class action litigation, which could have a substantial cost and divert management time and resources regardless of their outcome.\nFuture issuances or sales of our common stock may depress the price of our common stock.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our shares of common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances or sales of our shares will have on the market price of such shares. Sales of substantial amounts of our shares, including sales by our executive officers, directors or significant stockholders, and shares issued in connection with any acquisition, or the perception that such sales or issuance could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock. Decline in the stock price of our common stock may also make it more difficult for us to finance acquisitions with shares of common stock and/or sell additional equity or equity-related securities in future offerings at a time and price we deem necessary or appropriate.\nWe may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to create and issue one or more additional series of preferred stock, and, with respect to each series, to determine the number of shares constituting the series and the designations and the powers, preferences and\nrights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, which may include dividend rights, conversion or exchange rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms and liquidation preferences, without stockholder approval. If we create and issue one or more series of preferred stock, it could affect the rights of our common stockholders or reduce the value of our outstanding common stock. Our Board could, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and which could have certain anti-takeover effects.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends.\nFuture dividends are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion. To the extent the Board determines to pay dividends on our common stock in the future, we will pay dividends at the times and in the amounts as the Board determines appropriate. The Board may, however, reduce or discontinue entirely the payment of such dividends at any time. Paying dividends will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements and access to capital markets, covenants associated with the Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the 3.875% USD Notes due 2028 and/or other debt obligations, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and other factors that the Board may deem relevant. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will have the ability and/or sufficient funds to pay dividends or as to the amounts of these dividends, if any.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems, including security breaches, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on information technology systems throughout the Company to, among other functions, control our manufacturing processes, process orders and bill, collect and make payments, interact with customers and suppliers, manage inventory and otherwise conduct business. We also depend on these systems to respond to customer inquiries, implement our overall internal control processes, maintain records of our property, plant and equipment and record and pay amounts due to vendors and other creditors. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers. As we upgrade or change systems, we may also experience interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality and other unforeseen material issues, which could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins. As a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, cyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in our operations or harm our reputation. Our information technology systems are subject to potential disruptions, including significant network or power outages, cyberattacks, computer viruses, other malicious codes, and/or unauthorized access attempts, any of which, if successful, could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and comply with and implement data security measures, there can be no assurance that any controls and procedures that we have in place will be sufficient to protect us. Further, as cyber threats are continually evolving, our controls and procedures may become inadequate and we may be required to devote additional resources to modify or enhance our systems in the future. We may also be required to expend resources to remediate cyber-related incidents or enhance and strengthen our cyber security. Any such disruptions to our information technology systems, breaches or compromises of data, and/or misappropriation of information could result in violation of privacy and other laws, litigation, fines, negative publicity, lost sales or business delays, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and adversely impact our stock price.\nWe are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any material changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. We have in the past experienced, and in the future may experience again, material weaknesses and potential problems in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required by the SEC. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting. If we cannot provide financial reports in a timely and reliable manner, or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and our stock price could drop significantly.\nWe are dependent on cash flows from our operating subsidiaries to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.\nWe do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests of our operating subsidiaries. Our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our obligations or to pay dividends, if any, is highly dependent on the earnings of, and receipt of funds from, our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans, in particular from MacDermid. As a result, we are dependent on the income generated by our subsidiaries, and to some degree on our ability to repatriate earnings from our foreign operations effectively, to meet our debt service obligations, expenses and operating cash requirements or to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock. For example, the amount of dividends, if any, which may be paid to us by our subsidiaries depends on many factors, including our subsidiaries' results of operations and financial condition, limits on dividends or otherwise under applicable law and their constitutional documents, documents governing their indebtedness, and other factors which may be outside our control. If our subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or if we are unable to repatriate earnings effectively, we may be unable to service our debt obligations, pay our expenses and/or meet our operating cash requirements or to make future dividend payments or shares repurchases, if any.\nWe are governed by Delaware law, which has anti-takeover implications.\nWe are governed by Delaware law, the application of which may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts or a change in control. In particular, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. A Delaware corporation may opt out of that provision either with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or in an amendment to its certificate of incorporation or by-laws approved by its stockholders. We have not opted out of this provision. Section 203 could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us, which may negatively affect our stock price.", "PERMNO": 14406, "SIC": 2890, "TIC": "ESI"}
