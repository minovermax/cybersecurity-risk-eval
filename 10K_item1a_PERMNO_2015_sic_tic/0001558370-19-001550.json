{"cik": "1641614", "company": "CPI Card Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur outstanding indebtedness may impact our business and our results of operations and may restrict our ability to grow; the covenants and restrictions of our credit facility and other loans could make it difficult or impossible to timely make our debt service payments or refinance our debt when it comes due.\nWe maintain a substantial amount of debt, and we may incur additional debt in the future to help fund our business. Our substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations in other areas of our business, including for working capital, expanding our infrastructure, capital expenditures and other general business activities and investment opportunities in our company, because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to pay interest and/or service our debt;\n\u00b7\nimpacting our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition as interest rates rise, as our First Lien Credit Facility is entirely floating rate debt;\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to seek to incur further indebtedness in order to make the capital expenditures and other expenses or investments necessary to operate the business to the extent our future cash flows are insufficient;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to retain existing customers and/or attract new customers due to the significant amount of debt and the related implications of such debt;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and the execution of our strategy, and other expenses or investments planned by us;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility and our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, our business and our industry;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness (which could result in an event of default and acceleration if we fail to comply with the requirements of our indebtedness);\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally;\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to timely make our debt service payments;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability, or increasing the costs, to refinance indebtedness, when our Revolving Credit Facility matures on August 17, 2020 and our First Lien Term Loan matures on August 17, 2022;\n\u00b7\nlimiting access to supply chain and vendor terms, and\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally.\nIn addition, the terms of our First Lien Credit Facility restrict, and covenants contained in agreements governing indebtedness in the future may restrict, our ability to operate our business and to pursue our business strategies. Among other things, our First Lien Credit Facility restricts our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional debt or contingent liabilities;\n\u00b7\ndeclare or pay dividends, redeem stock, or make other distributions to stockholders;\n\u00b7\nmake loans, advances, guarantees or other investments;\n\u00b7\ncreate liens or use assets as security in other transactions;\n\u00b7\nmerge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7\nenter into certain asset sale transactions or other dispositions of assets.\nOur failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Facility. Moreover, these restrictions, as well as the limitations described above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness as they become due, or if we are unable to pay our interest obligations we would be rendered insolvent.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited.\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of new equity securities, debt or a combination of both. As a result of our financial condition, additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our capital requirements. Any failure to achieve adequate funding will delay our product and services innovation and development and could lead to abandonment of one or more of our strategic initiatives. Any of these events could materially harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, and cyber-attacks could compromise our proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations, harm perception of our products, and expose us to litigation and/or regulatory penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nIn operating a Financial Payment Card business, we manage large amounts of personally identifiable information of cardholders, including cardholder names, account numbers and similar information. The reliability and security of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) infrastructure and our ability to protect sensitive and confidential information for our customers, which include many financial institutions, is critical to our business. Our handling of such information makes us a potential target of cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions via the Internet, computer viruses, break-ins, malware, phishing attacks, hacking, denial-of-service attacks or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of or access to computer systems (including from internal and external sources). A breach of our security defenses could result in a loss of our intellectual property, the release of sensitive cardholder information, customer or employee personal data, or the loss of production capabilities at one or more of our production facilities. These types of incidents have become more prevalent and pervasive across industries, including in our industry.\nIn addition, our encryption systems are at risk of being breached or decoded. Smart cards are equipped with keys that encrypt and decode messages in order to secure transactions and maintain the confidentiality of data. The security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of the encryption keys and the complexity of the algorithms used to encrypt and decode information. Any significant advances in technology that enable the breach of cryptographic systems, malicious software infiltration or that allow for the exploitation of weaknesses in such systems could result in a decline in the security we are able to provide through this technology. Any material breach of our secured systems could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer trust and confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by system or network disruptions, whether caused by cyber-attacks, security breaches or otherwise, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe protective measures we have implemented to protect against data and security breaches and cyber-attacks may not prevent system or network disruptions and may be insufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future security breaches. We regularly evaluate, assess and test our systems and the controls, processes and practices to protect those systems. The evaluations, assessments and testing identify areas of weakness in, and suggested improvements to, the maturity of our systems, processes, and risk management framework as well as vulnerabilities in those areas that could be attacked and exploited to access and acquire proprietary and confidential information. Although cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access are a high priority for us, our activities and investment may not be deployed quickly enough or successfully protect our system or network against disruptions and may be insufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future security breaches. In addition, as these threats continue to evolve, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nIn addition, we are subject to significant security and privacy regulations. Some state and federal laws impose, or in the future may impose, privacy and security requirements on us. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which will, among other things, require covered companies to provide certain disclosures to California consumers and allow such consumers to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information, when it goes into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA has already been amended and it remains unclear whether it will be further amended or how it will be interpreted. The prospect of new data privacy laws and ambiguity regarding the interpretation of existing laws has resulted in significant uncertainty and compliance costs. Congressional committees have recently held preliminary hearings about the advisability of a federal data privacy law, but it is uncertain whether the U.S. government would adopt such a law and whether it would preempt state data privacy laws. Although we monitor regulatory developments in this area, any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with these requirements could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and require changes to our business practices. Making these changes is, and will likely continue to be, difficult and expensive. Investigations by the regulators of data security laws could also result in the payment of fines and harm our reputation. Private actions by affected individuals or our customers could also result in significant monetary or reputational damage.\nInterruptions in our operations, particularly in our IT systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to execute, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, including the operation of complex IT systems. In addition, a significant portion of the communication between our employees, customers, and suppliers depends on our IT systems. The reliability of our IT infrastructure and software, and our ability to expand and continually update technologies in response to our changing needs, are critical to our business.\nWe depend on data centers and computing infrastructure operated by third parties to serve customers and operate certain aspects of our services. While we control and have access to applications and data that are hosted in these external locations, we do not control the operation of these facilities or in some cases the hardware and infrastructure within them. Any disruption of, interference at, or inability to keep up with our needs for capacity by our third-party data center or hosted infrastructure partners could interrupt our business operations. In addition, any problems faced by our third-party data center operations or hosted infrastructure partners, with the telecommunications network providers with whom we or they contract, or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our customers. Any interruption in our business applications, systems or networks, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, server downtime, facility issues or energy blackouts, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, sales and operating results.\nNot only could we suffer damage to our brand and reputation in the event of a system outage or data loss or interruption, but we may also be liable to third parties, including our customers. Some of our contractual agreements with financial institutions require the payment of penalties if our systems do not meet certain operating standards, and failure to operate in accordance with the standards of one or more of the Payment Card Brands could result in a loss of the certification of our facilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, to successfully operate our business, we must be able to protect our processing and other systems from interruption, including from events that may be beyond our control. We have established certain protective measures in an effort to ensure the continuation of core business operations in the event that normal operations could not be performed due to a catastrophic event. However, these measures may be insufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future disruptions, and any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions in production at one or more of our facilities may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nAny serious disruption at any of our facilities could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses. Our other facilities may not have sufficient capacity, may not have the specialized equipment necessary, may have higher production costs, may take significant time to increase production or may fail to meet our customers\u2019 requirements, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Long-term production disruptions may cause our customers to seek alternative supply which could further adversely affect our profitability.\nAdditionally, a significant amount of certain specialized manufacturing capacity is concentrated in single-site location. Due to the specialized nature of the assets, in the event such a location experiences disruption, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from our other facilities. Accordingly, disruption at a single-site manufacturing operation could significantly impact our ability to supply our customers and could produce severe impact on us.\nIf we fail to meet the continued listing standards of NASDAQ, our common stock may be delisted, which may adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d). As a condition of the continued listing of our common stock, NASDAQ generally requires that, among other requirements, (i) we maintain at least $2.5 million in stockholders equity, or $35.0 million in market capitalization, or $0.5 million in net income from continuing operations, in either the last fiscal year, or two out of the last three fiscal years, and (ii) we maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. As of December 31, 2018, we had $149.6 million in stockholders\u2019 deficit. Our net loss from continuing operations was $14.8 million and $23.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. As of March 4, 2019, our market capitalization was approximately $40.2 million. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the requirements for continued listing of our common stock on NASDAQ. If our common stock is delisted and we are unable to list our common stock on another U.S. national securities exchange, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. We believe our stock would likely remain listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Any delisting from NASDAQ could result in significant material adverse consequences for our stockholders, including limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. Furthermore, if our common stock were delisted it could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and/or result in the loss of confidence by investors, customers, suppliers and employees.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our trade secrets and intellectual property rights against misappropriation or infringement, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property is important to our business. We depend on patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our products, proprietary designs, and technological processes against misappropriation by others. There is no assurance that our existing or future patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Furthermore, we may have difficulty obtaining additional patents and other intellectual property protections in the future. The patents and intellectual property rights that we receive may be insufficient to provide us with meaningful protection or commercial advantage. Moreover, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we provide services.\nOur efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers may not succeed. We actively seek to protect our proprietary rights and trade secrets by engaging in litigation and by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners and controlling access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Nevertheless, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or technologies or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary and may use such information to interfere with our customers. Enforcing our intellectual property rights may also cause us to incur significant costs. These costs and other consequences from the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIrrespective of our intellectual property rights, we may be required to defend against alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as suppliers or customers. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party.\nCompanies in our industry aggressively protect their intellectual property rights. From time to time, we receive notices or are named in litigation that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 proprietary rights or that challenge the validity of our patents. In addition to the costs and distraction that result from intellectual property litigation, an adverse determination in these types of disputes could prevent us from offering some of our products and services or from enforcing our intellectual property rights. Settlements can involve royalty or other payments that could reduce our profit margins and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Our\nsuppliers, customers and licensors may not be required to fully indemnify us for the costs of defending against infringement claims. In addition, we may be required to indemnify some customers and strategic partners related to allegations, regardless of merit, that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe also face risks related to open source software. Our software may be derived from open source software, which is generally made available to the public by its authors and/or other third parties. Open source software is often made available under licenses, which impose certain obligations in the event we distribute derivative works of the open source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public and/or license such derivative works on terms different from those customarily used to protect our intellectual property. With respect to our proprietary software, we generally license such software under terms that prohibit combining it with open source software. Despite these restrictions, parties may combine our proprietary software with open source software without our authorization, in which case we might nonetheless be required to release the source code of our proprietary software. Usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties, controls on the origin or development of the software, or remedies against the licensors. Many of the risks associated with open source software cannot be eliminated and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience software defects, which could harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability.\nOur services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems, and the software underlying our services may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition, we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems used by our clients. Defects in our software, errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in the interruption of business operations, delays in market acceptance, additional development and remediation costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of clients, negative publicity or exposure to liability claims. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements, we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability.\nOur business could suffer from problems in production quality and process.\nWe produce our products using processes that are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must continually be modified to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce product yields, reduce product quality or interrupt production altogether. As a result of such problems, we may not be able to deliver products, or may be able to deliver products, but in a less timely or cost-effective manner or at a lower than expected quality level, or we may be required to rework or replace products. As the complexity of both our products and our technological processes has become more advanced, production tolerances have been reduced and requirements for precision have become more demanding. If we do not advance our production processes at the market rate, we may experience a lower production quality than the market standard. We may suffer disruptions in our production, either due to production difficulties, such as machinery or technology failures, or as a result of external factors beyond our control, such as delay of, or quality issues with, materials provided by suppliers, interruption of our electrical service or a natural disaster. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to retain our existing customers or identify and attract new customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA substantial portion of our net sales is derived from several large customers. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 39% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our ability to provide products and services to these customers and our other customers and meet very high quality standards in a timely manner is critical to our business success. For example, one of the key services that we offer our customers is the prompt and timely production and delivery of replacement debit or credit cards. Orders for replacement debit or credit cards often are placed on short notice and may require personalization. If we are unable to offer these and our other products and services in a timely manner, our relationships with our customers may be adversely affected and we may lose contracts.\nIn addition, our continued business relationship with our customers may be impacted by several factors beyond our control, including more attractive product offerings from our competitors, pricing pressures or the financial health of these customers, many of whom operate in competitive businesses and depend on favorable macroeconomic conditions. Because our contractual arrangements include neither exclusivity clauses nor commitments to order specified quantities of products on a medium or long-term basis, there is no guarantee that we will be able to renew or win contracts or purchase orders in a given year.\nIf we experience difficulty attracting and retaining customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face competition that may result in a loss of our market share and/or a decline in our profitability.\nOur marketplace is highly competitive, relatively saturated, and increasingly consolidated. We expect these market dynamics to continue as new product markets develop, companies develop lower-cost production processes, our competitors consolidate, and other competitors attempt to enter the markets in which we operate.\nSome of our competitors have larger global customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other capabilities than we do. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new technological requirements and changes in customer and/or regulatory requirements and to leverage their scale to lower production costs and prices. We also face competition from newly established competitors, suppliers of products and customers who choose to develop their own products and services.\nExisting or new competitors may develop products, technologies or services that more effectively address our markets with enhanced features and functionality, greater levels of integration and/or lower cost. As the technological sophistication of our competitors and the size of the market increases, competing low-cost producers could emerge and grow stronger. These dynamics could result in declining average selling prices and reduced gross margins in our businesses. If we cannot sufficiently reduce our production costs or develop new products, technologies or services, we may not be able to compete successfully and we may lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ability to recruit, retain and develop qualified personnel is critical to our success and ability to grow.\nOur business functions are complex and require wide-ranging expertise and intellectual capital. For us to successfully compete and grow, we must retain, recruit and develop personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of our intellectual capital needs. In addition, we must develop our personnel to provide succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital. However, the market for qualified personnel is highly competitive, particularly in the states in which our operations are concentrated. This may result in market increases in compensation. Our efforts to retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Even then, we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. In addition, our key personnel may not continue to be employed or we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Any failure to retain or attract employees or key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to sell, exit or reconfigure businesses or facilities that we determine no longer meet with our strategy or that should be consolidated.\nIn executing our strategy, we have experienced consolidation of certain of our facilities and/or the divestiture of certain of our businesses. We will continue to evaluate such opportunities. Any such consolidation or divestiture could adversely affect our continuing business and expenses, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell non-strategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, if the sale of any non-strategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical, alternative courses of action, including relocation of operations or closure, may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to develop, introduce and commercialize new products, which can be a lengthy and complex process. We may be unable to commercialize new or improved products we may develop on a timely basis, or at all.\nThe development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological, market and industry trends, as well as precise technical execution. The successful development of new products may require us to undertake time-consuming and costly development activities, and we may experience difficulties or challenging market conditions that could delay or prevent the successful development, commercialization and marketing of these new products, including, for example, limited market acceptance of dual-interface EMV technology in the United States. Before we can commercialize any new products, we may need to expend significant funds in order to conduct substantial research and development. If we have difficulty producing innovative products, there could be a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, reputation and business.\nAs we develop products, we may need to make significant investments in product development, as well as sales and marketing resources. Furthermore, if we are unable to develop and introduce new and innovative products in a cost-effective and timely manner, our product and service offerings could be rendered obsolete. In addition, competitors may develop and commercialize competing products faster than we are able to do so. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and financial results may be materially adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, litigation can be costly, and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our business. Furthermore, our insurance may not be adequate to cover claims against us or any liability that may be imposed on us. See Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on our currently pending legal proceedings.\nNew and developing technology solutions and products could make our existing technology solutions and products obsolete or irrelevant, and if we are unable to introduce new products and services in a timely manner, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe markets for our products and services are subject to technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards. In particular, the rise in the adoption in wireless payment systems or mobile payments may make physical cards less attractive as a method of payment. Although to date we have not seen a meaningful reduction in card-based payments in the U.S. resulting from the emergence of mobile payment applications, mobile payments offer consumers an alternative method to make purchases without the need to carry a physical card and could, if widely adopted, reduce the number of Financial Payment Cards issued to consumers. In addition, other new and developing technology solutions and products could make our existing technology solutions and products obsolete or irrelevant.\nOur ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers will significantly affect our future success. We may not be successful in developing, marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands. In addition, we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of these services, or our new services and enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. We continually engage in efforts to innovate and upgrade our products and services. If we do not complete or gain market acceptance of new products, services and technologies, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones. For example, one of our growth opportunities is the potential adoption of dual-interface EMV cards by U.S. card issuing banks. Banks may be delayed in transitioning to the issuance of dual-interface EMV cards due to increased costs and other factors. If these entities do not deploy dual-interface EMV technology or do so less quickly and/or completely than we expect, our ability to grow could be significantly affected which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to develop and deliver new products and services successfully will depend on various factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\neffectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new and emerging product markets;\n\u00b7\ninvest resources in innovation and research and development;\n\u00b7\ncomplete and introduce new products and integrated services solutions in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nlicense any required third-party technology or intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nqualify for and obtain required industry certification for our products;\n\u00b7\ncomply with applicable data protection regulations; and\n\u00b7\nretain and hire talent experienced in developing new products and services\nAdditionally, opportunities to combine or package products and service offerings and the ability to cross-sell products and services are critical to remaining competitive in our industry. As a result, part of our business strategy is to develop new products and services that may be used in conjunction with or in addition to our existing offerings. If we are unable to identify adequate opportunities to cross-sell our products and services, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results are unpredictable and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and annually, and may differ significantly from our expectations.\nOur operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect revenue and profitability or lead to significant variability in our operating results. These factors include, among others, the cyclicality of the financial card and electronic payment industries, capital requirements, inventory management, the availability of funding, competition, new product developments, technological changes, production problems and other factors.\nFurthermore, in periods of industry overcapacity or when our customers encounter difficulties in their end-markets, orders are more exposed to cancellations, reductions, price renegotiations or postponements, which in turn reduce our management\u2019s ability to forecast the next quarter or full-year production levels, net sales, profits and cash flows. For these reasons, our net sales and operating results and cash flows may differ materially from our expectations as visibility is reduced. This may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur long-lived assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize their full value.\nOur long-lived assets recorded as of December 31, 2018 were $121.7 million, representing 59% of our total assets, of which we have recorded plant, equipment and leasehold improvements of $39.1 million, as our operations require significant investments in machinery and equipment.\nWe perform goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis as of October 1 of each year. Other long-lived assets, such as identifiable intangible assets and plant, equipment and leasehold improvements are reviewed for impairment whenever events, changes or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If we were to conclude that an additional future write-down of our long-lived assets is necessary, we would have to record the appropriate charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A write-down of our long-lived assets may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance and a decline in expected future cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.6 million on the long lived assets in our U.K. Limited segment. During the fourth quarter of 2018, based on the goodwill impairment test performed annually as of October 1, there were no other impairment charges necessary. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 7 \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\u201d and Note 4 \u201cDiscontinued Operations and Dispositions\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nOur failure to operate our business in accordance with the standards of the PCI Security Standards Council or other industry standards applicable to our customers, such as Payment Card Brand certification standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany of our customers issue their cards on the networks of the Payment Card Brands that are subject to the standards of the PCI Security Standards Council or other standards and criteria relating to service providers\u2019 and manufacturers\u2019 facilities, products and physical and logical security which we must satisfy in order to be eligible to supply products and services to such customers. Most of our contractual arrangements with our customers may be terminated if we fail to comply with these standards and criteria.\nWe make significant investments to our network of high-security facilities in order to meet these standards and criteria, including investments required to satisfy changes adopted from time to time in their respective standards and criteria. Further investments may be costly, and if we are unable to continue to meet these standards and criteria, we may become ineligible to provide products and services that have constituted in the past an important part of our revenue and profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the vast majority of the products we produced and services we provided were subject to certification with one or more of the Payment Card Brands. If we were to lose our certification from one or more of the Payment Card Brands, Interac (in Canada), or PCI certification for one or more of our facilities, we may lose the ability to produce cards for or provide services to banks issuing credit or debit cards on the networks of the Payment Card Brands. If we are not able to produce cards for or provide services to any or all of the issuers issuing debit or credit cards on such networks, we could lose a substantial number of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA disruption in our operations or supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nAs a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including disruptions or delays in supply chain or information technology, product quality control, as well other external factors over which we have no control. One of the most important components of our products is the EMV microchip. We obtain our components from multiple suppliers located in South Korea, France, the United States and Singapore, primarily on a purchase order basis. Key components for our products include EMV microchips, substrates (such as PVC), modules, antennas, and inlays, which we source from a few key suppliers. Changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities, in compliance with applicable standards, and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business. For example, we have in the past experienced delays in our supply chain, which made it difficult to produce our products in a timely manner. In addition, any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations.\nRisks associated with reduced levels of consumer and business spending could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends heavily on the overall level of consumer and business spending. Our revenue is exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, consumer discretionary income or changes in consumer purchasing habits. A sustained deterioration in general economic condition, particularly in the United States, or increases in interest rates may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the demand for our Financial Payment Card solutions or reduce the purchase of our higher margin products. If a downturn occurs, credit card issuers may reduce credit limits, close accounts, and become more selective with respect to whom they issue credit cards. These and other changes in economic conditions could also adversely impact our future revenues and profits and cause a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCosts relating to product defects, and any related product liability and warranty claims may materially adversely affect our business\nWe offer highly complex services and products and, accordingly, from time to time defects have occurred. Such defects can give rise to significant costs, including expenses relating to recalling products, replacing defective items, writing down defective inventory, the loss of potential sales and claims by third parties. In addition, the occurrence of such defects may give rise to product liability and warranty claims, including liability for damages caused\nby such defects. If we sell defective products into the market, our reputation could suffer and we may lose sales opportunities and incur liability for damages, including damage claims from customers in excess of the amounts they pay us for our products, including consequential damages. In addition, our customers may recall their products if they prove to be defective or make compensatory payments in accordance with industry or business practice or in order to maintain good customer relationships. If such a recall or payment is caused by a defect in one of our products, our customers may seek to recover all or a portion of their losses from us. If any of these risks materialize, our reputation would be harmed and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the U.S. government puts significant tariffs or other restrictions on goods imported into the United States, our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nMost of our chips, as well as certain other raw materials, are imported from companies located outside of the United States. The U.S. government has already imposed tariffs on imports from certain countries and may impose further tariffs and/or trade restrictions. The current U.S. administration has also expressed antipathy towards certain existing international trade agreements. Any of these factors could depress economic activity, restrict our access to suppliers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThese tariffs are subject to a number of uncertainties as they are implemented, including future adjustments and changes to the products covered by additional tariffs and to the countries included or excluded from such tariffs. The ultimate reaction of other countries, and the impact of these tariffs or other actions on the United States and our business, financial condition and results of operations, cannot be predicted at this time, nor can we predict the impact of any other developments with respect to global trade.\nWe may become subject to additional sales tax collection obligations and claims for uncollected amounts.\nIn recent years, a number of states have adopted or considered adopting legislation requiring out-of-state sellers to collect and remit sales tax on sales transactions into those states where they have no physical presence. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s June 2018 decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. significantly increased the ability of states to impose sales tax collection responsibilities on out-of-state sellers. The ruling is widely expected to result in an increased number of states seeking to expand the applicability of their own laws regarding sales tax \u201cnexus.\u201d If this occurs, we could become subject to additional costs and administrative requirements to collect and remit sales tax in additional jurisdictions. Further, we may be subject to the retroactive assessment of state or local sales taxes in certain jurisdictions. Such assessments may adversely affect our future cash flow and financial results.\nWe rely on licensing arrangements in production and other fields, and actions taken by any of our licensing partners could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany of our products integrate third-party technologies that we license or otherwise obtain the right to use, including software relating to smart card operating systems used in products such as EMV cards. As part of our strategy, we have entered into licensing agreements with other leading industry participants that provide us with, among other benefits, access to technology owned by third parties. For example, we license Java card technology from Oracle and Multos card technology from Multos International, a subsidiary of a competitor, for use in certain of our products, including in EMV cards. This Java and Multos card technology provides a secure environment for applications on smart cards and other devices with limited memory and processing capabilities, and we rely on our commercial arrangements with Oracle and Multos International for the continued use of these platforms. Oracle and Multos International may not continue to renew their licenses with us on similar terms or at all, which could negatively impact our net sales. We have also entered into cross-licensing agreements with certain of our competitors that provide for an exchange of intellectual property, including the sharing of certain patent rights in our respective portfolios. If we are unable to continue to successfully renew these agreements, we may lose our access to certain technologies that we rely upon to develop certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are required to comply with complex laws and regulations in the United States and other countries and are exposed to business risks associated with our international operations.\nWe are subject to numerous evolving and complex laws and regulations which apply, among other things, to financial reporting standards, corporate governance, data privacy, tax, trade regulations, environmental regulations and\npermit requirements, export controls, competitive practices, and labor and health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate. There are a number of risks associated with international business operations, including political instability (e.g., the threat of war, terrorist attacks or civil unrest), inconsistent regulations across jurisdictions, unanticipated changes in the regulatory environment, and import and export restrictions. Any of these events may affect our employees, reputation, business or financial results as well as our ability to meet our objectives.\nWe may not be in full compliance at all times with the laws and regulations to which we are subject and we may not have obtained the permits, authorizations, or licenses that we need. Any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines or sanctions. In such a case, or if any of these international business risks were to materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations expose us to liability and any such liability may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate. Such regulations govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, and the health and safety of our employees. For example, our products and the raw materials we use in our production processes are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We may not be able to be at all times, in full compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.\nAs with other companies engaged in similar activities or that own or operate real property, we face inherent risks of environmental liability at our current and historical production facilities. Certain environmental laws impose strict and, in certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of the investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. In addition, we may discover new facts or conditions that may change our expectations or be faced with changes in environmental laws or their enforcement that would increase our liabilities. Furthermore, our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, regulated materials, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe scientific examination of, political attention to, and rules and regulations on issues surrounding the existence and extent of climate change may result in an increase in our cost of production due to increases in the price of energy and/or the introduction of energy or carbon taxes. A variety of regulatory developments have been introduced that focus on restricting or managing the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gasses. Companies such as ours may need to purchase at higher costs new equipment or raw materials with lower carbon footprints. These developments and further legislation that is likely to be enacted could negatively affect our operations. Changes in environmental regulations could increase our production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur majority stockholders have the ability to control significant corporate activities\nTricor Pacific Capital Partners (Fund IV), Limited Partnership and Tricor Pacific Capital Partners (Fund IV) US, Limited Partnership (collectively, the \u201cTricor Funds\u201d), affiliated with Parallel49 Equity (formerly known as Tricor Pacific Capital), own approximately 37% and 22% of our common stock, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. As a result of their ownership, the Tricor Funds, so long as they collectively hold a majority of our outstanding shares, will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and, through our board of directors, the ability to control decision-making with respect to our business direction and policies. Matters over which the Tricor Funds, directly or indirectly, exercise control include:\n\u00b7\nelection of directors;\n\u00b7\nmergers and other business combination transactions, including proposed transactions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium price for their shares;\n\u00b7\nother acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of equity securities;\n\u00b7\nrepurchases of stock and payment of dividends; and\n\u00b7\nthe issuance of shares to management under our incentive plans.\nTricor Funds may divest all or some of their ownership of our common stock at any time, either through sale on the open market or through a distribution to the participants in the funds. If Tricor Funds or the participants in the funds cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.\nConflicts of interest may arise because directors who are principals of our largest stockholder constitute a substantial portion of our board of directors.\nMessrs. Bradley Seaman and Nicholas Peters, who are officers or affiliates of Parallel49 Equity (and its predecessor), serve on our board of directors. The Tricor Funds, our majority stockholders, are funds controlled by Parallel49 Equity and its affiliates. Parallel49 Equity and entities controlled by it may in the future hold equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us, and companies in which it currently invests may begin directly or indirectly competing with us. As a result of these relationships, when conflicts between the interests of Parallel49 Equity, on the one hand, and of other stockholders, on the other hand, arise, these directors may not be disinterested. Although our directors and officers have a duty of loyalty to us under Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, transactions that we enter into in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest are generally permissible so long as (1) the material facts relating to the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our board of directors and a majority of our disinterested directors approves the transaction, (2) the material facts relating to the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our stockholders and a majority of our disinterested stockholders approve the transaction or (3) the transaction is otherwise fair to us. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that any principal, officer, member, manager and/or employee of Parallel49 Equity or any entity that controls, is controlled by or under common control with Parallel49 Equity (other than any company that is controlled by us) or any investment funds managed by Parallel49 Equity will not be required to offer any transaction opportunity of which they become aware to us and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is offered to them solely in their capacities as our directors.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents and other contractual provisions may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage hostile takeover attempts that some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. The provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include, among other things, the following:\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u00b7\nfollowing the time that the Tricor Funds and their affiliates cease to beneficially own a majority of our common stock, stockholder action may only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent, and special meetings may only be called by a majority of the total number of directors that we would have if there were no vacancies on our board of directors\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings\n\u00b7\nallowing only our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors; and\n\u00b7\nfollowing the time that the Tricor Funds and their affiliates cease to beneficially own a majority of our common stock, super-majority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation\nWe have entered into a director nomination agreement (the \u201cDirector Nomination Agreement\u201d) with the Tricor Funds that provides the Tricor Funds the right to designate nominees for election to our board of directors for so long as the Tricor Funds collectively beneficially own 5% or more of the total number of shares of our common stock then outstanding. The number of nominees that the Tricor Funds are entitled to designate under the Director Nomination Agreement bears the same proportion to the total number of members of our board of directors as the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the Tricor Funds bears to the total number of shares of common stock outstanding, rounded up to the nearest whole number. In addition, the Tricor Funds are entitled to designate the replacement for any of its board designees whose board service terminates prior to the end of such designee\u2019s term regardless of the Tricor Funds\u2019 beneficial ownership at such time. The Tricor Funds also have the right to have their designees participate on committees of our board of directors, subject to compliance with applicable law and stock exchange rules. The Director Nomination Agreement will terminate when the Tricor Funds collectively own less than 5% of our outstanding common stock.\nWe have elected in our certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination, such as a merger, with a person or group owning 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, we will not be subject to any anti-takeover effects of Section 203. However, our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203, except that they provide that the Tricor Funds, their affiliates (including any investment funds managed by Tricor) and any person that becomes an interested stockholder as a result of a transfer of 5% or more of our voting stock by the forgoing persons to such person are excluded from the \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d definition in our certificate of incorporation and are therefore not subject to the restrictions set forth therein that have the same effect as Section 203.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors, they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, the potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us or discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price.\nIn addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nAny issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance or issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15793, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "PMTS"}
