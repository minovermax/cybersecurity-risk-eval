{"cik": "1666700", "company": "DuPont de Nemours, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company's operations could be affected by various risks, many of which are beyond its control. Based on current information, the Company believes that the following identifies the most material risk factors that could affect its operations. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Relating to the N&B Transaction and the Dow and Corteva Distributions\nThe separation and combination of DuPont\u2019s Nutrition & Biosciences business with IFF could result in significant tax liability to DuPont.\nFollowing the N&B Merger, N&B is expected to merge with and into Neptune Merger Sub II LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of IFF) (\u201cMerger Sub II\u201d), with Merger Sub II surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of IFF (the \u201cSecond Merger,\u201d and together with the N&B Merger, the \u201cMergers\u201d).\nThe distribution by DuPont to its stockholders of all the issued and outstanding shares of N&B through the Exchange Offer (\"N&B Distribution\") and Mergers are expected to be tax-free to DuPont stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes (except to the extent that cash is paid to DuPont stockholders in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement), and the N&B Contribution, N&B Distribution, and Special Cash Payment are expected to result in no recognition of gain or loss by DuPont for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nDuPont has received an opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP regarding (i) the qualification of the separation and transfer by DuPont of its N&B Business (the \"N&B Contribution\"), N&B Distribution, and Special Cash Payment as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Sections 368(a), 361 and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \u201cCode\u201d), (ii) the nonrecognition of gain or loss by DuPont on receipt of the Special Cash Payment (subject to certain conditions), (iii) the qualification of the N&B Distribution as a distribution described in Section 355 and to which Section 355(e) does not apply and (iv) the qualification of the Mergers as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. This opinion is based upon and rely on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of DuPont, N&B, IFF and Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub II. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant transaction documents, the opinion may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. Notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) could determine that the separation of DuPont\u2019s Nutrition & Biosciences business should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position.\nDuPont has also obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain matters impacting the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the N&B Contribution, N&B Distribution, Special Cash Payment and certain related transactions. The conclusions of the IRS private letter ruling were based, among other things, on various factual assumptions DuPont authorized and representations DuPont made to the IRS. If any of assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on the IRS private letter ruling may be affected.\nIf the N&B Contribution and N&B Distribution failed to qualify for the treatment described above, DuPont would be required to generally recognize taxable gain on the transactions and stockholders of DuPont who receive N&B Common Stock (and subsequently, IFF Common Stock) would be subject to tax on their receipt of the N&B Common Stock. Additionally, if the Special Cash Payment or certain internal transactions related to the separation of the Nutrition & Biosciences business fail to qualify for their intended tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state, local tax and/or foreign tax law, DuPont could incur additional tax liabilities.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement by and between DuPont with N&B and IFF, N&B or IFF is generally be required to indemnify DuPont for any taxes resulting from the separation of the Nutrition & Biosciences business (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) certain actions taken by N&B or IFF involving the capital stock of N&B or IFF or any assets of the N&B group (excluding actions required by the documents governing the proposed transactions), or (ii) any breach of certain representations and covenants made by N&B or IFF.\nDuPont is subject to continuing contingent tax-related liabilities of Dow and Corteva following the separations and DWDP Distributions.\nAfter the separations and DWDP Distributions, there are several significant areas where the liabilities of Dow and Corteva may become the Company\u2019s obligations, either in whole or in part. For example, to the extent that any subsidiary of the Company\nwas included in the consolidated tax reporting group of either TDCC or EID for any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the DWDP Merger, such subsidiary is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group of TDCC or EID, as applicable, for such taxable period. In connection with the separations and DWDP Distributions, DuPont, Dow and Corteva have entered into a Tax Matters Agreement, as amended, that allocates the responsibility for prior period consolidated taxes among Dow, Corteva and DuPont. If Dow or Corteva are unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, however, DuPont could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state, local, or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\nIn connection with the separations and DWDP Distributions, certain liabilities are allocated to or retained by DuPont through assumption or indemnification of Dow and/or Corteva, as applicable. If DuPont is required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities to Dow and/or Corteva, DuPont may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, and the Company\u2019s financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, certain liabilities are allocated to or retained by Dow and/or Corteva through assumption or indemnification, or subject to indemnification by other third parties. These indemnities may not be sufficient to insure the Company against the full amount of liabilities, including PFAS Stray Liabilities, allocated to or retained by it, and Dow, Corteva and/or third parties may not be able to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the DWDP Separation and Distribution Agreement, the DWDP Employee Matters Agreement, and the DWDP Tax Matters Agreement, as amended, (collectively, the \u201cCore Agreements\u201d) with Dow and Corteva, as well as the Letter Agreement between DuPont and Corteva, DuPont has agreed to assume, and indemnify Dow and Corteva for, certain liabilities. (See discussion of the Core Agreements in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Litigation and Environmental Matters in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, particularly indemnities relating to the Company\u2019s actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the distributions. Third parties could also seek to hold it responsible for any of the liabilities allocated to Dow and Corteva, including those related to EID\u2019s materials science and/or agriculture businesses, or for the conduct of such businesses prior to the distributions, and such third parties could seek damages, other monetary penalties (whether civil or criminal) and/or other remedies. Additionally, DuPont generally assumes and is responsible for the payment of the Company\u2019s share of (i) certain liabilities of DowDuPont relating to, arising out of or resulting from certain general corporate matters of DuPont and (ii) certain separation expenses not otherwise allocated to Corteva or Dow (or allocated specifically to it) pursuant to the Core Agreements, and third parties could seek to hold it responsible for Dow\u2019s or Corteva\u2019s share of any such liabilities. Dow and/or Corteva, as applicable, have agreed to indemnify it for such liabilities; however, such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect it against the full amount of such liabilities or from other remedies, and Dow and/or Corteva, as applicable, may not be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. Even if DuPont ultimately succeeds in recovering from Dow and/or Corteva, as applicable, any amounts for which DuPont are held liable, DuPont may be temporarily required to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGenerally, as described in Litigation and Environmental Matters, losses related from liabilities related to discontinued and/or divested operations and businesses of EID that are not primarily related to its agriculture business or specialty products business, (\u201cStray Liabilities\u201d), are allocated to or shared by each of Corteva and DuPont. Stray Liabilities include liabilities arising out of actions to the extent related to or resulting from EID\u2019s development, testing, manufacture or sale of per- or polyfluoroalkyl substances, (\u201cPFAS Stray Liabilities\u201d).\nAlthough the Company believes it is remote, there can be no assurance that any such third party would have adequate resources to satisfy its indemnification obligation when due, or, would not ultimately be successful in claiming defenses against payment. Even if recovery from the third party is ultimately successful, DuPont may be temporarily required to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the risk factor below regarding the DuPont, Corteva and Chemours cost sharing arrangement related to future eligible PFAS liabilities.\nIf the completed distribution of Corteva or Dow, in each case, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then the Company could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability.\nThe completed distributions of Corteva and Dow were each conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, the Company\u2019s tax counsel, regarding the qualification of the applicable distribution along with certain related transactions as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode,\u201d and such opinions, collectively, the \u201cTax Opinions\u201d). The Tax Opinions relied on certain facts, assumptions, and undertakings, and certain representations from the Company, Dow and Corteva, as applicable, as well\nas the IRS Ruling (as defined below). Notwithstanding the Tax Opinions and the IRS Ruling, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) could determine on audit that either, or both, of the distributions and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the Tax Opinions.\nEven if a distribution otherwise constituted a tax-free transaction to stockholders under Section 355 of the Code, the Company could be required to recognize corporate level tax on such distribution and certain related transactions under Section 355(e) of the Code if the IRS determines that, as a result of the DWDP Merger or other transactions considered part of a plan with such distribution, there was a 50 percent or greater change in ownership in the Company, Dow or Corteva, as relevant. In connection with the DWDP Merger, the Company sought and received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding the proper time, manner and methodology for measuring common ownership in the stock of the Company, EID and TDCC for purposes of determining whether there was a 50 percent or greater change of ownership under Section 355(e) of the Code as a result of the DWDP Merger (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d). The Tax Opinions relied on the continued validity of the IRS Ruling and representations made by the Company as to the common ownership of the stock of TDCC and EID immediately prior to the DWDP Merger, and concluded that there was not a 50 percent or greater change of ownership for purposes of Section 355(e) as a result of the DWDP Merger. Notwithstanding the Tax Opinions and the IRS Ruling, the IRS could determine that a distribution or a related transaction should nevertheless be treated as a taxable transaction to the Company if it determines that any of the Company\u2019s facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings was not correct or that a distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions in the Tax Opinions that are not covered by the IRS Ruling.\nGenerally, corporate taxes resulting from the failure of a distribution to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be imposed on the Company. Under the DWDP Tax Matters Agreement, as amended, that the Company entered into with Dow and Corteva, Dow and Corteva are generally obligated to indemnify the Company against any such taxes imposed on it. However, if a distribution fails to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes for certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the DWDP Merger and the distributions, then under the DWDP Tax Matters Agreement, as amended, the Company and Corteva, on the one hand, and Dow, on the other hand, would share the tax liability resulting from such failure in accordance with the relative equity values of the Company and Dow on the first full trading day following the distribution of Dow, and the Company and Corteva would in turn share any such resulting tax liability in accordance with the relative equity values of the Company and Corteva on the first full trading day following the distribution of Corteva. Furthermore, under the terms of the DWDP Tax Matters Agreement, as amended, a party also generally will be responsible for any taxes imposed on the other parties that arise from the failure of either distribution to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to such party, or such party's affiliates\u2019, stock, assets or business, or any breach of such party's representations made in connection with the IRS Ruling or in any representation letter provided to a tax advisor in connection with certain tax opinions, including the Tax Opinions, regarding the tax-free status of the distributions and certain related transactions. To the extent that the Company is responsible for any liability under the DWDP Tax Matters Agreement, as amended, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nThe DWDP separations and DWDP Distributions and the N&B Transaction may expose the Company to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nAlthough in connection with the DWDP Distributions and in connection with the N&B Transaction DuPont received separate solvency opinions from investment banks confirming that DuPont, Dow, Corteva and N&B would each be adequately capitalized following the separations and DWDP Distributions, and the N&B Transactions as relevant, (the \u201cTransactions\u201d), the Transactions could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. Any unpaid creditor could claim that DuPont did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in any of the Transactions and that any one or the aggregate of the Transactions left DuPont insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that DuPont intended or believed DuPont would incur debts beyond the Company\u2019s ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the separations and distributions as a fraudulent transfer or impose substantial liabilities on it, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Transactions are also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (i) out of its surplus (net assets minus capital) or (ii) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal\nyear. Although DuPont\u2019s Board of Directors made the distributions out of DuPont\u2019s surplus and received an opinion that DuPont had adequate surplus under Delaware law to declare the dividends of Corteva and Dow common stock in connection with the DWDP Distributions there can be no assurance that a court will not later determine that some or all of the distributions were unlawful.\nOn January 22, 2021, DuPont, Corteva and Chemours entered into a cost sharing arrangement related to future eligible PFAS costs. The Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies, including expected performance under and impact of the cost sharing arrangement.\nAlthough by reducing uncertainty, the Company expects to benefit from the cost sharing arrangement related to future PFAS eligible costs, achievement of any such benefits may not be realized and depend on a number of factors and uncertainties that include, but are not limited to: the achievement, terms and conditions of final agreements related to the cost sharing arrangement; the outcome of any pending or future litigation related to PFAS or PFOA, including personal injury claims and natural resource damages claims; the extent and cost of ongoing remediation obligations and potential future remediation obligations; changes in laws and regulations applicable to PFAS chemicals; the performance by each of the parties of their respective obligations under the cost sharing arrangement.\nDuPont faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters, including product liability, patent infringement and other intellectual property disputes, contract and commercial litigation, claims for damage or personal injury, antitrust claims, governmental regulations and other actions. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, DuPont may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses, and DuPont may issue guarantees of third-party obligations. If DuPont is required to make payments as a result, they could exceed the amounts accrued therefor, thereby adversely affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nRisks Relating to DuPont\u2019s Business and Results of Operations\nThe extent to which the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and measures taken in response to it, impact DuPont\u2019s business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nDuPont is actively monitoring the global impacts of COVID-19, including the impacts from responsive measures, and remains focused on its top priorities - the safety and health of its employees and the needs of its customers. The Company\u2019s business and financial condition, and the business and financial condition of the company\u2019s customers and suppliers, have been impacted by the significantly increased economic and demand uncertainties created by the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, public and private sector responsive measures, such as the imposition of travel restrictions, quarantines, adoption of remote working, and suspension of non-essential business and government services, have impacted the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. Many of DuPont\u2019s facilities and employees are based in areas impacted by the virus. While most DuPont manufacturing sites remain in operation, DuPont has reduced or furloughed certain operations in response to government measures, employee welfare concerns and the impact of COVID-19 on the global demand and supply chain. DuPont\u2019s manufacturing operations may be further adversely affected by impacts from COVID-19 including, among other things, additional government actions and other responsive measures, more and /or deeper supply chain disruptions, quarantines and health and availability of essential onsite personnel. In response, the Company developed site-by-site protocols in 2020 under which the Company continues to operate. These protocols include pre-entrance screening, restricting visitor access, social distancing and masking requirements, additional sanitization and disinfecting requirements, restrictions on all nonessential travel and implementation of work-from-home protocols. The suspension of travel and doing business in-person has increased the Company\u2019s exposure to cybersecurity risks and could negatively impact the Company's innovation and marketing efforts, challenge the ability to deliver against the Company\u2019s strategic priorities and to otherwise transact business in a timely manner, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm DuPont\u2019s business. Furthermore, COVID-19 continues to adversely impact the broader global economy, including negatively impacting economic growth and creating disruption and volatility in the global financial and capital markets, which could result in increases in the cost of capital and/or adversely impact the availability of and access to capital, which could negatively affect DuPont\u2019s liquidity. DuPont is unable to predict the extent of COVID-19 related impacts on its business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition which depends on highly uncertain and unpredictable future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. DuPont\u2019s financial results may be materially and adversely impacted by a variety of factors that have not yet been determined, including potential impairments of goodwill and other assets. DuPont is taking actions, including reducing costs, restructuring actions, and delaying certain capital expenditures and non-essential spend. In addition, the Company may consider further reductions in or furloughing additional operations in response to further and/or deeper declines in demand and/or or supply chain disruptions. There can be no guaranty that such actions will significantly mitigate the\nimpact of COVID-19 on the company\u2019s business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity or financial condition. After the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, DuPont may experience materially adverse impacts to its business, results of operations and financial condition as a result of related global economic impacts, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nSupply chain disruptions and volatility in energy and raw material costs could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s sales and earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing processes depend on the continued availability of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including potential legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating a carbon tax or implementing a cap and trade program which could create increases in energy costs and price volatility. Supply chain disruptions, plant and/or power outages, labor disputes and/or strikes, geo-political activity, weather events and natural disasters, including hurricanes or flooding that impact coastal regions, and global health risks or pandemics could seriously harm the Company\u2019s operations as well as the operations of the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers. In addition, the Company\u2019 suppliers may experience capacity limitations in their own operations or may elect to reduce or eliminate certain product lines. To address this risk, generally, the Company seeks to have many sources of supply for key raw materials in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. In addition, and where the supply market for key raw materials is concentrated, DuPont takes additional steps to manage its exposure to supply chain risk and price fluctuations through, among other things, negotiated long-term contracts some which include minimum purchase obligations. Although there can be no assurance that such mitigation efforts will prevent future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of certain raw materials, DuPont believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of key raw materials\nDuPont also takes actions to offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through selling price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction programs. Success in offsetting higher raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served. As a result, volatility in these costs may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by interruption of the Company\u2019s information technology or network systems and other business disruptions.\nDuPont relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed or accessible by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to otherwise manage or support its business. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls.\nInformation technology system and/or network disruptions, whether caused by acts of sabotage, employee error, malfeasance or other actions, could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operations as well as the operations of the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers. Other business disruptions may also be caused by security breaches, which could include, for example, attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers, viruses, breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other actions or other disruptions. DuPont and/or the Company\u2019s suppliers may fail to effectively prevent, detect and recover from these or other security breaches and, therefore, such breaches could result in misuse of the Company\u2019s assets, loss of property including trade secrets and confidential or personal information, some of which is subject to privacy and security laws, and other business disruptions. As a result, DuPont may be subject to legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, loss of sales, interference with regulatory compliance which could result in sanctions or penalties, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in the Company\u2019s operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nLike most major corporations, DuPont is the target of industrial espionage, including cyber-attacks, from time to time. DuPont is experiencing an increase in attempts to breach its information technology systems, including in conjunction with implementation of work-from-home protocols adopted in response to COVID-19. These cyber-security threats include phishing, spam emails, hacking, social engineering, and malicious software. DuPont has determined that these attacks have resulted, and could result in the future, in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information. Although management does not believe that DuPont has experienced any material losses to date related to these security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that DuPont will not suffer such losses in the future.\nDuPont seeks to actively manage the risks within the Company\u2019s control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, DuPont may be required to expend significant\nresources to enhance the Company\u2019s control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEnforcing the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, or defending against intellectual property claims asserted by others, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIntellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information, trademarks, tradenames and other forms of trade dress, are important to the Company\u2019s business. DuPont endeavors to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which the Company\u2019s products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which the Company\u2019s products are imported. However, DuPont may be unable to obtain protection for the Company\u2019s intellectual property in key jurisdictions. Further, changes in government policies and regulations, including changes made in reaction to pressure from non-governmental organizations, or the public generally, could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions.\nDuPont has designed and implemented internal controls intended to restrict access to and distribution of the Company\u2019s intellectual property. Despite these precautions, the Company\u2019s intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions, theft and cybersecurity incidents, and other security breaches. When unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered, DuPont considers the matter for report to governmental authorities for investigation, as appropriate, and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact. Protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be self-replicating. Accordingly, the impact of such theft can be significant.\nCompetitors are increasingly challenging the Company\u2019s intellectual property positions, and the potential outcomes can be highly uncertain. Third parties may also claim the Company\u2019s products violate their intellectual property rights. Defending such claims, even those without merit, is time-consuming and expensive. In addition, as a result of such claims, DuPont has and could be required in the future to enter into license agreements, develop non-infringing products or engage in litigation that could be costly. If challenges are resolved adversely, it could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms, commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products.\nIn addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change, the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions and/or the uncertainty in predicting the outcome of complex proceedings relating to ownership or the scope of protection of patents relating to certain emerging technologies, competitors may be unexpectedly issued patents that DuPont does not anticipate. These patents could reduce the value of the Company\u2019s commercial or pipeline products or, to the extent they cover key technologies on which DuPont has unknowingly relied, require it to seek to obtain licenses or cease using the technology, no matter how valuable to the Company\u2019s business. If DuPont decided to obtain licenses to continue using the technology, it cannot ensure DuPont would be able to obtain such a license on acceptable terms.\nLegislation and jurisprudence on patent protection is evolving, and changes in laws could affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for the Company\u2019s products.\nAny one or more of the above factors could significantly affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAn impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nAt least annually, DuPont must assess both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. If testing indicates that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, their carrying values will be written down based on fair values with a charge against earnings. Where DuPont utilizes discounted cash flow methodologies in determining fair values, continued weak demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment. Accordingly, any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAs a result of the DWDP Merger and related acquisition method of accounting, EID\u2019s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value, and any declines in projected cash flows could have a material, negative impact on the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting units and assets. Future impairments of the Company\u2019s goodwill or intangible assets also could be recorded due to changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances and the magnitude of such impairments may be material to it.\nFailure to effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances and other portfolio actions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDuPont continuously evaluates acquisition candidates, including significant transactions, that may strategically fit the Company\u2019s business and/or growth objectives. If DuPont is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, DuPont could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings, including any expected increases in revenues and operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results. DuPont expects to continually review the Company\u2019s portfolio of assets for contributions to the Company\u2019s objectives and alignment with the Company\u2019s growth strategy. The Letter Agreement between the Company and Corteva limits DuPont\u2019s ability to separate certain businesses and assets to third parties without assigning certain of its indemnification obligations under the DWDP Separation and Distribution Agreement to the transferee of such businesses and assets or meeting certain other alternative conditions. DuPont may be unable to meet the conditions under the Letter Agreement, if applicable. Even if the conditions under the Letter Agreement are met or are not applicable, DuPont may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets, and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect the Company\u2019s earnings. Moreover, DuPont might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce the Company\u2019s earnings. In addition, if the execution or implementation of acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful and/or the Company fails to effectively manage its cost as its portfolio evolves, it could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFailure to maintain a streamlined operating model and sustain operational improvements may reduce the Company\u2019s profitability or adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability and margin growth will depend in part on the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a streamlined operating model and drive sustainable improvements, through actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. A variety of factors may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to realize the targeted cost synergies, including failure to successfully optimize the Company\u2019s facilities footprint, the failure to take advantage of the Company\u2019s global supply chain, the failure to identify and eliminate duplicative programs. There can be no assurance that DuPont is be able to achieve or sustain any or all of the cost savings generated from restructuring actions.\nFailure to attract and retain talented people with the necessary knowledge and experience could adversely affect Company\u2019s ability to compete and achieve its strategic goals.\nAttracting, developing, and retaining talented employees is essential to the Company\u2019s successful delivery of products and services, ability to innovate, including developing new products and technologies, and ability to identify trends and develop new markets.\nCompetition for employees can be intense. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate, motivate and reward its employees, it may not be able to retain them or attract new employee in the future which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to effectively compete.\nRisks Relating to Capital Resources and Liquidity\nChanges in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase the Company\u2019s cost of borrowing or restrict the Company\u2019s ability to access debt capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit ratings are important to the Company\u2019s cost of capital.\nDuPont relies on access to the debt capital markets and other short-term borrowings to finance the Company\u2019s long-term and day-to-day operations. A decrease in the ratings assigned to it by the ratings agencies may negatively impact the Company\u2019s access to the debt capital markets and increase the Company\u2019s cost of borrowing. The major rating agencies will routinely evaluate the Company\u2019s credit profile and assign debt ratings to it. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include weighing the Company\u2019s financial strength versus business, industry and financial risk. The addition of further leverage to the Company\u2019s capital structure could impact the Company\u2019s credit ratings. Failure to maintain an investment grade rating at the Company\u2019s current level would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost of funding and the Company\u2019s results of operations and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and access to the capital markets. Any limitation on the Company\u2019s ability to continue to raise money in the debt capital markets could have a substantial negative effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity. If DuPont is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, including from significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it could restrict the Company\u2019s current operations, activities under its current and future stock buyback programs, and the Company\u2019s growth opportunities, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nA significant percentage of the Company\u2019s net sales are generated from the Company\u2019s international operations and are subject to economic, foreign exchange and other risks.\nDuPont does business globally in about 60 countries. The percentage of net sales generated by the international operations of DuPont, including U.S. exports, was approximately 70 percent of net sales on a continuing operations basis for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. With Asia Pacific as the Company\u2019s largest region, DuPont expects the percentage of the Company\u2019s net sales derived from international operations to continue to be significant. Risks related to international operations include:\n\u2022exchange control regulations\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign exchange rates\n\u2022foreign investment laws\nThe Company\u2019s international operations expose it to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. For its continuing operations as of the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s largest currency exposures are the European euro, Chinese renminbi, and Japanese yen. U.S. dollar fluctuations against foreign currency have an impact to commercial prices and raw material costs in some cases and could result in local price increases if the price or raw material costs is denominated in U.S. dollar.\nSales and expenses of the Company\u2019s non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and fluctuations of foreign currency against the U.S. dollar could impact U.S. dollar-denominated earnings. In addition, the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can also be impacted by foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, which could result in exchange gain or loss from revaluation.\nDuPont also faces exchange rate risk from the Company\u2019s investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.\nDuPont has a balance sheet hedging program and actively looks for opportunities in managing currency exposures related to earnings. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to it or be successful in completely mitigating such exposures.\nDuPont generates significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While DuPont employs comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure the Company\u2019s ability to fund the Company\u2019s operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom DuPont transacts business could expose it to financial loss.\nAny one or more of the above factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s international operations and could significantly affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Changes and Compliance\nThe costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.\nDuPont continues to be subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental, health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the Company\u2019s operations, or require modifications to the Company\u2019s facilities. Changes to regulations or the implementation of additional regulations, may result in significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced margins or profitability.\nAccordingly, environmental, health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities causing a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by industry-specific risks including process safety and product stewardship/regulatory compliance issues.\nDuPont is subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, product safety or quality; shifting consumer preferences; federal, state, and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling; environmental, health and safety regulations; and customer product liability claims. While DuPont maintains general liability insurance, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. In addition, negative publicity related to product liability, food safety, safety, health and environmental matters may damage the Company\u2019s reputation. The occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn most jurisdictions, DuPont must test the safety, efficacy and environmental impact of the Company\u2019s products to satisfy regulatory requirements and obtain the needed approvals. In certain jurisdictions, DuPont must periodically renew the Company\u2019s approvals, which may require it to demonstrate compliance with then-current standards. The regulatory approvals process is lengthy, complex and in some markets unpredictable, with requirements that can vary by product, technology, industry and country. Additionally, the regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of non-governmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reactions to the actual or perceived impacts of new technology, products or processes on safety, health and the environment. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals will require submitting a significant amount of information and data, which may require participation from technology providers. Regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing. The pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance. To maintain the Company\u2019s right to produce or sell existing products or to commercialize new products, DuPont must be able to demonstrate the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy the requirements of regulatory agencies.\nThe failure to meet existing and new requirements or receive necessary permits or approvals could have near- and long-term effects on the Company\u2019s ability to produce and sell certain current and future products, which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIncreased concerns regarding chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the environment have resulted in more restrictive regulations, may lead to new regulations and compliance may be costly.\nConcerns about chemicals and biotechnology, as well as their potential impact on health and the environment, reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection. These concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals, preferred purchasing, delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals, delayed product launches, lack of market acceptance, product discontinuation, continued pressure for and adoption of more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation. These concerns could also influence public perceptions, the viability or continued sales of certain of the Company\u2019s products, the Company\u2019s reputation and the cost to comply with regulations and, as a result, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities will be dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which DuPont operates.\nThe Company\u2019s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of the Company\u2019s tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. The Company\u2019s tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), will increase tax uncertainty and impact the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes.\nGeneral Risks that may impact the Company\u2019s business\nThe Company\u2019s results will be affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, will be affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company\u2019s response to downward pricing trends to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company\u2019s incentive programs, or the customer\u2019s ability to achieve incentive goals; (iv) the impact of tariffs or trade disputes on availability of raw materials; and (v) changes in customers\u2019 preferences for the Company\u2019s products, including the success of products offered by the Company\u2019s competitors, and changes in customer\u2019s designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company\u2019s products.\nAdditionally, success in achieving the Company\u2019s growth objectives is significantly dependent on the timing and market acceptance of the Company\u2019s new product offerings, including the Company\u2019s ability to renew the Company\u2019s pipeline of new product offerings and to bring those offerings to market. This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful. The Company\u2019s success will depend on several factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences\n\u2022allocate the Company\u2019s research & development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;\n\u2022anticipate and respond to the Company\u2019s competitors\u2019 development of new products and services and technological innovations;\n\u2022differentiate the Company\u2019s offerings from the Company\u2019s competitors\u2019 offerings and avoid commoditization;\n\u2022innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in the Company\u2019s served markets;\n\u2022obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before the Company\u2019s competitors do;\n\u2022successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;\n\u2022obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope; and\n\u2022stimulate customer demand for, and convince customers, to adopt new technologies\nThere are no guarantees that new product offerings will prove to be commercially successful. Additionally, the Company\u2019s expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses.\nDuPont is subject to numerous laws, regulations and mandates globally which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results and forward strategy.\nDuPont is required to comply with the numerous and far-reaching laws and regulations administered by United States federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities. DuPont is required to comply with other general business regulations covering areas such as income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, trade sanctions, environmental protections, product safety, and handling and production of regulated substances. DuPont expects to frequently face challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges may include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.\nIn evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, DuPont expects to record reserves for estimates of potential additional tax DuPont may owe. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject it to administrative, civil and criminal remedies including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions and recalls of the Company\u2019s products, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nGovernmental policies, including antitrust and competition law, trade restrictions, regulations related to medical applications and devices, food safety regulations, sustainability requirements, traceability and other government regulations and mandates, can impact the Company\u2019s ability to execute this strategy successfully.
