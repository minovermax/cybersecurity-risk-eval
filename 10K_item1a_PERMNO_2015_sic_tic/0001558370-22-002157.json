{"cik": "1611983", "company": "Liberty Broadband Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report are not the only ones that relate to our businesses or our capitalization. The risks described below are considered to be the most material. However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFactors Relating to Our Corporate History and Structure\nWe are a holding company, and we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments.\nOur ability to meet our current and future financial obligations, including to make debt service obligations under the Margin Loan Agreement (defined below) and the Company Debentures (defined below), and other contractual commitments depends upon our ability to access cash. We are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments, available funds under the Margin Loan Agreement (defined below) (which was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2021) and proceeds from any asset sales or other forms of asset monetization we may undertake in the future. In addition, the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject.\nOther than cash generated from our participation in Charter\u2019s stock repurchase program, we do not have access to the cash that Charter generates from its operating activities.\nNotwithstanding our ownership interest in Charter and our having three nominees on its thirteen-member board of directors, we have no ability to cause Charter to pay dividends to us, and we cannot cause Charter to make funds available to us except to the extent we are obligated to participate in Charter\u2019s stock repurchase program pursuant to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement and the letter agreement entered into on February 23, 2021 in order to reduce our percentage equity interest, on a fully diluted basis, to the Equity Cap. Charter generated approximately $16,239 million, $14,562 million and $11,748 million of cash from its operations during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Charter uses the cash it generates from its operations primarily to fund its business operations, service its debt and other financial obligations and repurchase shares of its common stock. We do not have access to the cash that Charter generates unless Charter declares a dividend on its capital stock payable in cash, engages in stock repurchases for cash or otherwise distributes or makes payments to its stockholders, including us. Historically, Charter has not paid any dividends on its capital stock or, with limited exceptions, otherwise distributed cash to its stockholders and instead has used all of its available cash in the expansion of its business, to service its debt obligations and to repurchase shares of its common stock. Covenants in Charter\u2019s existing debt instruments also restrict the payment of dividends and cash distributions to stockholders. We expect that Charter will continue to apply its available cash as described above.\nWe rely on Charter to provide us with the financial information that we use in accounting for our ownership interest in Charter as well as information regarding Charter that we include in our public filings.\nWe account for our approximately 30.9% economic ownership interest in Charter using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, in our financial statements we record our share of Charter\u2019s net income or loss. Within the meaning of U.S. accounting rules, we rely on Charter to provide us with financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which we use in the application of the equity method. We also rely on Charter to provide us with the information regarding their company that we include in our public filings. In addition, we cannot change the way in which Charter reports its financial results or require Charter to change its internal controls over financial reporting. No assurance can be given that Charter will provide us with the information necessary to enable us to complete our public filings on a timely basis or at all.\nI-29\nFurthermore, any material misstatements or omissions in the information Charter provides to us or publicly files could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and filing status under federal securities laws.\nWe may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe do not believe we are currently subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d) because our investment in Charter enables us to exercise significant influence over Charter. We have substantial involvement in the management and affairs of Charter, including through our board nominees. We nominated three of Charter\u2019s thirteen current directors. In connection with the Transactions, on May 23, 2015, we entered into the Stockholders Agreement, which continues to provide us with board nomination rights. If, however, our investment in Charter was deemed to become passive (such as in the event that our equity interests were significantly diluted and our nominees ceased to serve as directors of Charter), we could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company, which could result in significant registration and compliance costs, could require changes to our corporate governance structure and financial reporting and could restrict our activities going forward. Our restated certificate of incorporation includes a provision that would enable us, at the option of our board of directors, to automatically convert each outstanding share of our Series B common stock into one share of our Series A common stock at such time as we have outstanding less than 20% of the total number of shares of our Series B common stock issued in our 2014 spin-off from Liberty. In addition, if we were to become inadvertently subject to the Investment Company Act and failed to register as an investment company in violation of the Investment Company Act, such violation could subject us to material adverse consequences, including potentially significant regulatory penalties and the possibility that our contracts would be deemed unenforceable.\nOur company has overlapping directors and officers with Liberty, Qurate Retail, TripCo and Liberty Media Acquisition Corporation, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nAs a result of our spin-off from Liberty in 2014 and other transactions between 2011 and 2014 that resulted in the separate corporate existence of Liberty, Qurate Retail, and TripCo, as well as the initial public offering of Liberty Media Acquisition Corporation (\u201cLMAC\u201d) in January 2021, all of our executive officers also serve as executive officers of Liberty, Qurate Retail, TripCo and LMAC, and there are overlapping directors. Other than Liberty\u2019s ownership of LMAC\u2019s sponsor, which beneficially owns 20% of LMAC\u2019s outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2021, none of these companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. Our executive officers and members of our company\u2019s board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Liberty, Qurate Retail, TripCo, LMAC or any other public company have fiduciary duties to that company\u2019s stockholders. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when our company, Liberty, Qurate Retail, TripCo or LMAC pursues acquisitions and other business opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Each of our company, TripCo and LMAC has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and their respective restated certificate of incorporation provides that no director or officer of the respective company will breach their fiduciary duty and therefore be liable to the respective company or its stockholders by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including Liberty, Qurate Retail, TripCo and LMAC) instead of the respective company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to our company, unless (x) such opportunity was expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the respective company or as a director or officer of any of the respective company\u2019s subsidiaries, and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of business in which the respective company or any of its subsidiaries is then directly engaged. In addition, any potential conflict that qualifies as a \u201crelated party transaction\u201d (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer\u2019s board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Any other potential conflicts that arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with Liberty, Qurate Retail, TripCo, LMAC and/or their respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, Liberty, Qurate Retail, TripCo, or LMAC or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nCertain of our inter-company agreements were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of Liberty.\nWe entered into a number of inter-company agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by Liberty for certain of our businesses. In addition, we entered into a services agreement\nI-30\nwith Liberty pursuant to which it provides to us certain management, administrative, financial, treasury, accounting, tax, legal and other services, for which we reimburse them on a fixed fee basis, which was amended to provide that components of our President and Chief Executive Officer\u2019s compensation will either be paid directly to him by our company or reimbursed to Liberty, in each case, based on the allocation set forth in the amendment. The terms of all of these agreements (other than the amendment to the services agreement) were established while we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty, and hence may not be the result of arms\u2019 length negotiations. We believe that the terms of these inter-company agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances; however, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and disallowed business interest carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), of our Company.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a deferred tax asset attributable to federal and state net operating losses and disallowed business interest carryforwards of $94 million and under the Code, we may carry forward our federal net operating losses and disallowed business interest deductions in certain circumstances to offset current and future taxable income and reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code and related Treasury regulations (generally, a cumulative change in ownership that exceeds 50% of the value of a corporation's stock over a rolling three-year period) at a time when our market capitalization is below a certain level or proposed Treasury regulations under Section 382 of the Code issued during 2019 have become final and are applicable (taking into account the delayed effective date of such regulations), our ability to use our federal net operating loss and disallowed business interest carryforwards could be substantially limited. This limit could impact the timing of the usage of our net operating loss and disallowed business interest carryforwards, thus accelerating federal cash tax payments or causing certain federal net operating loss carryforwards to expire prior to their use, which could affect the ultimate realization of that deferred tax asset. Similar limitations may also apply at the state level.\nFactors Related to Our and Our Subsidiaries\u2019 Indebtedness\nOur company may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing, or refinance or renew our existing indebtedness, on acceptable terms. Further, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to service our respective debt and any other obligations will require access to funds, which may be restricted.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $3.7 billion principal amount of debt outstanding, consisting of (i) $1.3 billion outstanding under a credit agreement (as amended, the \u201cMargin Loan Agreement\u201d) governing a multi-draw margin loan agreement credit facility entered into in 2017 by a bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary (\u201cSPV\u201d) of Liberty Broadband; (ii) $575 million outstanding under our 2.75% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2050 and $825 million outstanding under our 1.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2050 (collectively, the \u201cCompany Debentures\u201d); (iii) $15 million outstanding under the 1.75% exchangeable senior debentures due 2046 originally issued by GCI Liberty; (iv) $600 million outstanding under GCI, LLC\u2019s 4.750% senior notes due 2028 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d); and (v) $399 million in outstanding term and revolving loans under GCI, LLC\u2019s senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the \u201cSenior Credit Facility\u201d). We also had $1.0 billion remaining available to be drawn until five business days prior to May 12, 2024 at December 31, 2021 under the Margin Loan Agreement. Further, as a result of multiple transactions, including the Combination, we have entered into an indemnification agreement pursuant to which, among other things, (1) we will indemnify Liberty Interactive LLC (\u201cLiberty LLC\u201d) with respect to any of Liberty LLC's 1.75% Exchangeable Debentures due 2046 (the \u201cLiberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures\u201d) surrendered for exchange to Liberty LLC on or before October 5, 2023 for the amount by which (i) the exchange value exceeds (ii) the sum of the adjusted principal amount of such Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures plus the amount of certain tax benefits attributable to such Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures so exchanged, and (2) Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband and GCI Liberty will indemnify each other with respect to certain potential losses in respect of the 2018 split-off of GCI Liberty by Qurate Retail.\nOur and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to service the respective financial obligations will depend on our and their ability to access cash, and cash flows from operations may be insufficient to satisfy the respective financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time. Accessing cash at operating subsidiaries will depend on those subsidiaries individual operating results and any statutory or regulatory restrictions. The obligations under the Margin Loan Agreement are secured by a portion of our ownership interest in Charter. Such equity interests are held through SPV. The terms of the Margin Loan Agreement limit\nI-31\nour company\u2019s ability to secure additional financing on favorable terms. In addition, covenants included in the Senior Notes and Senior Credit Facility will limit the ability of certain subsidiaries to upstream or downstream cash for this purpose. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 other potential sources of cash include available cash balances, dividends and interest from its investments, monetization of public investments, and proceeds from asset sales.\nMoreover, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to secure additional financing will depend upon the operating performance of our subsidiaries, the value of our investment in Charter, prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, the state of competition in our subsidiaries\u2019 respective markets, the outcome of certain legislative and regulatory issues and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available, or that we will be able to renew or refinance existing indebtedness, on desirable terms or at all. If financing is not available when needed or is not available on favorable terms, we and our subsidiaries may be unable to take advantage of business or market opportunities as they arise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe and our subsidiaries have significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAs discussed above, as of December 31, 2021, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $3.7 billion principal amount of debt outstanding. As a result of this significant indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may:\n\u25cf Experience increased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf Be required to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to principal and interest payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf Be impeded in our and their ability to optimally capitalize and manage cash flows;\n\u25cf Be restricted from making strategic acquisitions or required to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u25cf Be exposed to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any variable rate portion of indebtedness; and\n\u25cf Be limited in planning for, or reacting to, changes in business or market conditions and placing us and our subsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our and our subsidiaries\u2019 leverage may prevent us and them from exploiting.\nIn addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future. For example, at December 31, 2021, we had $1.0 billion remaining available to be drawn until five business days prior to May 12, 2024 under the Margin Loan Agreement and we could issue additional exchangeable senior debentures. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. For additional limitations on our company\u2019s ability to potentially service our direct debt obligations, see \u201cWe are a holding company, and we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments\u201d and \u201cOther than cash generated from our participation in Charter\u2019s stock repurchase program, we do not have access to the cash that Charter generates from its operating activities\u201d above.\nThe agreements that govern our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current and future indebtedness may contain various affirmative and restrictive covenants that will limit our discretion in the operation of our business.\nAs discussed above, SPV entered into the Margin Loan Agreement pursuant to which SPV had outstanding borrowings of $1.3 billion, with $1.0 billion remaining available to be drawn until five business days prior to May 12, 2024, at December 31, 2021. The Margin Loan Agreement contains various covenants, including those that limit our ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness either directly, through another of our subsidiaries, or by having SPV enter into financing arrangements with respect to the stock of Charter, and cause SPV to enter into unrelated businesses or otherwise conduct business other than owning common stock of Charter and other assets as permitted under the Margin Loan Agreement documents.\nFurther, the agreements governing our and our subsidiaries\u2019 other indebtedness contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to finance future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our and their best interest.\nI-32\nWe may also enter into certain other indebtedness arrangements in the future. The instruments governing such indebtedness, often contain covenants that, among other things, place certain limitations on a borrowers\u2019 ability to incur more debt, exceed specified leverage ratios, pay dividends, make distributions, make investments, repurchase stock, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate, and transfer or sell assets. Any failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe various covenants in existing or future indebtedness may restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to expand or to pursue business strategies. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our and their control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we and our subsidiaries will be able to comply. A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures and/or the credit agreements. If there were an event of default under the Margin Loan Agreement, the indentures and/or the credit agreements, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately. Additionally, if we or our subsidiaries fail to repay the debt under any secured indebtedness when it becomes due, the lenders under such indebtedness could proceed against the assets that are pledged to them as security. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects the Company to interest rate risk, which could cause its debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under the Margin Loan Agreement and the Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, the Company's debt service obligations on any variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and net income and cash flow could decrease.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s variable rate indebtedness uses London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the rate. In 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative: (a) immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the one week and two month U.S. dollar settings; and (b) immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar settings. The United States Federal Reserve has also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate. The Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a committee convened by the Federal Reserve that includes major market participants, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from the LIBOR benchmarks is anticipated in coming years. Accordingly, the outcome of these reforms is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of borrowings under the aforementioned debt instruments. Additionally, our Margin Loan Agreement and Senior Credit Facility provide for a transition to a SOFR based rate or to other alternative reference rates depending on acceptance in the market of these rates.\nIn order to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate risk, in the future, it may enter into derivative financial instruments, typically interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments. If the Company is unable to enter into interest rate swaps, it may adversely affect its cash flow and may impact its ability to make required principal and interest payments on its indebtedness and, even if we use these instruments to selectively manage risks, there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against material interest rate fluctuations.\nI-33\nFactors Relating to COVID-19\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect the financial condition and results of operations of Charter and GCI Holdings.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and caused economic disruption. At this time, we cannot predict the duration of any business disruption and the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on the businesses of Charter and GCI Holdings. As a general matter, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and a significant global recession may result.\nWith respect to Charter, we cannot predict the depth and duration of the economic impact to Charter\u2019s residential and business customers\u2019 ability to pay for its products and services. In addition, there is uncertainty regarding the impact of government emergency declarations, the ability of Charter\u2019s suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to it, the pace of new housing construction, the pace of households moving residences, changes in business spend in Charter\u2019s local and national ad sales business, the effects to employees\u2019 health and safety, and resulting reorientation of its work activities and the risk of limitations on the deployment and maintenance of Charter\u2019s services (including by limiting customer support and on-site service repairs and installations).\nWith respect to GCI Holdings, because of the geographic concentration of GCI Holdings\u2019 operations in Alaska, growth of GCI Holdings' business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska, which we expect will continue to be impacted by COVID-19 and the measures taken in Alaska and around the world to address the pandemic. At the end of 2019, the Alaska economy showed signs of emerging from a recession that started in late 2015. However, GCI Holdings expects this recession to continue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. GCI Holdings is unable to predict the depth and duration of the economic impact to its customers\u2019 ability to pay for products and services, even after taking into account the impact of extended unemployment benefits and other stimulus packages and governmental assistance provided to its customers. Historically, recessions have had an adverse impact on its business and could adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of its products and services and cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of its products and services. GCI Holdings\u2019 customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to GCI Holdings. There is a risk that GCI Holdings\u2019 accounts receivable and bad debt expense will increase substantially due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, GCI Holdings is unable to predict the impact to its business from future government emergency declarations, the ability of its suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to GCI Holdings and the risk of limitations on the deployment and maintenance of GCI Holdings\u2019 services, changes in business spend in GCI Holdings\u2019 ad sales business, the effects to employees\u2019 health and safety, and resulting reorientation of its work activities and the risk of limitations on the deployment and maintenance of its services (including by limiting customer support and on-site service repairs and installations).\nThe Alaska economy is dependent upon the oil industry, state government spending, United States military spending, investment earnings and tourism. A decline in oil prices could put significant pressure on the Alaska state government budget. Although Alaska state government has significant reserves that GCI Holdings believes will help fund the state government for the next couple of years, major structural budgetary reforms will be required in order to offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and a decline in oil prices. Although GCI Holdings cannot predict the long-term impact COVID-19 will have on these sectors of the Alaska economy, adverse circumstances in these industries may have an adverse impact on the demand for its products and services and on its results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Charter and GCI Holdings remains fluid and the likelihood of an impact that could be material increases the longer the virus impacts activity levels in the locations in which they operate. Delays in the widespread distribution of vaccines, or lack of public acceptance, could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. In addition, new variants of the virus may continue to emerge. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy and other major global economies may experience a prolonged recession, and we anticipate Charter and GCI Holdings could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the U.S. and other major markets.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our or Charter\u2019s or GCI Holdings\u2019 respective businesses, financial conditions and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening the other risks described in these Risk Factors, such as those relating to fluctuations in our stock price and the market value of our interests in publicly-traded securities,\nI-34\nthe effect of increases in data usage on GCI Holdings\u2019 wired and wireless networks on network capacity limitations, impairments, our significant level of indebtedness and our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations.\nFactors Relating to GCI Holdings\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that it currently deems to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect the business operations of GCI Holdings, which the Company refers to as \"GCI\" in the following risk factors relating to the business of GCI Holdings. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nGCI faces competition that may reduce its market share and harm its financial performance.\nThere is substantial competition in the telecommunications and entertainment industries. Through mergers, various service integration strategies, and business alliances, major providers are striving to strengthen their competitive positions. GCI faces increased wireless services competition from national carriers in the Alaska market and increasing video services competition from DBS providers and over-the-top content providers who are often able to offer more flexible subscription packages and exclusive content.\nThe Company expects competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products, and the availability of increased federal funding of broadband infrastructure. The Company cannot predict which of many possible future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain GCI\u2019s competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services. GCI\u2019s ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on its ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors. To the extent GCI does not keep pace with technological advances or fails to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in its industry and in its markets, GCI could lose market share or experience a decline in its revenue and net income. Competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services. Competitive pressures also create challenges for its ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute its business plan. GCI also faces the risk of potential price cuts by the Company\u2019s competitors partially driven by federal funding for broadband infrastructure that could materially adversely affect its market share and gross margins.\nGCI\u2019s wholesale customers including its major roaming customers may construct facilities in locations where they currently contract with GCI to use its network to provide service on their behalf. The Company could experience a decline in revenue and net income if any of GCI\u2019s wholesale customers constructed or expanded their existing networks in places where service is currently provided by GCI\u2019s network. Some of GCI\u2019s wholesale customers have greater access to financial, technical, and other resources than GCI does. GCI expects to continue to offer competitive alternatives to such customers in order to retain significant traffic on GCI\u2019s network. The Company cannot predict whether such customers will continue to see GCI\u2019s network as a compelling alternative. GCI\u2019s inability to negotiate renewals of such contracts could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf GCI experiences customer losses, the Company\u2019s financial performance will be negatively impacted.\nGCI is in the business of selling communications and entertainment services to subscribers, and its economic success is based on its ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers. If GCI is unable to retain and attract subscribers, its and the Company\u2019s financial performance will be impaired. GCI\u2019s rates of subscriber acquisition and turnover are affected by a number of competitive factors including the size of its service areas, network performance and reliability issues, changing technologies including the transition to internet protocol television, its device and service offerings, subscribers\u2019 perceptions of its services, and customer care quality. Managing these factors and subscribers\u2019 expectations is essential in attracting and retaining subscribers. Although GCI has implemented programs to attract new subscribers and address subscriber turnover, the Company cannot assure you that these programs or GCI\u2019s strategies to address subscriber acquisition and turnover will be successful. A high rate of turnover or low or negative rate of new subscriber acquisition would reduce revenue and increase the total marketing expenditures required to attract the minimum number of subscribers required to sustain GCI\u2019s business plan which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nI-35\nGCI may be unable to obtain or maintain the roaming services it needs from other carriers to remain competitive.\nSome of GCI\u2019s competitors have national networks that enable them to offer nationwide coverage to their subscribers at a lower cost than GCI can offer. The networks GCI operates do not, by themselves, provide national coverage and GCI must pay fees to other carriers who provide roaming services to it. GCI currently relies on roaming agreements with several carriers for the majority of its roaming services.\nThe FCC requires commercial mobile radio service providers to provide roaming, upon request, for voice and SMS text messaging services on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The FCC also requires carriers to offer data roaming services. The rules do not provide or mandate any specific mechanism for determining the reasonableness of roaming rates for voice, SMS text messaging or data services and require that roaming complaints be resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on a non-exclusive list of factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of particular conduct or rates. If GCI were to lose the benefit of one or more key roaming or wholesale agreements unexpectedly, it may be unable to obtain similar replacement agreements and as a result may be unable to continue providing nationwide voice and data roaming services for its customers or may be unable to provide such services on a cost-effective basis. GCI\u2019s inability to obtain new or replacement roaming services on a cost-effective basis may limit its ability to compete effectively for wireless customers, which may increase its turnover and decrease its revenue, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGCI\u2019s business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation. Changes to or interpretations of existing statutes, rules, regulations, or the adoption of new ones, could adversely affect GCI\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nAs described above in \u201cItem 1. - Business - Regulatory Matters,\u201d GCI\u2019s business is subject to extensive federal and state governmental legislation and regulation. There can be no assurance that future changes or additions to the regulatory system under which GCI operates will benefit or have no adverse effect on GCI. Similarly, these rules and regulations are subject to interpretation by the applicable agencies, and new interpretations, which could impact GCI\u2019s operations and have an adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business, position, results of operations or liquidity. There can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by Congress, the FCC or other federal, state or local government authorities will not have a similar effect.\nWith respect to wireless services provided by GCI, the licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated by the FCC, Alaska, and, potentially other state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC grants wireless licenses and imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum. There can be no guarantee that GCI\u2019s existing licenses will be renewed. In addition, while the FCC does not currently regulate wireless service providers\u2019 rates, states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and consumer-related issues. These regulations could increase the costs of GCI\u2019s wireless operations, including with respect to the maintenance of existing licenses granted by the FCC due to failure to comply with applicable regulations. GCI is also subject to FCC rules relating to E911 capabilities, and failure to comply with these rules could subject GCI to significant fines. With respect to video services provided by GCI, GCI is subject to changes in regulation that could potentially result in rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees in the future.\nWith respect to Internet services provided by GCI, GCI would be adversely impacted by the reclassification of Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. In 2015, the FCC classified Internet service as a telecommunication service. The FCC\u2019s implementing regulations prohibited broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic, and from unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging end users\u2019 and edge providers\u2019 ability to send traffic to, from, and among each other. Although a 2018 FCC order returned to a Title I classification of Internet service and eliminated many of the requirements imposed in its initial 2015 order, the FCC may seek to re-impose net neutrality requirements or some variation thereof. In addition, Congress and state legislatures may undertake similar efforts. For example, California and Vermont have undertaken such efforts. The Company cannot predict whether the FCC or Congress will re-impose the 2015 rules or some variation thereof. The increased regulatory burden if the 2015 rules were re-imposed likely would increase GCI\u2019s costs and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing service, which could have a material adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\nI-36\nUSF receivables and contributions are subject to change due to regulatory actions taken by the FCC, including the FCC\u2019s interpretations of the USF program rules, or legislative actions that change the rules and regulations governing the USF program.\nGCI participates in various USF programs, which provide government subsidies to customers in low income areas, including schools, libraries and other facilities. This support was 32% and 29% of GCI Holdings\u2019 revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. GCI had USF net receivables of $148 million and $281 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, the USF programs require GCI, Charter and other telecommunications providers to make contributions, based on certain revenue earned, into a fund used to subsidize the provision of voice services and broadband-capable voice networks in high-cost areas, the provision of voice and broadband services to low-income consumers, and the provision of internet, voice and telecommunications services to schools, libraries and certain health care providers. The USF programs in which GCI participates are highly regulated. While the rules and regulations governing the USF programs are fairly robust, there can be no assurance that any new rules or regulations adopted will not impact GCI\u2019s USF program anticipated receivables or contributions. Further, the FCC and USAC may interpret or apply the applicable rules and regulations in ways that are unexpected to GCI or other program participants. As a result, material changes to receivables and contributions may occur, which could have an adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business and the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. As described above in \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory Matters,\u201d GCI has experienced material changes to receivables and contributions from the USF programs in recent years. For example, in October 2018, the Bureau notified GCI of its decision to reduce rural rates charged to RHC customers for the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018 by approximately 26% resulting in a reduction of total support payments of $28 million, and stated that it would apply the same cost methodology going forward. In addition, although the FCC has adjusted the RHC Program funding cap and committed to annual adjustments in future years for inflation, there is no guarantee that aggregate funding will be available to pay in full the approved funding for future years. Furthermore, the FCC has adopted changes to the manner in which support issued under the RHC Program will be calculated and approved, and GCI is currently unable to assess the substance, impact on funding or timing of these changes. Although, GCI has sought FCC review of certain FCC actions regarding the RHC Program, the outcome is uncertain.\nFailure to comply with USF program requirements may have an adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business and the Company\u2019s financial position.\nThe USF programs in which GCI participates are highly regulated, and, in many cases, require highly technical and nuanced processes and procedures in order to obtain funding and to ensure compliance with the USF programs. For example, telecommunication providers and their customers are subject to regulations that set forth procedures that must be followed by both the provider and the customer, and there are limitations on communications between these parties. If a customer or a provider is found to have not complied with any aspect of these regulations, regardless of whether such noncompliance was unintentional or accidental, the FCC may deny funding and/or require disgorgement of any amounts received under the affected contracts. The FCC may also invalidate any affected contract and impose fines or penalties. Accordingly, failure to comply with these rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business and the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. As described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accrued a loss of approximately $12 million resulting from a review of certain active and expired RHC Program contracts where it has identified potential compliance issues. Although the FCC has been made aware of the potential RHC Program compliance issues, there can be no assurance that the FCC will not impose penalties or fines that would be additive to any required disgorgement or denial of funding. Further, no assurance can be given that any novated contracts will be replicated subsequently, which may affect future revenue.\nLoss of GCI\u2019s ETC status would disqualify it for USF support.\nThe USF pays support to ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline and wireless telephone service in high cost areas. If GCI were to lose its ETC status in any of the study areas where it is currently an authorized ETC whether due to legislative or regulatory reform or its failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, GCI would be ineligible to receive high cost or low income USF support for providing service in that area, which would have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nGCI may not meet its performance plan milestones under the Alaska High Cost Order.\nAs an ETC, GCI receives support from the USF to support the provision of wireline local access and wireless service in high cost areas. In 2016, the FCC published the Alaska High Cost Order which requires GCI to submit to the FCC a performance plan with five-year and ten-year commitments. If GCI is unable to meet the final performance plan milestones approved by the\nI-37\nFCC it will be required to repay 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received over the ten-year term for the relevant number of locations that GCI failed to deploy to, plus ten percent of its total Alaska High Cost Order support received over the ten-year term. Inability to meet GCI\u2019s performance plan milestones could have an adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nGCI may lose USF high cost support if another carrier adds 4G LTE service in an area where it currently provides 4G LTE service.\nUnder the Alaska High Cost Order, the FCC adopted a process for revisiting after five years whether and to what extent there is duplicative support for 4G LTE service in rural Alaska and to take steps to eliminate such duplicative support levels in the second half of the ten-year term. As a result, if another carrier builds 4G LTE service in an area where GCI is the sole provider and the FCC decides to redistribute the support then GCI\u2019s high cost support may be reduced, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nProgramming expenses for GCI\u2019s video services are increasing, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company expects programming expenses for GCI\u2019s video services to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming and costs to retransmit local broadcast stations. As GCI\u2019s contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case GCI may be unable to provide such content as part of its video services and the Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected. If GCI adds programming to its video services or if GCI chooses to distribute existing programming to its customers through additional delivery platforms, GCI may incur increased programming expenses. If GCI is unable to raise its customers\u2019 rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe decline in GCI\u2019s voice services\u2019 results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, may accelerate.\nThe Company expects GCI\u2019s voice services\u2019 results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, will continue to decline. As competition from wireless carriers, such as GCI, increases the Company expects GCI\u2019s long-distance and local access services\u2019 subscribers and revenue will continue to decline and the rate of decline may accelerate.\nIn addition, GCI\u2019s success in the local telephone market depends on its continued ability to obtain interconnection, access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services. GCI\u2019s ability to provide service in the local telephone market depends on its negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier\u2019s existing local telephone network (in some Alaska markets at cost-based rates), to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way, to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier, and in some cases, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to certain unbundled network elements. Future negotiations or arbitration proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in GCI\u2019s cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers or via wholesale offerings. GCI\u2019s local telephone services business faces the risk of unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations.\nFailure to stay abreast of new technology could affect GCI\u2019s ability to compete in the industry.\nGCI tests and deploys various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance its competitiveness and increase the utility of its services. As GCI\u2019s operations grow in size and scope, it must continuously improve and upgrade its systems and infrastructure while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of its systems and infrastructure. The emergence of alternative platforms such as mobile or tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology. Further, current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability, and the Company expects other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. GCI may not successfully complete the rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner, and they may not be widely accepted by GCI\u2019s customers or may not be profitable, in which case GCI could not recover its investment in the technology. There can be no assurance that GCI will be able to compete with advancing technology or introduce new technologies\nI-38\nand systems as quickly as it would like or in a cost effective manner. Deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of its networks with respect to both the new and existing services. Any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect GCI\u2019s ability to retain customers and may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, GCI must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If GCI is unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, GCI could experience reduced profits.\nGCI\u2019s operations are geographically concentrated in Alaska and are impacted by the economic conditions in Alaska, and GCI may not be able to continue to increase its share of the existing market for its services.\nAs described above in \u201cThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect the financial condition and results of operations of Charter and GCI Holdings,\u201d GCI offers products and services to customers primarily throughout Alaska. Because of this geographic concentration, growth of GCI\u2019s business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska, which have been negatively impacted in recent years by a recession and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, the customer base in Alaska is limited and GCI has already achieved significant market penetration with respect to its service offerings in Anchorage and other locations in Alaska. GCI may not be able to continue to increase its share of the existing markets for its services, and no assurance can be given that the Alaskan economy will grow and increase the size of the markets GCI serves or increase the demand for the services it offers. The markets in Alaska for wireless and wireline telecommunications and video services are unique and distinct within the United States due to Alaska\u2019s large geographical size, its sparse population located in a limited number of clusters, and its distance from the rest of the United States. The expertise GCI has developed in operating its businesses in Alaska may not provide GCI with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets.\nNatural or man-made disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business.\nGCI\u2019s technical infrastructure (including its communications network infrastructure and ancillary functions supporting its network such as service activation, billing and customer care) is vulnerable to damage or interruption from technology failures, power surges or outages, natural disasters, fires, human error, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing or similar events. As a communications provider, there is an increased risk that GCI\u2019s technological infrastructure may be targeted in connection with terrorism or cyberattacks, either as a primary target, or as a means of facilitating additional attacks on other targets.\nIn addition, earthquakes, floods, fires and other unforeseen natural disasters or events could materially disrupt GCI\u2019s business operations or its provision of service in one or more markets. Specifically, the majority of GCI\u2019s facilities are located in areas with known significant seismic activity. Costs GCI incurs to restore, repair or replace its network or technical infrastructure, as well as costs associated with detecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use, may be substantial and increase GCI\u2019s cost of providing service. Many of the areas in which GCI operates have limited emergency response services and may be difficult to reach in an emergency situation. Should a natural disaster or other event occur, it could be weeks or longer before remediation efforts could be implemented, if they could be implemented at all. Further, any failure in or interruption of systems that GCI or third parties maintain to support ancillary functions, such as billing, point of sale, inventory management, customer care and financial reporting, could materially impact GCI\u2019s ability to timely and accurately record, process and report information important to the Company\u2019s business. If any of the above events were to occur, GCI could experience higher churn, reduced revenue and increased costs, any of which could harm its reputation and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s insurance may not be adequate to cover the costs associated with a natural disaster or terrorist attack.\nCyberattacks or other network disruptions could have an adverse effect on the Company and GCI\u2019s business.\nThrough the Company\u2019s operations, sales and marketing activities, it collects and stores certain non-public personal information related to its customers. The Company also gathers and retains information about employees in the normal course of business. The Company may share information about such persons with vendors, contractors and other third-parties that assist with certain aspects of its business. In addition, the Company\u2019s operations depend upon the transmission of information over the Internet. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to the Company or its vendors\u2019 computer systems by, among other\nI-39\nthings, hacking into its systems or those of third parties, through fraud or other means of deceiving the Company\u2019s employees or its vendors, burglaries, errors by the Company or its vendors\u2019 employees, misappropriation of data by employees, or other irregularities that may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to its data. The techniques used to gain such access to the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 technology systems, data or customer information, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target.\nCyberattacks against GCI\u2019s or the Company\u2019s vendors\u2019 technological infrastructure or breaches of network information technology may cause equipment failures, disruption of its or their operations, and potentially unauthorized access to confidential customer or employee data, which could subject the Company to increased costs and other liabilities as discussed further below. Cyberattacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for service disruption or unauthorized access to confidential customer or employee data, have increased in frequency, scope, and potential harm for businesses in recent years. It is possible for such cyberattacks to go undetected for an extended period of time, increasing the potential harm to GCI\u2019s or the Company\u2019s respective customers, employees, assets, and reputation.\nTo date, GCI has not been subject to cyberattacks or network disruptions that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to GCI\u2019s operations or financial condition. Although GCI has not detected a material security breach or cybersecurity incident to date, it has been the target of events of this nature and expects to be subject to similar attacks in the future. GCI engages in a variety of preventive measures at an increased cost to GCI, in order to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and safeguard its infrastructure and confidential customer information, but as with all companies, these measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all cyberattacks, system compromises or misuses of data. Such measures include, but are not limited to the following industry best practices: application whitelisting, anti-malware, message and spam filtering, encryption, advanced firewalls, threat detection, and URL filtering. Despite these preventive and detective actions, GCI\u2019s efforts may be insufficient to repel a major cyberattack or network disruption in the future and prevent the risks described above.\nSome of the most significant risks to GCI\u2019s information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure include:\n\u25cf Cyberattacks that disrupt, damage, and gain unauthorized access to GCI\u2019s network and computer systems including data breaches caused by criminal or terrorist activities;\n\u25cf Undesired human actions including intentional or accidental errors and break-ins;\n\u25cf Malware (including viruses, worms, cryptoware, and Trojan horses), software defects, unsolicited mass advertising, denial of service, ransomware, and other malicious or abusive attacks by third parties; and\n\u25cf Unauthorized access to GCI\u2019s information technology, billing, customer care, and provisioning systems and networks and those of its vendors and other providers.\nIf hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to GCI\u2019s technology systems, networks, or infrastructure, they may be able to access, steal, publish, delete, misappropriate, modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential customer or employee data. Moreover, additional harm to customers or employees could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential customer data. A network disruption (including one resulting from a cyberattack) could cause an interruption or degradation of service and diversion of management attention, as well as permit access, theft, publishing, deletion, misappropriation, or modification to or of confidential customer data. Due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks, GCI may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access.\nThe costs imposed on GCI as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant. Among others, such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures, litigation, regulatory actions, fines, sanctions, lost revenue from business interruption, and damage to the public\u2019s perception regarding GCI\u2019s ability to provide a secure service. As a result, a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and operating results. GCI also faces similar risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which it is affiliated or otherwise conduct business. While GCI maintains cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party insurance coverage, its insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all of its losses from any future disruptions or breaches of its systems or other events as described above.\nI-40\nIncreases in data usage on GCI\u2019s wired and wireless networks may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for GCI\u2019s customers.\nVideo streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional Internet activity such as web browsing and email. As use of these services continues to grow, GCI\u2019s customers will likely use more bandwidth than in the past. Additionally, new wireless handsets and devices may place a higher demand for data on GCI\u2019s wireless network. If this occurs, GCI could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions, service degradation or slower transmission speeds for its customers. Alternatively, GCI could choose to implement network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, which could negatively affect its ability to retain and attract customers in affected areas. While the Company believes demand for these services may drive customers to pay for faster speeds, competitive or regulatory constraints may preclude GCI from recovering the costs of the necessary network investments which could result in an adverse impact to its business, financial condition, and operating results.\nProlonged service interruptions or system failures could affect GCI\u2019s business.\nGCI relies heavily on its network equipment, communications providers, data and software to support all of its functions. GCI relies on its networks and the networks of others for substantially all of its revenue. GCI is able to deliver services and serve its customers only to the extent that it can protect its network systems against damage from power or communication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other disruptions. While GCI endeavors to provide for failures in the network by providing back-up systems and procedures, GCI cannot guarantee that these back-up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency. Disruption to its billing systems due to a failure of existing hardware and backup protocols could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenue and cash flow. Should GCI experience a prolonged failure, it could seriously jeopardize its ability to continue operations. In particular, should a significant service interruption occur, GCI\u2019s ongoing customers may choose a different provider, and its reputation may be damaged, reducing its attractiveness to new customers.\nIf failures occur in GCI\u2019s undersea fiber optic cable systems or GCI\u2019s TERRA facilities and its extensions, GCI\u2019s ability to immediately restore the entirety of GCI\u2019s service may be limited and the Company could incur significant costs.\nGCI\u2019s communications facilities include undersea fiber optic cable systems that carry a large portion of its traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states, one of which provides an alternative geographically diverse backup communication facility to the other. GCI\u2019s facilities also include TERRA and its extensions some of which are unringed, operating in a remote environment and are at times difficult to access for repairs. Damage to an undersea fiber optic cable system or TERRA and its extensions could result in significant unplanned expense. For example, in January 2020, a fiber break occurred in GCI\u2019s TERRA ring in Alaska\u2019s Cook Inlet. Although service was not materially affected and has since been fully restored, and the financial impact was not significant, full functionality was not restored until March 2020 due to the uniquely challenging environmental conditions in the location of the fiber break. If a failure of both sides of the ring of GCI\u2019s undersea fiber optic facilities or GCI\u2019s ringed TERRA facility and its unringed extensions occurs and GCI is not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services GCI offers to its customers could be interrupted, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nIf a failure occurs in GCI\u2019s satellite communications systems, GCI\u2019s ability to immediately restore the entirety of its service may be limited.\nGCI\u2019s communications facilities include satellite transponders that GCI uses to serve many rural and remote Alaska locations. Each of GCI\u2019s C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders are backed up using on-board transponder redundancy. In the event of a complete spacecraft failure the services are restored using capacity on other spacecraft that are held in reserve. If a failure of GCI\u2019s satellite transponders occurs and GCI is not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services GCI offers to its customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nI-41\nGCI depends on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply communications equipment. If GCI does not obtain the necessary communications equipment, GCI will not be able to meet the needs of its customers.\nGCI depends on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply wireless, Internet, video and other telephony-related equipment. If GCI\u2019s providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet GCI\u2019s needs or provide them at an acceptable cost, GCI may not be able to satisfy demand for its services and competitors may fulfill this demand. Due to the unique characteristics of the Alaska communications markets (i.e., remote locations, rural, satellite-served, low density populations, and the Company\u2019s leading edge services and products), in many situations GCI deploys and utilizes specialized, advanced technology and equipment that may not have a large market or demand. GCI\u2019s vendors may not succeed in developing sufficient market penetration to sustain continuing production and may fail. Vendor bankruptcy, or acquisition without continuing product support by the acquiring company, may require GCI to replace technology before its otherwise useful end of life due to lack of on-going vendor support and product development.\nThe suppliers and vendors on which GCI relies may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which GCI depends, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. The Company is unable to predict whether GCI\u2019s business will be affected by any such litigation. The Company expects GCI\u2019s dependence on key suppliers to continue as they develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. The failure of GCI\u2019s key suppliers to provide products or product support could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, and results of operations.\nGCI does not have insurance to cover certain risks to which it is subject, which could lead to the occurrence of uninsured liabilities.\nAs is typical in the communications industry, GCI is self-insured for damage or loss to certain of its transmission facilities, including its buried, undersea and above-ground fiber optic cable systems. If GCI becomes subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities, the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.\nGCI uses a third-party vendor for its customer billing systems. Any errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruption could have adverse operational, financial and reputational effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nGCI\u2019s third-party billing services vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact GCI and over which GCI may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of this billing services system could disrupt GCI\u2019s operations and impact its ability to provide or bill for its services, retain customers, or attract new customers, and negatively impact overall customer experience. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage.\nAny significant impairment of GCI\u2019s indefinite-lived intangible assets would lead to a reduction in its net operating performance and a decrease in its assets.\nGCI had $1.3 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2021, consisting of goodwill of $762 million, cable certificates of $550 million and other intangibles of $37 million. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition. GCI\u2019s cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business. GCI\u2019s wireless licenses are from the FCC and give it the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.\nIf GCI makes changes in its business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect its operations, it may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to a decrease in its assets and a reduction in its net operating performance. GCI\u2019s indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, GCI is required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the goodwill and/or the indefinite-lived intangible assets, as appropriate, in the period in which the determination is made. The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment requires\nI-42\nGCI to make significant estimates about its future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies. Any changes to key assumptions, or actual performance compared with those assumptions, about GCI\u2019s business and its future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value, resulting in an impairment charge.\nFactors Relating to Charter\nThe following risks relate specifically to our equity affiliate Charter. If any of these risks were realized, they could have a material adverse effect on the value of our equity interest in Charter, which could negatively impact our stock price and our financial prospects.\nCharter operates in a very competitive business environment, which affects its ability to attract and retain customers and can adversely affect its business, operations and financial results.\nThe industry in which Charter operates is highly competitive and has become more so in recent years. In some instances, Charter competes against companies with fewer regulatory burdens, access to better financing and greater and more favorable brand name recognition. Increasing consolidation in the telecommunications and content industries have provided additional benefits to certain of Charter\u2019s competitors, either through access to financing, resources, or efficiencies of scale including the ability to launch new video services.\nCharter\u2019s Internet service faces competition from the phone companies\u2019 FTTH, FTTN, fixed wireless broadband, Internet delivered via satellite and DSL services. Various operators offer wireless Internet services delivered over networks which they continue to enhance to deliver faster speeds and also continue to expand 5G mobile services. Charter\u2019s voice and mobile services compete with wireless and wireline phone providers, as well as other forms of communication, such as text, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email. Competition from these companies, including intensive marketing efforts with aggressive pricing and exclusive programming may have an adverse impact on Charter\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers.\nCharter\u2019s video service faces competition from a number of sources, including DBS services, and companies that deliver linear network programming, movies and television shows on demand and other video content over broadband Internet connections to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices, often with password sharing among multiple users and security that makes content susceptible to piracy. Newer products and services, particularly alternative methods for the distribution, sale and viewing of content will likely continue to be developed, further increasing the number of competitors that Charter faces.\nThe increasing number of choices available to audiences, including low-cost or free choices, could negatively impact not only consumer demand for Charter\u2019s products and services, but also advertisers\u2019 willingness to purchase advertising from Charter. Charter competes for the sale of advertising revenue with television networks and stations, as well as other advertising platforms, such as online media, radio and print. Competition related to Charter\u2019s service offerings to businesses continues to increase as well, as more companies deploy more fiber to more buildings, which may negatively impact Charter\u2019s growth and/or put pressure on margins.\nCharter\u2019s failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technologies and changes in customer expectations and behavior could significantly adversely affect its competitive position with respect to the leisure time and discretionary spending of its customers and, as a result, affect its business and results of operations. Competition may also reduce its expected growth of future cash flows which may contribute to future impairments of Charter\u2019s franchises and goodwill and Charter\u2019s ability to meet cash flow requirements, including debt service requirements.\nCharter depends on third party service providers, suppliers and licensors; thus, if it is unable to procure the necessary services, equipment, software or licenses on reasonable terms and on a timely basis, its ability to offer services could be impaired, and Charter\u2019s growth, operations, business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nCharter depends on a limited number of third party service providers, suppliers and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide some of its services. Some of Charter\u2019s hardware, software and operational support vendors, and service providers represent its sole source of supply or have, either through contract\nI-43\nor as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. Charter\u2019s ability to provide some services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might interrupt or delay its ability to serve its customers, if any of these parties experience or engage in the following:\n\u25cf breach or terminate or elect not to renew their agreements with Charter or otherwise fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner;\n\u25cf demand exceeds these vendors\u2019 capacity;\n\u25cf tariffs are imposed that impact vendors' ability to perform their obligations or significantly increase the amount Charter pays;\n\u25cf experience operating or financial difficulties;\n\u25cf significantly increase the amount Charter is required to pay (including demands for substantial non-monetary compensation) for necessary products or services;\n\u25cf cease production of any necessary product due to lack of demand, profitability or a change in ownership or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services Charter needs in a timely manner at its specifications and at reasonable prices.\nCharter\u2019s third-party service providers, suppliers and licensors have been disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines, restrictions on employees\u2019 ability to work, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, or other travel or health-related restrictions. Furthermore, an extended duration of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in significant disruptions in Charter\u2019s supply chain. For example, quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, travel restrictions and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, could impact the availability or productivity of personnel at third-party supply manufacturers, distributors, freight carriers and other necessary components of Charter\u2019s supply chain. In addition, the existence of only a limited number of vendors of key technologies can lead to less product innovation and higher costs. These events could materially and adversely affect Charter\u2019s ability to retain and attract customers and its operations, business, financial results and financial condition.\nProgramming costs per video customer are rising at a fast rate, and Charter may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rates of, or pass on to its customers, its increasing programming costs, which would adversely affect its cash flow and operating margins.\nVideo programming has been, and is expected to continue to be, Charter\u2019s largest operating expense item. Media corporation and broadcast station group consolidation has resulted in fewer suppliers and additional selling power on the part of programming suppliers. Charter expects programming rates per video customer will continue to increase due to a variety of factors including annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media and broadcast station groups consolidation, increased demands by owners of broadcast stations for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other services to retransmission consent, and additional programming, particularly new services. The inability to fully pass programming cost increases on to its customers has had, and is expected in the future to have, an adverse impact on Charter\u2019s cash flow and operating margins associated with the video product. Programming contracts often restrict the structure of the video packages Charter offers which impacts the affordability and competitive positioning of its video service. The contracts set to expire in any particular year vary. There can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms.\nIn addition, a number of programmers have begun to sell their services through alternative distribution channels, including IP-based platforms, which are less secure than Charter\u2019s video distribution platforms. There is growing evidence that these less secure video distribution platforms are leading to video product theft via password sharing among consumers. Password sharing may drive down the number of customers who pay for certain programming, putting programmer revenue at risk, and which in turn may cause certain programmers to seek even higher programming fees from Charter. The ability for consumers to receive the same content for free through such unauthorized channels has devalued Charter\u2019s video product which could impact sales, customer retention and Charter\u2019s ability to pass through programming costs to consumers, which increases the risk of non-renewal when programmers seek increases. To the extent that Charter is unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that it believes are reasonable, Charter has been, and may be in the future, forced to remove such programming channels from its line-up, which may result in a loss of customers. Charter\u2019s failure to carry programming that is attractive to its customers could adversely impact Charter\u2019s customer levels, operations and financial results.\nI-44\nIncreased demands by owners of some broadcast stations for carriage of other services or payments to those broadcasters for retransmission consent are likely to further increase Charter\u2019s programming costs. Federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between \u201cmust-carry\u201d rights and an alternative \u201cretransmission-consent\u201d regime. When a station opts for the retransmission-consent regime, Charter is not allowed to carry the station\u2019s signal without that station\u2019s permission. In some cases, Charter carries stations under short-term arrangements while it attempts to negotiate new long-term retransmission agreements. If negotiations with these programmers prove unsuccessful, they could require Charter to cease carrying their signals, possibly for an indefinite period. Any loss of stations could make Charter\u2019s video service less attractive to customers, which could result in less subscription and advertising revenue. In retransmission-consent negotiations, broadcasters often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other stations or programming services in which they or their affiliates have an interest. Carriage of these other services, as well as increased fees for retransmission rights, may increase Charter\u2019s programming expenses and diminish the amount of capacity it has available to introduce new services, which could have an adverse effect on its business and financial results.\nCharter\u2019s inability to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand for new products and services could adversely affect its ability to compete effectively.\nCharter operates in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. From time to time, Charter may pursue strategic initiatives to launch products or enhancements to its products. Charter\u2019s success is, to a large extent, dependent on its ability to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to address consumers\u2019 changing demands and distinguish its services from those of its competitors. Charter may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new products and services. If Charter chooses technologies or equipment that are less effective, cost-efficient or attractive to customers than those chosen by its competitors, if technologies or equipment on which Charter has chosen to rely cease to be available to it on reasonable terms or conditions, if Charter offers services that fail to appeal to consumers, are not available at competitive prices or that do not function as expected, or Charter is not able to fund the expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, or if Charter is no longer able to make its services available to its customers on a third-party device on which a substantial number of customers have relied to access its services, its competitive position could deteriorate, and its business and financial results could suffer.\nThe ability of some of Charter\u2019s competitors to introduce new technologies, products and services more quickly than Charter does may adversely affect its competitive position. Furthermore, advances in technology, decreases in the cost of existing technologies or changes in competitors\u2019 product and service offerings may require Charter in the future to make additional research and development expenditures, or to offer at no additional charge or at a lower price, certain products and services that Charter currently offers to customers separately or at a premium. In addition, the uncertainty of Charter\u2019s ability, and the costs, to obtain intellectual property rights from third parties could impact its ability to respond to technological advances in a timely and effective manner.\nCharter\u2019s inability to maintain and expand its upgraded systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner, or to anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could materially adversely affect Charter\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers. In addition, as Charter continues to grow its mobile services using virtual network operator rights from a third party, Charter expects continued growth-related sales and marketing and other customer acquisition costs as well as negative working capital impacts from the timing of device-related cash flows when Charter provides the devices pursuant to equipment installation plans. Charter also continues to consider and pursue opportunities in the mobile space which may include the acquisition of additional licensed spectrum and may include entering into or expanding joint ventures or partnerships with wireless or cable providers which may require significant investment. For example, Charter now holds CBRS PALs to support existing and future mobile services. These licenses are subject to revocation and expiration. Although Charter expects to be able to maintain and renew these licenses, the loss of one or more licenses could significantly impair its ability to offload mobile traffic and achieve cost reductions. If Charter is unable to continue to grow its mobile business and achieve the outcomes it expects from its investments in the mobile business, Charter\u2019s growth, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCharter\u2019s business may be adversely affected if Charter cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which its business depends.\nCharter relies on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses and other agreements with its employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain Charter\u2019s intellectual property rights in technology and the products and services used in its operations. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change, Charter both develops its own technologies, products and services and relies on technologies developed or licensed by third parties. However,\nI-45\nany of Charter\u2019s intellectual property rights, or the rights of its suppliers, could be challenged or invalidated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit Charter to take advantage of current industry trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm. Charter may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, claims of intellectual property infringement could require Charter to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, which could require Charter to change its business practices or offerings and limit its ability to compete effectively. Even unsuccessful claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from Charter\u2019s business. Infringement claims continue to be brought frequently in the communications and entertainment industries, and Charter is also often a party to such litigation alleging that certain of its services or technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nVarious events could disrupt or result in unauthorized access to Charter\u2019s networks, information systems or properties and could impair its operating activities and negatively impact Charter\u2019s reputation and financial results.\nNetwork and information systems technologies are critical to Charter\u2019s operating activities, both for its internal uses, such as network management and supplying services to Charter\u2019s customers, including customer service operations and programming delivery. Network or information system shutdowns or other service disruptions caused by events such as computer hacking, phishing, dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, \u201ccyber attacks\u201d such as ransomware, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity pose increasing risks. Both unsuccessful and successful \u201ccyber attacks\u201d on companies have continued to increase in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. While Charter develops and maintains systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as techniques used in such attacks become more sophisticated and change frequently. Charter, and the third parties on which Charter relies, may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. While from time to time attempts have been made to access Charter\u2019s network, these attempts have not as yet resulted in any material release of information, degradation or disruption to its network and information systems.\nCharter\u2019s network and information systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, accidents, natural disasters (including extreme weather arising from short-term or any long-term changes in weather patterns), terrorist attacks and similar events. Charter\u2019s system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and Charter\u2019s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.\nAny of these events, if directed at, or experienced by, Charter or technologies upon which Charter depends, could have adverse consequences on Charter\u2019s network, customers and business, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers, and damage to Charter\u2019s or its customers' equipment and data. Large expenditures may be necessary to repair or replace damaged property, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance that Charter maintains against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover Charter\u2019s losses or otherwise adequately compensate Charter for any disruptions to its business that may result. Any such significant service disruption could result in damage to Charter\u2019s reputation and credibility, customer dissatisfaction and ultimately a loss of customers or revenue. Any significant loss of customers or revenue, or significant increase in costs of serving those customers, could adversely affect Charter\u2019s growth, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, Charter\u2019s operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in its information technology systems and networks and those of its third-party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. Charter provides certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with its business, and there is a risk that this information may be compromised.\nCharter processes, stores and transmits large amounts of data, including the personal information of its customers. Ongoing increases in the potential for mis-use of personal information, the public\u2019s awareness of the importance of safeguarding personal information, and the volume of legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information have resulted in increases to Charter\u2019s information-related risks. Charter could be exposed to significant costs if such risks were to materialize, and such events could damage Charter\u2019s reputation, credibility and business and have a negative impact on its revenue. Charter could be subject to regulatory actions and claims made by consumers in\nI-46\nprivate litigations involving privacy issues related to consumer data collection and use practices. Charter also could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach.\nCharter\u2019s exposure to the economic conditions of its current and potential customers, vendors and third parties could adversely affect its cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nCharter is exposed to risks associated with the economic conditions of its current and potential customers, the potential financial instability of its customers and their financial ability to purchase its products. If there were a general economic downturn, Charter may experience increased cancellations or non-payment by its customers or unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased. This may include an increase in the number of homes that replace their video service with Internet-delivered and/or over-air content, as well as an increase in the number of Internet and voice customers substituting mobile data and voice products for wireline services which would negatively impact Charter\u2019s ability to attract customers, increase rates and maintain or increase revenue. In addition, Charter\u2019s ability to gain new customers is dependent to some extent on growth in occupied housing in its service areas, which is influenced by both national and local economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may also have a negative impact on Charter\u2019s advertising revenue. These events have adversely affected Charter in the past, and may adversely affect its cash flow, results of operations and financial condition if a downturn were to occur.\nIn addition, Charter is susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which Charter relies to provide products and services or to which it outsources certain functions. The same economic conditions that may affect Charter\u2019s customers, as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, also could adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices, reduction in output or the bankruptcy of Charter\u2019s vendors or third parties upon which Charter relies. Any interruption in the services provided by Charter\u2019s vendors or by third parties could adversely affect Charter\u2019s cash flow, results of operation and financial condition.\nIf Charter is unable to retain key employees, its ability to manage its business could be adversely affected.\nCharter\u2019s operational results have depended, and its future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of its management team. Charter\u2019s ability to retain and hire new key employees for management positions could be impacted adversely by the competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications and technology industries. The loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees could adversely affect Charter\u2019s ability to manage its business and its future operational and financial results.\nCharter has a significant amount of debt and expects to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could adversely affect its financial health and its ability to react to changes in its business.\nCharter has a significant amount of debt and expects to (subject to applicable restrictions in its debt instruments) incur additional debt in the future as Charter maintains its stated objective of 4.0 to 4.5 times Adjusted EBITDA leverage (net debt divided by the last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA). As of December 31, 2021, Charter\u2019s total principal amount of debt was approximately $91.2 billion with a leverage ratio of 4.4 times Adjusted EBITDA.\nCharter\u2019s significant amount of debt could have consequences, such as:\n\u25cf impact its ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rates, or at all;\n\u25cf make it vulnerable to interest rate increases, in part because approximately 13% of its borrowings as of December 31, 2021 were, and may continue to be, subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u25cf expose it to increased interest expense to the extent it refinances existing debt with higher cost debt;\n\u25cf require it to dedicate a significant portion of its cash flow from operating activities to make payments on its debt, reducing its funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate expenses;\n\u25cf limit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business, the cable and telecommunications industries, and the economy at large;\n\u25cf place it at a disadvantage compared to its competitors that have proportionately less debt; and\n\u25cf adversely affect its relationship with customers and suppliers.\nI-47\nTo the extent Charter\u2019s current debt amounts increase more than expected, Charter\u2019s business results are lower than expected, or credit rating agencies downgrade its debt limiting its access to investment grade markets, the related risks that Charter now faces will intensify.\nIn addition, Charter\u2019s variable rate indebtedness may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, stopped publishing one week and 2 month U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) LIBOR rates after 2021 with remaining USD LIBOR rates ceasing to be published on June 30, 2023 (the \u201cFCA Announcement\u201d). In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR. It is not presently known whether SOFR or any other alternative reference rates that have been proposed will attain market acceptance as replacements of LIBOR. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such phase out and selection of an alternative reference rate, together with disruption in the financial markets, could increase in the cost of Charter\u2019s variable rate indebtedness.\nThe agreements and instruments governing Charter\u2019s debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect its ability to operate its business, as well as significantly affect its liquidity.\nCharter\u2019s credit facilities and the indentures governing its debt contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect Charter\u2019s ability to operate its business, its liquidity, and its results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, Charter\u2019s and Charter\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u25cf incur additional debt;\n\u25cf repurchase or redeem equity interests and debt;\n\u25cf issue equity;\n\u25cf make certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u25cf pay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u25cf dispose of assets or merge;\n\u25cf enter into related party transactions; and\n\u25cf grant liens and pledge assets.\nAdditionally, the Charter Communications Operating, LLC (\u201cCharter Operating\u201d) credit facilities require Charter Operating to comply with a maximum total leverage covenant and a maximum first lien leverage covenant. The breach of any covenants or obligations in Charter\u2019s indentures or credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing Charter\u2019s long-term indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders under Charter\u2019s notes and the Charter Operating credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in substantially all of Charter\u2019s subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors.\nCharter\u2019s business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation, which could adversely affect its business.\nRegulation of the cable industry has increased cable operators\u2019 operational and administrative expenses and limited their revenue. Cable operators are subject to numerous laws and regulations including those covering the following:\n\u25cf the provision of high-speed Internet service, including net neutrality and transparency rules;\n\u25cf the provision of voice communications;\n\u25cf cable franchise renewals and transfers;\n\u25cf the provisioning, marketing and billing of cable and Internet equipment;\n\u25cf customer and employee privacy and data security;\nI-48\n\u25cf copyright royalties for retransmitting broadcast signals;\n\u25cf the circumstances when a cable system must carry a broadcast station and the circumstances when it first must obtain retransmission consent to carry a broadcast station;\n\u25cf limitations on Charter\u2019s ability to enter into exclusive agreements with multiple dwelling unit complexes and control Charter\u2019s inside wiring;\n\u25cf equal employment opportunity;\n\u25cf the resiliency of Charter\u2019s networks to maintain service during and after disasters and power outages;\n\u25cf emergency alert systems, disability access, pole attachments, commercial leased access and technical standards;\n\u25cf marketing practices, customer service, and consumer protection; and\n\u25cf approval for mergers and acquisitions often accompanied by the imposition of restrictions and requirements on an applicant's business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction.\nLegislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase Charter\u2019s costs or impose additional restrictions on Charter\u2019s businesses.\nChanges to existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or adoption of new ones, or participation in new regulatory programs, could have an adverse effect on Charter\u2019s business.\nThere are ongoing efforts to amend or expand the federal, state, and local regulation of some of the services offered over Charter\u2019s cable systems, particularly its retail broadband Internet access service. Potential legislative and regulatory changes could adversely impact its business by increasing costs and competition and limiting Charter\u2019s ability to offer services in a manner that that would maximize its revenue potential. These changes could include, for example, the reclassification of Internet services as regulated telecommunications services; restrictions on how Charter manages its Internet access services and networks; the adoption of new privacy restrictions on its collection, use and disclosure of certain customer information; new data security and cybersecurity mandates that could result in additional network and information security requirements for Charter\u2019s business; new restraints on Charter\u2019s discretion over programming decisions; new restrictions on the rates Charter charges to consumers for one or more of the services it offers; changes to the cable industry\u2019s compulsory copyright license to carry broadcast signals; new requirements to assure the availability of navigation devices from third-party providers; new Universal Service Fund obligations on Charter\u2019s provision of Internet service that would add to the cost of that service; increases in government-administered broadband subsidies to rural areas that could result in subsidized overbuilding of its more rural facilities; changes to the FCC's administration of spectrum; and changes in the regulatory framework for VoIP telephone service, including the scope of regulatory obligations associated with Charter\u2019s VoIP telephone service and its ability to interconnect its VoIP telephone service with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications service.\nAs a winning bidder in the FCC\u2019s RDOF auction in 2020, Charter must comply with numerous FCC and state requirements prior to and after receiving such funding. To comply with these RDOF program requirements, Charter has chosen in the RDOF areas to offer certain of its VoIP telephone services, such as its federal or state Lifeline services, subject to traditional federal and state common carrier regulations. Additionally, in the RDOF areas, Charter will offer certain of its broadband Internet access services subject to required discounts and other marketing-related terms. If Charter fails to comply with those requirements, the FCC could consider Charter in default of the RDOF program rules, and Charter could incur substantial penalties or forfeitures. For example, if Charter fails to attain certain specified infrastructure build-out requirements under the RDOF program, the FCC could withhold future support payments until those shortcomings are corrected. Charter\u2019s failure to comply with the rules and requirements for the RDOF program could result in being suspended or disbarred from future governmental programs or contracts for a significant period of time, which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nIf any laws or regulations are enacted that would expand the regulation of Charter\u2019s services, they could affect Charter\u2019s operations and require significant expenditures. Charter cannot predict future developments in these areas, and any changes to the regulatory framework for Charter\u2019s Internet, video, mobile or VoIP services could have a negative impact on its business and results of operations.\nI-49\nIt remains uncertain what rule changes, if any, will ultimately be adopted by Congress and the FCC and what operating or financial impact any such rules might have on Charter, including on its programming agreements, customer privacy and the user experience. In addition, the FCC, the FTC, and various state agencies and attorney general actively investigate industry practices and could impose substantial forfeitures for alleged regulatory violations.\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to Charter\u2019s tax and fee positions could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nCharter operates cable systems in locations throughout the United States and, as a result, is subject to the tax laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. From time to time, legislative and administrative bodies change laws and regulations that change Charter\u2019s effective tax rate or tax payments. Certain states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on Charter\u2019s services or changing the methodologies or base on which certain fees and taxes are computed. Potential changes include additional taxes or fees on Charter\u2019s services which could impact its customers, changes to income tax sourcing rules and other changes to general business taxes, central/unit-level assessment of property taxes and other matters that could increase Charter\u2019s income, franchise, sales, use and/or property tax liabilities. For example, some local franchising authorities have imposed franchise fee assessments on Charter\u2019s broadband Internet access service (in addition to Charter\u2019s video service), and more may do so in the future. If challenges to such assessments are unsuccessful, it could adversely impact Charter\u2019s costs. Although the FCC issued a decision precluding the imposition of such duplicative fees, that favorable decision is currently subject to judicial review. In addition, federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that Charter\u2019s tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that it would be successful in any such challenge.\nCharter\u2019s cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination and are non-exclusive. The failure to renew a franchise or the grant of additional franchises in one or more service areas could adversely affect its business.\nCharter\u2019s cable systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits, and similar authorizations issued by a state or local governmental authority controlling the public rights-of-way. Many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. Franchise authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. In some instances, local franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and Charter has operated and is operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities.\nThere can be no assurance that Charter will be able to comply with all significant provisions of its franchise agreements and certain of its franchisers have from time to time alleged that Charter has not complied with these agreements. Additionally, although historically Charter has renewed its franchises without incurring significant costs, there can be no assurance that Charter will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, its franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more service areas could adversely affect Charter\u2019s business in the affected geographic area.\nCharter\u2019s cable system franchises are non-exclusive. Consequently, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises to competitors in the same geographic area or operate their own cable systems. In some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with Charter on more favorable terms.\nFactors Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nWe expect our stock price to continue to be directly affected by the results of operations of Charter and developments in its business.\nThe fair value of our investment in Charter, on an as-converted basis, was approximately $34.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, which represents a meaningful portion of our total market value. As a result, our stock price will continue to be directly affected by the results of operations of Charter and the developments in its business.\nI-50\nAlthough our Series B common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets, there is no meaningful trading market for the stock.\nOur Series B common stock is not widely held, with approximately 93% of the outstanding shares beneficially owned by John C. Malone, the Chairman of the Board and a director of our company as of January 31, 2022. Although it is quoted on the OTC Markets, it is sparsely traded and does not have an active trading market. The OTC Markets tend to be highly illiquid, in part, because there is no national quotation system by which potential investors can track the market price of shares except through information received or generated by a limited number of broker-dealers that make markets in particular stocks. There is also a greater chance of market volatility for securities that trade on the OTC Markets as opposed to a national exchange or quotation system. This volatility is due to a variety of factors, including a lack of readily available price quotations, lower trading volume, absence of consistent administrative supervision of \"bid\" and \"ask\" quotations, and market conditions. Each share of the Series B common stock is convertible, at any time at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock, which is listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"LBRDA.\"\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf authorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;\n\u25cf authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf classifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u25cf limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u25cf prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u25cf establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation; and\n\u25cf the existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, John C. Malone currently beneficially owns shares representing the power to direct approximately 49% of the aggregate voting power in our company, due to his beneficial ownership of approximately 93% of the outstanding shares of our Series B common stock as of January 31, 2022.\nHolders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock.\nPrinciples of Delaware law and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required\nI-51\nto make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14988, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "LBRDK"}
