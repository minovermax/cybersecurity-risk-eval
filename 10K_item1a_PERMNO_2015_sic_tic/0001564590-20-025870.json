{"cik": "1009672", "company": "CARBO CERAMICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the trends, risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following trends, risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected, the trading prices of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Chapter 11 Proceedings\nOn March 29, 2020, the Company and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions commencing the Chapter 11 Cases under the Bankruptcy Code. The Chapter 11 Cases and the Restructuring may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the Chapter 11 Cases and the Restructuring are likely to have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock and ultimately are expected to result in the cancellation of our common stock.\nIn the fall of 2019, we engaged an investment bank and financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other things, exploring strategic alternatives, forecasting cash flow, analyzing and preserving liquidity, and implementing contingency planning for a potential\nin-court process were the Company unsuccessful in consummating a strategic alternative out of court solution. These restructuring efforts led to the execution of the RSA and commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court on March 29, 2020.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and the key personnel necessary to our business. In addition, during the period of time we are involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, our clients and suppliers might lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and may discontinue conducting business with us or seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nOther significant risks include or relate to the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s approval with respect to motions or other requests made to the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Cases, including maintaining strategic control as debtor-in-possession;\n\u2022\ndelays in the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nour ability to consummate the Plan;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nthe effects of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases on our business and the interest of various constituents, including our shareholders, customers, suppliers, service providers, and employees;\n\u2022\nthe high costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related advisory costs to effect our reorganization;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, service providers, employees and other third parties as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to fund and execute our business plan;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain acceptable and appropriate financing;\n\u2022\nBankruptcy Court rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases as well as the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases in general;\n\u2022\nthe length of time that we will operate with Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the proceedings;\n\u2022\nour ability to confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 Cases, views and objections of creditors and other parties in interest that may make it difficult to consummate a plan in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a plan of reorganization, to appoint a U.S. trustee or to convert the Chapter 11 Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (\u201cChapter 7\u201d);\n\u2022\nthird-party motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with our ability to consummate the Plan; and\n\u2022\nthe potential adverse effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on our liquidity and results of operations.\nBecause of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our corporate or capital structure, although we expect such proceedings to result in the cancellation of our common stock.\nDelays in the Chapter 11 Cases may increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and may increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nThe RSA contemplates the consummation of the Plan through an orderly pre-negotiated plan of reorganization, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate the Plan. A prolonged Chapter 11 proceeding could adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers, service providers, and employees, among other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our\nbusiness, competitive position, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern. A weakening of our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could adversely affect our ability to implement the Plan (or any other plan of reorganization). If we are unable to consummate the Plan, we may be forced to liquidate our assets.\nIn addition, the occurrence of the effective date of the Plan is subject to certain conditions and requirements that may not be satisfied or waived.\nThe Plan may not become effective.\nThe Plan may not become effective because it is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or waived and, therefore, that the Plan will become effective and that we will emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases as contemplated by the Plan. If the effective date of the Plan is delayed, we may not have sufficient cash available to operate our business. In that case, we may need new or additional post-petition financing, which may increase the cost of consummating the Plan. There is no assurance of the terms on which such financing may be available or if such financing will be available. If the transactions contemplated by the Plan are not completed, it may become necessary to amend the Plan. The terms of any such amendment are uncertain and could result in material additional expense and result in material delays to the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe may not be able to obtain Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the Plan or may have to modify the terms of the Plan.\nEven if the Plan is approved by each class of holders of claims and interests entitled to vote (a \u201cVoting Class\u201d), the Bankruptcy Court, which, as a court of equity, may exercise substantial discretion and may choose not to confirm the Plan. Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code requires, among other things, a showing that confirmation of the Plan will not be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization for us, and that the value of distributions to dissenting holders of claims and interests will not be less than the value such holders would receive if we, the debtors, liquidated under Chapter 7. Although we believe that the Plan will satisfy such tests, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion.\nConfirmation of the Plan will also be subject to certain conditions. These conditions may not be met and there can be no assurance that the Supporting Lenders will agree to modify or waive such conditions. Further, changed circumstances may necessitate changes to the Plan. Any such modifications could result in less favorable treatment than the treatment currently anticipated to be included in the Plan based upon the agreed terms of the RSA. Such less favorable treatment could include a distribution of property (including the new common stock that would be issued to the Supporting Lenders upon our emergence from bankruptcy) to the class affected by the modification of a lesser value than currently anticipated to be included in the Plan or no distribution of property whatsoever under the Plan. Changes to the Plan may also delay the confirmation of the Plan and our emergence from bankruptcy, which could result in, among other things, incurred costs and expenses to the estates of the debtors.\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we may not be able to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern.\nEven if the Plan, or any other plan of reorganization, is consummated, we may continue to face a number of risks, such as further deterioration or other changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry, changes in demand for our services and increasing expenses. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the Plan, or any other plan of reorganization, will achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, even if our debts are reduced through a plan of reorganization, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of the Chapter 11 Cases. Our access to additional financing may be limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms.\nThe Plan or another plan of reorganization that we may implement will be based upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, we may not be able to successfully execute such plan.\nThe Plan or any other plan of reorganization that we may implement will affect both our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our business and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) our ability to substantially change our capital structure; (ii) our ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iii) our ability to maintain customers\u2019 confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them; (iv) our ability to retain key employees, and (v) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions and conditions of the our industry. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of our business.\nIn addition, the Plan or any other plan of reorganization, will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is possible that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. In our case, the forecasts are even more speculative than normal, because they involve fundamental changes in the nature of our capital structure. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations may differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us or our business or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of our plan of reorganization.\nOur cash flows may not provide sufficient liquidity during the Chapter 11 Cases. Our long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nOur ability to fund our operations and our capital expenditures requires a significant amount of cash. Our current principal sources of liquidity include the available borrowing capacity under the DIP Facility and cash flow generated from operations. If our cash flow from operations decreases, we may not have the ability to expend the capital necessary to maintain our current operations, negatively impacting our future revenues.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have limited, if any, access to additional financing. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for the Chapter 11 proceedings and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11 proceedings. As a result, we may not be able to comply with the covenants of the DIP Facility, and our cash on hand and cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 Cases until we are able to emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of the DIP Facility agreements, (ii) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any cash collateral order that may be entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, (iii) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iv) our ability to generate cash flow from operations, (v) our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan or another alternative restructuring transaction and (vi) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe may be unable to comply with restrictions or with budget, liquidity, or other covenants imposed by the agreements governing the DIP Facility. Such non-compliance could result in an event of default under the terms of the DIP Facility that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe DIP Facility requires that we comply with general affirmative and negative covenants such as prohibiting us from incurring or permitting debt, investments, liens or dispositions unless specifically permitted. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control and our failure to comply, or obtain a waiver in the event we cannot comply with a covenant, could result in an event of default under the DIP Facility and permit the lenders thereunder to accelerate the loans and otherwise exercise remedies allowable by the agreements governing the DIP Facility.\nCompeting plans of reorganization, which could have less favorable terms or result in significant litigation and expenses.\nParties in interest may seek to file alternative plans of reorganization. An alternative plan of reorganization could contemplate us continuing as a going concern, us being broken up, us or our assets being acquired by a third party, us being merged with a competitor, or some other proposal. There can be no assurances that recoveries under any such alternative plan would be as favorable to creditors as the Plan. In addition, the proposal of competing plans of reorganization may entail significant litigation and significantly increase the expenses of administration of the Chapter 11 Cases, which could deplete creditor recoveries under any plan.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future performance, which may be volatile.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as restructuring activities and expenses significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases. In addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to our historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to the Plan. We expect that we will be required to adopt the fresh start accounting rules, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting may be different from historical trends.\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. The Plan will result in the cancellation of our common stock.\nUnder the Plan, all existing equity interests in the Company will be extinguished. Amounts invested by the holders of our common stock will not be recoverable and such securities will have no value. Trading prices for our common stock bear no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders thereof in the Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, we urge extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in our existing common stock.\nIf the RSA is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe RSA contains a number of termination events, upon the occurrence of which certain parties to the RSA may terminate the agreement. If the RSA is terminated as to all parties thereto, each of the parties thereto will be released from its obligations in accordance with the terms of the RSA. Such termination may result in the loss of support for the Plan by the parties to the RSA, which could adversely affect our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan. If the Plan is not consummated, there can be no assurance that the Chapter 11 Cases would not be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation cases or that any new Plan would be as favorable to holders of claims against the Debtors as contemplated by the RSA.\nIn certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert the Chapter 11 Cases to a case under Chapter 7. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in the Plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to consummation of a plan of reorganization. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to March 29, 2020 or before consummation of the Plan (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the Plan and/or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the Plan. Any claims not ultimately discharged pursuant to the Plan could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases limit the flexibility of our management team in running our business.\nWhile we operate our business as debtor-in-possession under supervision by the Bankruptcy Court, we are required to obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and, in some cases, the Supporting Lenders, prior to engaging in activities or transactions outside the ordinary course of business. Bankruptcy Court approval of non-ordinary course activities entails preparation and filing of appropriate motions with the Bankruptcy Court, negotiation with the creditors\u2019 committee (if any) and other parties-in-interest and one or more hearings. The creditors\u2019 committees and other parties-in interest may be heard at any Bankruptcy Court hearing and may raise objections with respect to these motions.\nThis process may delay such-non ordinary course transactions and limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to adapt to changing market or industry conditions or to take advantage of certain opportunities. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court does not approve a proposed activity or transaction, we would be prevented from engaging in activities and transactions that we believe to be beneficial to us.\nThe commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases has consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management and will impact how our business is conducted, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe requirements of the Chapter 11 Cases have consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of our management\u2019s time and attention and leave them with less time to devote to the operation of our business. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience employee attrition, and our employees may face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOn the effective date of the Plan, the composition of our board of directors will change substantially.\nUnder the Plan, the composition of our board of directors will change substantially. Pursuant to the Plan, our new board of directors will be appointed by the Supporting Lenders under the RSA in consultation with our management, and the numbers of directors will also be determined by the Supporting Lenders. Accordingly, almost all of our board members will be new to the Company. Any new directors are likely to have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the board of directors and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine our future. As a result, our future strategy and plans may differ materially from those of the past.\nAdverse publicity in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases or otherwise could negatively affect our businesses.\nAdverse publicity or news coverage relating to us, including, but not limited to, publicity or news coverage in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, may negatively impact our efforts to establish and promote name recognition and a positive image after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Capital Resources and Organization\nOur business and financial performance largely depends on the level of activity in the natural gas and oil industries.\nOur operations are materially dependent upon the levels of activity in natural gas and oil exploration, development and production. More specifically, the demand for our products is related to the number of natural gas and oil wells completed in geologic formations where ceramic or sand proppants are used in fracture treatments. These activity levels are affected by both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices. In recent years, oil and natural gas prices and, therefore, the level of exploration, development and production activity, have experienced significant fluctuations. Worldwide economic, political and military events, including war, terrorist activity, events in the Middle East and initiatives by OPEC, have contributed, and are likely to continue to contribute, to price volatility. Despite recent initiatives to curb supply, the global supply of oil is currently at historically high levels, and there is potential for geopolitical and regulatory events, such as normalization of trade relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran, to further increase the supply of oil. Additionally, warmer than normal winters in North America and other weather patterns may adversely impact the short-term demand for natural gas and, therefore, demand for our products and services. Natural gas prices experienced a significant decline during 2012 and, although they have increased since then, remain relatively low on a historic basis, resulting in generally lower gas drilling activity. Further, the price of oil declined precipitously from the second half of 2014 through mid-2016 and, although the price rebounded from its low in the first half of 2018, it decreased again in the second half and moreover, in the first quarter of 2020, oil prices fell approximately 20% in a single day. In March 2020, the price of oil fell even further due to a dispute over production levels between Russia and Saudi Arabia, as a result of which Saudi Arabia increased its production to record levels. While an agreement as to production cuts was reached, the global crude oil market remains significantly oversupplied, and oil prices could remain at current levels, or decline further, for an extended period of time. These events, combined with the continued outbreak of COVID-19 resulting in significant storage constraints due to lack of demand, contributed to a sharp drop in prices for oil in 2020 to-date. This reduction in oil and natural gas prices has depressed the level of natural gas and oil exploration, development, production and well completions activity, resulting in significantly reduced demand and pricing for our base ceramic and sand products. In addition and because of the depressed commodity prices, we have seen a significant increase in the use of very low quality in-basin sand at the expense of lower production for unconventional wells, which have extremely low quality reservoirs. This decline has had, and continues to have, a significant adverse impact on our results. If oil and natural gas prices and well completion activity do not materially improve and/or demand for our products does not otherwise increase, this decline could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations, including, but not limited to, the temporary idling of all, or a portion of all, of our facilities utilized for this sector of our business until such time as market conditions improve.\nRecent declines in crude oil prices to record low levels as a result of the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) and a significantly oversupplied crude oil market have negatively impacted, and are expected to continue to negatively impact, demand for our products and services resulting in a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China and has since spread to other parts of the world. The outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States and globally, together with government and private sector responsive actions, have, and are expected to continue to, adversely affect both the price of and demand for crude oil, the demand for certain of our products and services and the continuity of our and our customers\u2019 business operations.\nIt is currently impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as the situation is rapidly evolving. In March 2020, the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency, invoking powers under the Stafford Act, the legislation that directs federal emergency disaster response. A significant majority of states as well as local jurisdictions have imposed, and others in the future may impose, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. Such orders or restrictions, and the perception that such orders or restrictions could occur, have resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions and cancellation of events, among other effects.\nWhile the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and various local orders have identified the energy industry as critical to the U.S. infrastructure, generally allowing certain of our and our customers\u2019 operations to continue, our operations, and those of our customers, have been and will likely continue to be disrupted in various ways. For example, in an effort to minimize the spread of illness, we and our customers have implemented various worksite restrictions in order to minimize contact among personnel, and have also required employees to quarantine who have become ill or experienced COVID-19-related symptoms. Travel restrictions and flight cancellations have also slowed personnel travel and equipment delivery to certain customer locations. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak poses a risk of disruptions to our supply chain if a supplier were to experience production or delivery constraints due to the effects of COVID-19. Disruptions of this type and others could continue and increase for the foreseeable future. For example, cases of COVID-19 in the workplace environments of our customers have occurred, and a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 in such an environment could result in a cessation of operations which would further depress demand for our products and services. Finally, although our non-idled manufacturing and service facilities generally remain open and operational as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, governmental mandates or the illness or absence of a substantial number of employees could require that we temporarily close one or more of such facilities, or may prohibit or significantly restrict us, our customers and third-party providers upon whom we and they rely from remaining operational.\nIn addition, we have implemented work-from-home policies for certain employees. The effects of shelter-in-place orders and our work-from-home policies may negatively impact productivity and disrupt our business, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course.\nContemporaneously with the widespread outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, Saudi Arabia announced a material increase in crude oil production in response to a dispute with Russia over crude oil production levels, resulting in global oil markets being significantly oversupplied, particularly in light of the reduced demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil declined precipitously beginning in the middle of March, reaching a low price of beneath $0.00 per barrel on April 20, 2020. In response, a number of our exploration and production company customers announced significant reductions in capital spending for drilling and other projects on which our products and services would be used. These reductions in spending and activity levels have negatively impacted, and we expect they will continue to negatively impact, demand for our products and services, the prices we can charge for those products and services and, as a result, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. While an agreement as to production cuts was reached, the global crude oil market remains significantly oversupplied, and whether the agreed production cuts will be sufficient to realign supply and demand in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on crude oil prices.\nThe effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets. For companies like ours in the energy industry, this disruption has been exacerbated by the global crude oil supply and demand imbalance and resulting decline in crude oil prices, and has significantly impacted the value of our common stock and which may reduce our ability to access capital in the bank and capital markets, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or long-term market correction, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could in the future further materially impact the value of our common stock, impact our access to capital and affect our business in the near and long-term.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 and depressed crude oil prices impacts our results, financial position and liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWe may not have sufficient cash and/or be able to access liquidity alternatives in the credit and capital markets to meet our liquidity needs.\nPrior to filing the Chapter 11 Cases, our primary sources of liquidity were cash on hand and cash flow from operations. Our ability to fund our working capital and capital expenditures and other obligations depends on our future operating performance and cash from operations and other liquidity-generating transactions, which are in turn subject to prevailing oil and natural gas prices, economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf our future operating performance falls materially below our expectations, our plans prove to be materially inaccurate, or industry conditions do not materially improve, we may require additional financing. Even if additional or alternative financing becomes available to us, future financing transactions may significantly increase the Company\u2019s interest expense, which could in turn reduce our financial flexibility and our ability to fund other activities, and could make us more vulnerable to changes in operating performance or economic downturns generally. The inability to generate sufficient cash, modify any of our existing or future debt arrangements, or obtain replacement or additional financing, or an event of default under our existing or future debt arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Further, for the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, we will be subject to various additional risks, including the inability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for operations, to fund the plan of reorganization and to meet future obligations, including increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and our reorganization. Further, if the transactions contemplated by the Plan are not completed such that the effective date of the Plan occurs prior to the maturity of the DIP Facility, we may need to refinance the DIP Facility. We may not be able to obtain any such financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe therefore cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to access the capital or credit markets on acceptable terms or timing, or at all. Access to the capital markets and the cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by factors beyond our control, including turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in securities trading markets, the continuing downturn in the oil and gas industry and general economic conditions. Currently, we do not qualify as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d which otherwise would allow us to, among other things, file automatically effective shelf registration statements. Now, even if we are able to access the public capital markets, any attempt to do so could be more expensive or subject us to significant delays when compared with previous periods.\nOur business and financial performance has suffered and could suffer further if the levels of hydraulic fracturing continue to decline or cease as a result of the low commodity price of oil and natural gas, development of new processes, increased regulation or a continued decrease in drilling activity.\nA large portion of our products are proppants used in the completion and re-completion of natural gas and oil wells through the process of hydraulic fracturing. Completion activity is directly impacted by the price of oil and natural gas. In addition, demand for our proppants is substantially higher in the case of horizontally drilled wells, which allow for multiple hydraulic fractures within the same well bore but are more expensive to develop than vertically drilled wells. A reduction in horizontal drilling or the development of new processes for the completion of natural gas and oil wells leading to a reduction in, or discontinuation of the use of, hydraulic fracturing could cause a decline in demand for our products. Additionally, increased regulation or environmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing or the materials used in this process could negatively affect our business by increasing the costs of compliance or resulting in operational delays, which could cause operators to abandon the process due to commercial impracticability. Moreover, future federal, state, local or foreign laws or regulations could otherwise limit or ban hydraulic fracturing. Several states in which our customers operate have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that have imposed, or could impose, more stringent permitting, transparency, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Some states, such as New York, have banned the process of hydraulic fracturing altogether. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As stated elsewhere, the upstream oil and natural gas industry is in the midst of a severe contraction, resulting in a significant reduction in horizontal drilling and further resulting in a material decline in demand for our products and services. Oil and natural gas prices have recently experienced record declines and are currently at record low levels in response to dramatic supply and demand uncertainty. In response, several exploration and production companies have recently announced plans to reduce their capital budgets and activity levels. We expect these changes will adversely affect the revenue, profitability, and cash flow from and, ultimately the financial position of, our business. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could cause a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could hurt our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face distribution and logistical challenges in our business.\nAs oil and natural gas prices fluctuate, our customers may shift their focus back and forth between different resource plays, some of which can be located in geographic areas that do not have well-developed transportation and distribution infrastructure systems. Transportation and logistical operating expenses continue to comprise a significant portion of our total delivered cost of sales. Therefore, serving our clients in these less-developed areas presents distribution and other operational challenges that affect our sales and negatively impact our operating costs. Disruptions in transportation services, including shortages of rail cars or a lack of rail transportation services or developed infrastructure, could affect our ability to timely and cost effectively deliver products to our customers and could provide a competitive advantage to competitors located in closer proximity to customers. Additionally, increases in the price of diesel fuel could negatively impact operating costs if we are unable to pass those increased costs along to our customers. Failure to find long-term solutions to these logistical challenges could adversely affect our ability to respond quickly to the needs of our customers or result in additional increased costs, and thus could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in an increasingly competitive market.\nThe proppant market is highly competitive. We compete with other domestic and international suppliers of ceramic proppant, as well as with suppliers of sand for use as proppant, in the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas and oil wells. The expiration of key patents owned by the Company has resulted in additional competition in the market for ceramic proppant. The entry of additional competitors into the market, and/or a surge in the level of ceramic proppant imports into North America from existing competitors, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur industrial products have competitors across several industries we sell into. Competition for products in the North American foundry market includes several ceramic media manufacturers. There are also a number of competitors in the grinding market that primarily manufacture their ceramic grinding products in China. We believe our industrial products are competitively priced, are of higher quality and our customer experience is better than the competition.\nOur environmental products have a large number of competitors across the United States. There are few barriers to entry in this market, however we do own key patents for some of our environmental products. We believe there are several key factors that drive customers to purchase our environmental products over the competition including centralized manufacturing, on time delivery, competitive pricing, a focus on customer satisfaction, and excellent technical support.\nAdverse changes to these key factors or a shift in customer preferences to our competitor's products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have been and may continue to be adversely affected by decreased demand for our proppant or the development by our competitors of alternative proppants.\nCeramic proppant is a premium product capable of withstanding higher pressure and providing more highly conductive fractures than mined sand, which is the most commonly used proppant type. We continue to see operators that have traditionally used ceramic proppant shifting to use mined sand instead. Despite recently improving commodity prices in the oil and natural gas industry, continued pressure on operators to reduce cost or to evaluate returns on a shorter horizon has had a detrimental impact on the demand for ceramic proppant, which is a higher cost product than mined sand. Although we believe that the use of quality ceramic proppant in appropriate geologic formations typically generates higher production rates and more favorable long-term production economics than mined sand, the shifting of customer demand to lower cost products, such as mined sand, has had an adverse effect on our results of operations and its continuation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The development and use of alternative proppant could also cause a decline in demand for our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends on achieving our strategic objectives, including the diversification of our product and service portfolio.\nAs we continue to expand our portfolio of product and service offerings to industrial and other new markets, we face certain risks associated with these new business strategies, including unknown regulatory changes and product acceptance by these new markets, that could affect our future financial results. In addition, lower than expected sales in these new markets could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations and financial condition.\nWe have no plans to pay cash dividends on our new common stock for the foreseeable future and the DIP Facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends; therefore, you will not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than you paid.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our new common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the DIP Facility generally prohibits us from paying such dividends. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation of our business and meet our debt obligations. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nThe outstanding indebtedness under our Amended Credit Agreement and the DIP Facility is, and any Exit Facility or other future debt arrangements would most likely be, secured by substantially all of our assets and guaranteed by our two domestic operating subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. We may be unable to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, whether at maturity or as a result of acceleration.\nThe outstanding indebtedness under our Amended Credit Agreement is, subject to limited exceptions, secured by a first-priority lien on a substantial amount of our assets, including (i) a pledge of all accounts receivable and inventory, (ii) cash in certain accounts, (iii) domestic distribution assets residing on owned real property, (iv) our Marshfield, Wisconsin and Toomsboro, Georgia plant facilities and equipment, and (v) certain real property interests in mines and minerals, and the outstanding indebtedness under the DIP Facility is secured by all of our assets, subject to limited exceptions. We are in default under the Amended Credit Agreement as a result of filing the Chapter 11 Cases, but the Supporting Lenders are not able to pursue remedies thereunder as a result of the automatic stay under the Bankruptcy Code. In the event of a default under the DIP Facility, the DIP Lenders may, subject to the order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the DIP Facility, (1) elect to declare all outstanding borrowings made under the DIP Facility and the guaranties of the two operating subsidiaries, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable; (2) exercise their set-off rights; and/or (3) enforce and foreclose on their security interest and liquidate some or all of such pledged assets. Any of these actions would, individually or in the aggregate, have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to repay our debt as it comes due, or to refinance our debt on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations contained in the DIP Facility or any Exit Facility or other post-emergence debt arrangement when payment obligations are no longer automatically stayed under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Failure to repay or to timely refinance any portion of our debt could result in a default under the terms of all our debt instruments and the acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding.\nWe rely upon, and receive a significant percentage of our revenues from, a limited number of key customers and end users.\nDuring 2019, our key customers included several of the largest participants in the worldwide petroleum pressure pumping industry, as well as certain operators of natural gas and oil wells. One of these customers accounted for more than 10% of our 2019 revenues. The end users of our products are numerous operators of natural gas and oil wells that hire pressure pumping service companies to hydraulically fracture wells. During 2019, a majority of our ceramic proppant sales were directed to a concentrated number of end users. We generally supply our domestic pumping service customers with products on a just-in-time basis, with transactions governed by individual purchase orders and/or a master supply agreement. Because of their purchasing power, our key customers may have greater bargaining leverage than us with respect to the negotiation of prices and other terms of the sale in their supply contracts with us, which in turn, could adversely affect our profit margins associated with those contracts. Disparities in bargaining leverage, when combined with the Company\u2019s desire to maintain long-term relationships with key customers, could limit our practical ability to assert certain terms of our supply agreements with them. Continuing sales of our products depend on our direct customers and the end user well operators being satisfied with product quality, pricing, availability, and delivery performance. While we believe we have satisfactory relations with our customers and our end users, a material decline in the level of sales to any one of our major customers or loss of a key end user due to unsatisfactory product performance, pricing, delivery delays or any other reason could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe operations of our customers, and thus the results of our operations, are subject to a number of operational risks, interruptions and seasonal trends.\nAs hydraulic fracturing jobs have increased in size and intensity, common issues such as weather, equipment delays or changes in the location and types of oil and natural gas plays can result in increased variability in proppant sales volumes. Our business operations and those of our customers involve a high degree of operational risk. Natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, collisions and operator error could cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, equipment and the environment, and suspension of operations. Our customers perform work that is subject to unexpected or arbitrary interruption or termination. The occurrence of any of these events could result in work stoppage, loss of revenue, casualty loss, increased costs and\nsignificant liability to third parties. With the increase in resource plays in the northern and eastern United States, as well as our operations in Marshfield, Wisconsin, our results of operations are increasingly exposed to seasonal variations and inclement weather. Operations in certain regions involve more seasonal risk in the winter months, and work is hindered during other inclement weather events. This variability makes it more difficult to predict sales and can result in greater fluctuations to our quarterly financial results. These quarterly fluctuations could result in operating results that are below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, and therefore may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nThe ability of our customers to complete work, as well as our ability to mine sand from cold climate areas, could be affected during the winter months. Our revenue and profitability could decrease during these periods, as well as in other severe weather conditions, because work is either prevented or more costly to complete. If a substantial amount of production is interrupted, our cash flow and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur entire oilfield and industrial production are expected to be manufactured at our McIntyre, Georgia and New Iberia, Louisiana plants. Any adverse developments at these plants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to produce all of our oilfield ceramic and industrial ceramic media production from our McIntyre, Georgia and New Iberia, Louisiana plants. Any adverse developments at these plants, including a material disruption in production, an inability to supply the plant with raw materials at a competitive cost, or adverse developments due to catastrophic events, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide environmental warranties on certain of our containment and spill prevention products.\nAGPI\u2019s tank liners, secondary containments and related products and services are designed to contain or avoid spills of hydrocarbons and other materials. If a release of these materials occurs, it could be harmful to the environment. Although we attempt to negotiate appropriate limitations of liability in the applicable terms of sale, some customers have required expanded warranties, indemnifications or other terms that could hold AGPI responsible in the event of a spill or release under particular circumstances. If AGPI is held responsible for a spill or release of materials from one of its customer\u2019s facilities, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely upon intellectual property to protect our proprietary rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may affect our competitive position, and protecting our rights or defending against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.\nThe Company uses a significant amount of trade secrets, or \u201cknow-how,\u201d and other proprietary information and technology in the conduct of its business. In some cases, we rely on trade secrets, trademarks or contractual restrictions to protect intellectual property rights that are not patented. The steps we take to protect the non-patented intellectual property may not be sufficient to protect it and any loss or diminishment of such intellectual property rights could negatively impact our competitive advantage. Additionally, our competitors could independently develop the same or similar technologies that are only protected by trade secret and thus do not prevent third parties from competing with us. Furthermore, even protected intellectual property rights can be infringed upon by third parties. Monitoring unauthorized use of Company intellectual property can be difficult and expensive, and adequate remedies may not be available.\nAlthough the Company does not believe that it is infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others by using such proprietary information and technology, it is possible that such a claim might be asserted against the Company in the future. In the event any third party makes a claim against us for infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of a third party, such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation. In addition, the Company could experience loss or cancellation of customer orders, experience product shipment delays, or be subject to significant liabilities to third parties. If our products or services were found to infringe on a third party\u2019s proprietary rights, the Company could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to continue selling its products or services. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, which could seriously harm our business. Involvement in any patent dispute or other intellectual property dispute or action to protect trade secrets and expertise could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nSignificant increases in fuel prices for any extended periods of time will increase our operating expenses.\nThe price and supply of natural gas are unpredictable, and can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other events outside of our control, such as changes in supply and demand due to weather conditions, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Natural gas is a significant component of our direct manufacturing costs and price escalations will likely increase our operating expenses and can\nhave a negative impact on income from operations and cash flows. We operate in a competitive marketplace and may not be able to pass through all of the increased costs that could result from an increase in the cost of natural gas.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations.\nWe are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management. The technical requirements of complying with these environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly expensive and complex, and may affect the Company\u2019s ability to expand its operations. Our ability to continue the expansion of our manufacturing capacity to meet market demand is contingent upon obtaining required environmental permits and compliance with their terms, which continue to be more restrictive and require longer lead times to obtain in anticipation of any efforts to expand and increase capacity. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations.\nIn addition, we use some hazardous substances and generate certain industrial wastes in our operations. Many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. These laws also may provide for \u201cstrict liability\u201d for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances.\nStricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could restrict our expansion efforts, require us to incur costs, or become the basis of new or increased liabilities. Any of these events could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.\nOur international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations.\nInternational revenues accounted for approximately 27% and 19% of our total revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively. We may not succeed in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets. Risks inherent in doing business on an international level include, among others, the following:\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability (including as a result of the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks);\n\u2022\npotential declines or increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices that would adversely affect our customers, the energy industry or our production costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements, economic sanctions, tariffs, customs, duties and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and costs;\n\u2022\npower supply shortages and shutdowns;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other labor problems;\n\u2022\ncurrency rate fluctuations, convertibility and repatriation;\n\u2022\ntaxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel;\n\u2022\npotential expropriation of assets by foreign governments and\n\u2022\nother risks relating to the administration of or changes in, or new interpretations of, the laws, regulations and policies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.\nUndetected defects in our fracture simulation software could adversely affect our business.\nDespite extensive testing, our software could contain defects, bugs or performance problems. If any of these problems are not detected, the Company could be required to incur extensive development costs or costs related to product recalls or replacements. The existence of any defects, errors or failures in our software products may subject us to liability for damages, delay the development or release of new products and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our software products or related services, any one of which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur shares of common stock are not listed for trading on a national securities exchange and thus the market for our common stock is limited, sporadic, and volatile which may impact the value of our shares and your ability to sell your shares.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace under the trading symbol \u201cCRRTQ\u201d and is not traded or listed on a national securities exchange. Investments in securities quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace are generally less liquid than investments in securities trading on a national securities exchange. We can provide no assurance that our common stock will continue to be quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of our common stock on the OTC Pink marketplace, or whether the trading volume of our common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market.\nThis may result in limited shareholder interest, including that of institutional investors, and it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares, without depressing the market price for shares of our common stock, or at all, which could further depress the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the trading of our common stock on the OTC Pink marketplace could have other negative implications, including the potential loss of confidence in us by suppliers, customers and employees.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our new common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our new common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine; however, our issuance of preferred stock is subject to the limitations imposed on us by our debt arrangements. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our new common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our new common stock.\nOur actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in forward-looking statements we make.\nSome of the statements included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements relating to trends in the natural gas and oil industries, the demand for ceramic proppant and our performance in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Business\" sections of this Form 10-K. In addition, we have made and may continue to make forward-looking statements in other filings with the SEC, and in written material, press releases and oral statements issued by us or on our behalf. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company or its officers. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, and our financial forecasts are particularly sensitive to changes in the current market conditions. Further, our financial forecasts have been less accurate during the recent downturn. See \"Business-Forward-Looking Information.\"", "PERMNO": 83366, "SIC": 3290, "TIC": "CRRTQ"}
