{"cik": "850429", "company": "TREDEGAR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The following risk factors should be considered, in addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, when evaluating Tredegar and its businesses.\nRisks Related to Aluminum Extrusions\n\u2022Sales volume and profitability of Aluminum Extrusions is cyclical and seasonal and highly dependent on economic conditions of end-use markets in the U.S., particularly in the construction sector. Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 end-use markets can be cyclical and subject to seasonal swings in volume, and have been adversely impacted during the coronavirus pandemic (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d). Because of the capital intensive nature and level of fixed costs inherent in the aluminum extrusions business, the percentage drop in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) from ongiong operations in a cyclical downturn will likely exceed the percentage drop in volume. In addition, during an economic slowdown, excess industry capacity often drives increased pricing pressure in many end-use markets as competitors seek to protect their position with key customers. Any benefits associated with cost reductions and productivity improvements may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects on profitability from pricing and margin pressure and higher bad debts (including a greater chance of loss associated with customers defaulting on fixed-price forward sales contracts) that usually accompany a downturn. In addition, higher energy costs can reduce profits unless offset by price increases or cost reductions and productivity improvements.\n\u2022Failure to prevent competitors from evading anti-dumping and countervailing duties, or a reduction in such duties, could adversely impact Aluminum Extrusions. Effective April 25, 2017, the anti-dumping duty and countervailing duty orders on aluminum extrusions were extended for a period of five years. The orders will be reviewed again beginning in\nMarch 2022. Chinese and other overseas manufacturers continue to try to evade the anti-dumping and countervailing orders to avoid duties. A failure by, or the inability of, U.S. trade officials to curtail the evasion of these duties, or the potential reduction of applicable duties pursuant to annual administrative reviews of the orders by the Department of Commerce, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions.\n\u2022The duty-free importation of goods allowed under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d) could result in lower demand for aluminum extrusions made in the U.S., which could materially and negatively affect Bonnell Aluminum\u2019s business and results of operations. In March 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs of 10% on aluminum ingot and semi-finished aluminum imported in the U.S. from certain countries, including countries from which Bonnell Aluminum has historically sourced aluminum products. In September 2019, the U.S., Canada and Mexico entered into the USMCA. As a result of the 10% tariffs on aluminum ingot imported to the U.S. and the duty-free importation of goods allowed under USMCA, aluminum extrusions made in Canada and Mexico are free of the 10% tariff and can now be imported into and sold in the U.S. at very competitive prices. This could result in lower demand for aluminum extrusions made in the U.S., which could materially and negatively affect Bonnell Aluminum\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022Competition from China could increase significantly if China is granted market economy status by the World Trade Organization. China launched a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization (\u201cWTO\u201d) challenging its non-market economy status, claiming that as of December 11, 2016, China\u2019s transition period as a non-market economy under its Accession Protocol to the WTO ended. China believes with respect to all Chinese-made products that it should receive market economy status and the rights attendant to that status under WTO rules. The U.S. and the European Union have each rejected that interpretation. If China is granted market economy status by the WTO, the extent to which the U.S. anti-dumping laws will be able to limit unfair trade practices from China will likely be limited because the U.S. government will be forced to utilize Chinese prices and costs that do not reflect market principles in anti-dumping duty investigations involving China, which could ultimately limit the level of anti-dumping duties applied to unfairly traded Chinese imports. The volume of unfairly traded imports of Chinese aluminum extrusions could increase as a result and this, in turn, would likely create substantial pricing pressure on Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 products and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions. In June 2019, at China\u2019s request, after certain preliminary rulings in the case went against the Chinese position, the WTO indefinitely suspended the proceedings on the Chinese WTO complaint.\n\u2022The markets for Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 products are highly competitive with product quality, service, delivery performance and price being the principal competitive factors. Aluminum Extrusions has approximately 1,450 customers that are in a variety of end-use markets within the broad categories of building and construction, distribution, automotive and other transportation, machinery and equipment, electrical and consumer durables. No single Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 customer exceeds 4% of consolidated net sales. Future success and prospects depend on Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 ability to provide superior service, high quality products, timely delivery and competitive pricing to retain existing customers and participate in overall industry cross-cycle growth. Failure in any of these areas could lead to a loss of customers, which could have an adverse material effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions.\nRisks Related to PE Films\n\u2022PE Films is highly dependent on sales associated with relatively few large customers. PE Films\u2019 top four customers comprised approximately 16%, 14% and 13% of Tredegar\u2019s consolidated net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The loss or significant reduction of sales associated with one or more of these customers without replacement by new business could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nAdditionally, PE Films anticipates that a portion of its film products used in surface protection applications could be made obsolete by possible future customer product transitions to less costly alternative processes or materials. These transitions principally relate to one customer. The Company believes that previously reported delays in this customer's transitions were recently resolved by the customer and much of the remaining transitions could occur by the end of 2021. Under this scenario, the Company estimates that the contribution to EBITDA from ongoing operations for PE Films could decline due to the remaining customer product transitions by $18 million in 2021 versus 2020 and $4 million in 2022 versus 2021. To offset the expected adverse impact, the Company is aggressively pursuing and making progress in generating contribution from sales from new surface protection products, applications and customers and implementing cost savings measures. Annual contribution to EBITDA from ongoing operations for PE Films on surface protection products unrelated to the customer product transitions has increased since 2018 by approximately $12 million.\nWhile PE Films is undertaking efforts to expand its customer base, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful, or that they will offset any loss of sales and profits associated with customer transitions and other large customer declines.\n\u2022Failure of PE Films\u2019 customers, who are subject to cyclical downturns, to achieve success or maintain market share could adversely impact PE Films\u2019 sales and operating margins. PE Films\u2019 plastic films are used in the production of various consumer products sold worldwide. A customer\u2019s ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market those products is integral to PE Films\u2019 success. Cyclical downturns and changing consumer preferences may negatively affect businesses that use PE Films\u2019 plastic film products, which could adversely affect sales and operating margins. Other factors that could adversely affect the business include (i) failure by a key customer to achieve success or maintain share in markets in which they sell products containing PE Films\u2019 materials, including as a result of customer preferences for products other than plastics, (ii) key customers using products developed by others that replace PE Films\u2019 business with such customers, (iii) delays in a key customer rolling out products utilizing new technologies developed by PE Films, and (iv) operational decisions by a key customer that result in component substitution, inventory reductions and similar changes.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s inability to protect its intellectual property rights or its infringement of the intellectual property rights of others could have a material adverse impact on PE Films. The continued success of the PE Films\u2019 business depends on its ability not only to protect its own technologies and trade secrets, but also to develop and sell new products that do not infringe upon existing patents. Intellectual property litigation is very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversions of Company resources, both of which could adversely affect its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of the Company\u2019s intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors.\n\u2022Disruptions to PE Films\u2019 supply chain could have a material adverse impact on PE Films. Certain raw materials used in manufacturing PE Films\u2019 products are sourced from single suppliers, and PE Films may not be able to quickly or inexpensively re-source from other suppliers. The risk of damage or disruption to its supply chain may increase if and when different suppliers consolidate their product portfolios, experience financial distress or disruption of manufacturing operations (such as, for example, the impact of hurricanes on petrochemical production). Failure to take adequate steps to effectively manage such events, which are intensified when a product is procured from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect PE Films\u2019 consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and also require additional resources to restore its supply chain.\n\u2022Rising trade tensions could cause an increase in the cost of PE Films\u2019 products or otherwise negatively impact the Company. A portion of PE Film\u2019s business involves imports to and from the U.S. and other countries where the Company produces and sells its products. Trade tensions have been rising between the U.S. and other countries, particularly China. An increase in tariffs and other trade barriers between the U.S. and China, or between the U.S. and other countries, could cause an increase in the cost of PE Films\u2019 products or otherwise negatively impact the production and sale of the Company\u2019s products in world markets.\nRisks Related to Flexible Packaging Films\n\u2022Overcapacity in Latin American polyester film production and a history of uncertain economic conditions in Brazil could adversely impact the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Flexible Packaging Films. For flexible packaging films produced in Brazil, selling prices and key raw material costs are principally determined in U.S. Dollars and are impacted by local economic conditions and local and global competitive dynamics. Flexible Packaging Films is exposed to foreign exchange translation risk (its functional currency is the Brazilian Real) because almost 90% of the sales of Flexible Packaging Films business unit in Brazil (\u201cTerphane Ltda.\u201d) and substantially all of its related raw material costs are quoted or priced in U.S. Dollars while its variable conversion, fixed conversion and sales, general and administrative costs before depreciation & amortization (collectively \u201cTerphane Ltda. Operating Costs\u201d) are quoted or priced in Brazilian Real. This mismatch, together with a variety of economic variables impacting currency exchange rates, causes volatility that could negatively or positively impact EBITDA from ongoing operations for Flexible Packaging Films. While Flexible Packaging Films hedges this exposure on a short-term basis with foreign exchange forward rate contracts, the exposure continues to exist beyond the hedging periods.\n\u2022Governmental failure to extend anti-dumping duties in Brazil on imported products or prevent competitors from circumventing such duties could adversely impact Flexible Packaging Films. In recent years, excess global capacity in the industry has led to increased competitive pressures from imports into Brazil. The Company believes that these conditions have shifted the competitive environment from a regional to a global landscape and have driven price convergence and lower product margins for Flexible Packaging Films. Favorable anti-dumping rulings or countervailing duties are in effect for products imported from China, Egypt, India, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Peru and Bahrain. Competitors not currently subject to anti-dumping duties may choose to utilize their excess capacity by selling product in Brazil, which may result in pricing pressures that Flexible Packaging Films may not be able to offset with cost savings measures and/or manufacturing efficiency initiatives. Brazilian authorities initiated an investigation for sunset review on anti-dumping rulings against China, India and Egypt and extended duties that would have expired in 2020 for\none year. There can be no assurance that efforts to extend anti-dumping duties beyond 2021 on products imported from China, India, Egypt and other countries will be successful.\nRisks Related to all Tredegar Businesses\n\u2022The Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. The Company\u2019s failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures increases the risk of a material misstatement in its consolidated financial statements, and its failure to meet its reporting and financial obligations, could, in turn, have a negative impact on its financial condition. Maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is an integral part of producing reliable financial statements. As discussed in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K (\u201cItem 9A\u201d), the Company\u2019s management concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the periods referred to therein as a result of certain deficiencies that were determined to constitute material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nUnder standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Under the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, a material weakness in the design of monitoring controls indicates that the Company has not sufficiently developed and/or documented internal controls by which management can review and oversee the Company\u2019s financial information to detect and correct material errors or that the personnel responsible for performing the review did not have the sufficient skill set or knowledge of the subject matter to perform a proper assessment.\nAs discussed in Item 9A to remediate the material weaknesses, the Company, with the assistance of its outside consultant, is in the process of implementing certain changes to its internal controls and reviewing the entire control environment to help ensure that there are no other material weaknesses. The Company believes that its remediation plan will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weaknesses and strengthen its internal control over financial reporting. The Company\u2019s remediation efforts are ongoing, and it will continue its initiatives to implement and document policies and procedures. Remediation of the identified material weaknesses and strengthening the Company\u2019s internal control environment have extended into 2021. In addition, the Company is monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on its remediation plan. Depending on the severity and length of the pandemic, the remediation timeline could be negatively impacted because of inefficiencies caused by COVID-related limitations on travel, meetings, on-site work and close collaboration and the related increase in time necessary to complete remediation projects.\nAs the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, management may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or modify the remediation plan. The Company cannot provide assurance, however, as to when it will remediate all such weaknesses, nor can it be certain of whether additional actions will be required or the costs of any such actions. Moreover, the Company cannot provide assurance that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future.\nWhile the material weaknesses discussed in Item 9A did not result in material misstatements of the Company\u2019s financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017 or in the intervening interim periods during those respective years, any failure to remediate the material weaknesses, or the development of new material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and cause it to fail to meet its reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a negative impact on its financial condition.\n\u2022Tredegar has an underfunded defined benefit (pension) plan. Tredegar sponsors a pension plan that covers certain hourly and salaried employees in the U.S. The plan was closed to new participants in 2007, and substantially frozen to benefit accruals for active participants in 2014. As of January 31, 2018, the plan no longer accrued benefits associated with crediting employees for service, thereby freezing all future benefits under the plan. As of December 31, 2020, the plan was underfunded under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) measures by $103.1 million. Tredegar expects that it will be required to make a cash contribution of approximately $11.7 million to its underfunded pension plan in 2021, and may be required to make higher cash contributions in future periods depending on the level of interest rates and investment returns on plan assets.\n\u2022Noncompliance with any of the covenants in the Company\u2019s $375 million revolving credit facility, as amended on December 1, 2020, which matures in June 2024, could result in all debt under the agreement outstanding at such time becoming due and limiting the Company\u2019s borrowing capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition and liquidity. The credit agreement governing Tredegar\u2019s revolving credit facility contains restrictions and financial covenants that, if violated, could restrict the Company\u2019s operational and financial\nflexibility. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, would result in all outstanding debt under the credit facility at such time becoming due, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition and liquidity.\n\u2022Tredegar\u2019s performance is influenced by costs incurred by its operating companies, including, for example, the cost of raw materials and energy. These costs include the cost of aluminum (the raw material on which Aluminum Extrusions primarily depends), resin (the raw material on which PE Films primarily depends), PTA and MEG (the raw materials on which Flexible Packaging Films primarily depends), natural gas (the principal fuel necessary for Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 plants to operate), electricity and diesel fuel. Aluminum, resin and natural gas prices are volatile as shown in the charts in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures in Item 7. The Company attempts to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases and contractual pass-through provisions, but there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to customers or that Tredegar will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw material and energy costs through price increases or pass-through arrangements. Further, the Company\u2019s cost control efforts may not be sufficient to offset any increases in raw material, energy or other costs.\n\u2022Tredegar is subject to current and future governmental regulation, including environmental laws and regulations, and could become exposed to material liabilities and costs associated with such regulation. The Company is subject to regulation by local, state, federal and foreign governmental authorities. New laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws, including those relating to environmental matters (including global climate change and plastic products), and privacy matters, could subject Tredegar to significant additional capital expenditures, operating expenses or other compliance costs. Moreover, future developments in federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, including environmental laws, are difficult to predict. Environmental laws and privacy restrictions have become and are expected to continue to become increasingly strict. As a result, Tredegar expects to be subject to new environmental and privacy laws and regulations. However, any such changes are uncertain and, therefore, it is not possible for the Company to predict with certainty the amount of additional capital expenditures or operating expenses that could be necessary for compliance with respect to any such changes. See Government Regulation in Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of this risk factor.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Brazilian anti-corruption laws and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees, contractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could adversely affect our business and/or our reputation.\n\u2022Material disruptions at one of the Company\u2019s major manufacturing facilities could negatively impact financial results. Tredegar believes it has implemented measures to minimize the risks of disruption at its facilities. However, a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events: an equipment failure with repairs requiring long lead times, labor stoppages or shortages, cybersecurity attacks, utility disruptions, constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials, and severe weather conditions. A material disruption in one of the Company\u2019s operating locations could negatively impact production and the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022An inability to renegotiate the Company\u2019s collective bargaining agreements could adversely impact its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Approximately 34% of the Company\u2019s employees are represented by labor unions located in the U.S. and Brazil under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. Tredegar may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements when they expire, which could result in strikes or work stoppages or higher labor costs. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at the Company\u2019s facilities in the future. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could negatively impact Tredegar\u2019s ability to manufacture its products and adversely affect its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. None of Tredegar\u2019s collective bargaining agreements expire before the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\u2022Our business and operations, and the operations of our customers, suppliers and others we do business with, may be adversely affected by epidemics such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may face risks related to health epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases. The outbreak of such a communicable disease could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies and financial markets of many countries. For example, COVID-19 has spread across the globe to every country in which the Company does business and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health epidemic, including COVID-19, poses the risk that we or our contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners may be prevented or otherwise adversely affected in the conduct of business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities and by other government mandates or policy changes. We may also face staffing issues if our employees\nbecome ill from an epidemic, are subject to epidemic-related \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, or absenteeism increases because of fear of epidemic-related health risks. An epidemic may also cause a significant reduction in demand for one or more of our products as a result of a drop in product-specific demand, because of an epidemic\u2019s impact on the world economy generally, or for other reasons. Bonnell Aluminum is experiencing higher than normal absenteeism and hiring difficulties due to COVID-19 factors. As a result, it is having difficulty maintaining sufficient labor to meet desired shipping levels. As a result of an epidemic, we may be unable to meet our supply commitments or otherwise fulfill our customers\u2019 needs due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements, including as a result of constrained workforce capacity, interruption of raw material supplies, transportation disruptions or a loss or disruption of other key elements of our manufacturing and distribution capability. An epidemic may cause the failure of, or default in performance by, third parties we rely on to supply our manufacturing operations, to process, transport or purchase our products, to finance our operations, and to otherwise provide products and services to the Company in support of our business and operations. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that any particular epidemic, including COVID-19, could have on the Company\u2019s business, the extent of that impact would likely be affected by factors outside of our control such as the severity, duration and spread of such an epidemic, the measures taken by the governments of countries affected and the ability of our customers and consumers to access government programs providing liquidity and support during the crisis. The impact of an epidemic on our employees, our customers, our supply chains, demand for our products, our ability to supply customers, our operating costs and our other business activities, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For more information on the effect of COVID-19 on our business and financial condition, refer to \u201cThe Impact of COVID-19\u201d in Item 7.\n\u2022Tredegar\u2019s valuation of its $7.5 million cost-basis investment in kal\u00e9o is volatile and uncertain. Tredegar uses the fair value method to account for its fully-diluted ownership interest of approximately 20% in kaleo, Inc. (\u201ckal\u00e9o\u201d), a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company. There is no active secondary market for buying or selling stock in kal\u00e9o. The Company\u2019s fair value estimates can fluctuate materially between reporting periods primarily due to changes in kal\u00e9o\u2019s projections, which rely on numerous assumptions, and changes in the valuation of guideline public companies as measured by their enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiples. The estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s investment in kal\u00e9o may significantly decline due to pricing pressures and expected changes in market access as well as continued lower market demand for epinephrine delivery devices resulting from COVID-19-driven delays in in-person back-to-school schedules and social distancing guidelines. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation of kal\u00e9o\u2019s Evzio business in 2018, the impact of which on kal\u00e9o and on the value of the Company\u2019s interest in kal\u00e9o cannot be estimated with certainty. During 2020, kal\u00e9o discontinued the marketing of its Evzio product.\n\u2022A failure in the Company\u2019s information technology systems as a result of cybersecurity attacks or other causes could negatively affect Tredegar\u2019s business. The Company depends on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) to record and process customers\u2019 orders, manufacture and ship products in a timely manner, secure its production processes and know-how, maintain the financial accuracy of its business records and maintain personally identified information of its employees. An IT system failure due to computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, cybersecurity attacks or other malicious causes could disrupt our operations and prevent us from being able to process transactions with our customers, operate our manufacturing facilities and properly report transactions in a timely manner. Increased global IT security threats and cyber-crime pose a potential risk to the security and availability of the Company\u2019s IT systems, networks and services, including those that are managed, hosted, provided or used by third parties, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company\u2019s data. To date, interruptions of the Company\u2019s IT systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations. A significant protracted failure of or security breach of the IT systems, networks or service providers the Company relies upon, or a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information, or personally identified information, as a result of a cybersecurity incident or other cause, could result in substantial costs to the Company, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, regulatory enforcement actions and lawsuits and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 75649, "SIC": 3081, "TIC": "TG"}
