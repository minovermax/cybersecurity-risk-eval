{"cik": "1601545", "company": "Blue Hills Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business strategy includes the continuation of significant growth plans. If we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur strategic plan includes continued asset and deposit growth and increasing the scale of our operations. Specifically, we intend to: increase our residential, commercial business and commercial real estate loans using the lending origination and servicing platform we have built; add origination capacity in our market area and adjacent market areas; expand our branch network through select de novo and acquisition opportunities; and increase fee income, including through the opportunistic acquisition of fee income businesses that complement our current product capabilities while improving the revenue contribution of fee income from existing customers and income from mortgage banking. In addition, we may expand through acquisitions, should appropriate opportunities arise.\nThe success of our strategic plan will require, among other things, that we continue to leverage our operating costs through increased loan and deposit market share within our current markets and through expansion into new markets, continue to increase our core funding and decrease our reliance on acquisition based pricing, and increase our fee income through increased deposit services, cash management services and mortgage banking. Our ability to continue to grow successfully will depend on several other factors that may not be within our control, including continued favorable market conditions in the communities we serve, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market area, and our ability to maintain high asset quality as we increase our portfolio of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans.\nWhile we believe we have the management resources, operating platform and internal systems in place to successfully manage our growth, growth opportunities and lower cost deposit sources may not be available and we may not be successful in implementing our business strategy. Furthermore, we are a regulated entity and our regulators periodically review and oversee the pace and quality of our growth in assets, liabilities and liquidity. Regulatory authorities may encourage or require faster growing banks to slow the pace of growth and expansion if regulatory concerns develop.\nBecause we intend to continue to emphasize our commercial real estate and commercial business loan originations, our overall credit risk will increase.\nWe intend to continue to grow our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolio. At December 31, 2017, $1.2 billion or 53.5% of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans (including commercial construction loans) and commercial business loans, compared to $9.2 million, or 3.4% of our total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2011, the time when we commenced our diversification strategy towards commercial lending. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally have more risk than the 1-4 family residential real estate loans that we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate and commercial business loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers.\nFurther, if we foreclose on a commercial real estate or construction loan, our holding period for the collateral may be longer than for 1-4 family residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our commercial real estate loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios.\nDownturns in the local real estate market or economy could adversely affect our earnings.\nA downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of nonperforming loans. If the Company is required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, its earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity could be adversely affected. The declines in real estate prices in the Company\u2019s markets also may result in increases in delinquencies and losses in its loan portfolios. Unexpected decreases in real estate prices coupled with a prolonged economic recovery and elevated levels of unemployment could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses. In that event, the Company\u2019s earnings could be adversely affected.\nReduced residential mortgage activity in our market would slow our growth and negatively impact our net income.\nWe have experienced residential mortgage loan growth during recent years and we have increased our residential mortgage loan infrastructure, including hiring lending officers, underwriting and support personnel and opening loan production offices. Our residential mortgage operations provide a material portion of our income and are significantly affected by market interest rates. Additionally, our mortgage lending activity is affected by home purchase and refinance activity. A reduction in mortgage refinance activity and a rising or higher interest rate environment may result in a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations, resulting in slower growth of our residential lending activity and, possibly, a decrease in the size of our residential loan portfolio. Income from secondary market mortgage operations is volatile, and we may incur losses with respect to our secondary mortgage market operations that could negatively affect our earnings. This could result in a decrease in interest income and a decrease in revenues from loan sales. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of noninterest expenses associated with our expanded residential lending platform, such as salaries and commissions, employee benefits, occupancy, equipment, data processing and other operating costs. During periods of reduced residential mortgage loan demand, our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in mortgage loan origination activity.\nIncome from secondary mortgage operations is volatile, and we may incur losses with respect to our secondary mortgage market operations.\nA key component of our strategy is to increase the extent to which we sell in the secondary market the longer term, conforming fixed-rate 1-4 family residential mortgage loans that we originate, earning non-interest income in the form of gains on sale. Although to date we have generally originated loans for sale on a \u201cbest efforts\u201d basis, and we intend to continue selling most loans in the secondary market with limited or no recourse, we are required, and will continue to be required, to give customary representations and warranties to the buyers relating to compliance with applicable law. If we breach those representations and warranties, the buyers will be able to require us to repurchase the loans and we may incur a loss on the repurchase.\nIn the future, we expect to continue to utilize \u201cbest efforts\u201d forward loan sale commitments and begin utilizing mandatory delivery forward loan sale commitments and To Be Announced (\u201cTBA\u201d) Securities, which are sold from approved counterparties to mitigate the risk of potential changes in the values of derivative loan commitments. For TBAs, we intend to sell a security in the open market with a promise to deliver a pool of loans with an aggregate specified principal amount and quality to the investor at a specified point in the future. If we fail to deliver the pool of loans, we will repurchase the security at the market price on the date of repurchase, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nFair value changes in mortgage banking derivatives and commitments to sell fixed-rate 1-4 family residential mortgages subsequent to inception are estimated using anticipated market prices based on pricing indications provided from syndicate banks and consideration of pull-through and fallout rates derived from our internal data and adjusted using management judgment. Fluctuations in interest rates may impact estimated pull-through rates on mortgage originations, which in turn may affect the valuation of forward loan sale commitments, and could negatively affect our earnings.\nChanges in the programs offered by secondary market purchasers or our ability to qualify for their programs may reduce our mortgage banking revenues, which would negatively impact our non-interest income.\nWe generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of single-family mortgage loans pursuant to programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and non-GSE investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Any future changes in these programs, our eligibility to participate in such programs, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could, in turn, materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company's wholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support operations and future growth.\nThe Company must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of its liquidity management, the Company uses a number of funding sources in addition to deposit growth and cash flows from loans and investments. These sources include Federal Home Loan Bank advances, brokered deposits, proceeds from the sale of loans, and liquidity resources at the holding company. The Company uses brokered deposits both to support ongoing growth and to provide enhanced deposit insurance to support large dollar commercial relationships. The Company's financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the Company is unable to maintain access to wholesale funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable costs. Finally, if the Company is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs. In this case, operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. Turbulence in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with the Company.\nOur branch network expansion strategy may negatively affect our financial performance.\nOn January 18, 2014, we completed the acquisition of three branches in Nantucket. We also opened de novo branch offices in Milton, Massachusetts in 2014, in University Station in Westwood, Massachusetts in 2015, and in the Boston Seaport District in October 2016. The costs to open the Westwood, Milton and Boston Seaport District de novo branches was $2.2 million, $1.4 million and $1.9 million, respectively, including the costs of construction, equipment, furnishings and technology as well as marketing and promotional expenses associated with the grand opening of the branches. Any future branch expansion strategy may not generate earnings within a reasonable period of time. Numerous factors contribute to the performance of a new or acquired branch, such as a suitable location, qualified personnel, and an effective marketing strategy. Additionally, it takes time for a new branch to generate sufficient favorably priced deposits to produce enough income, including funding loan growth generated by our organization, to offset expenses related to the branch, some of which, like salaries and occupancy expense, are considered fixed costs. At this time we have no immediate plans to open any additional de novo branches although we may continue to expand through acquisition or opening de novo branches in the future.\nChanging interest rates may have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nOur earnings and cash flows are dependent on our net interest income and income from our mortgage banking operations. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If interest rates increase rapidly, we may have to increase the rates we pay on our deposits, particularly our higher-cost money market and time deposits, and the cost of our borrowed funds may increase, more quickly than any changes in interest rates will take effect on our loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest spreads and net interest income. Furthermore, our mortgage banking income varies directly with movements in interest rates, and increases in interest rates could negatively affect our ability to originate loans in the same volumes, and sell loans with attractive pricing, as we have in recent years. Increases in interest rates may also make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.\nConversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest margin could also be negatively affected if competitive pressures keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease more rapidly through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments. Decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowings costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities.\nChanges in interest rates may also decrease fee income generated from our commercial lending operations. We enter into interest rate swap agreements with some of our commercial borrowers (and mirror swap agreements with a third party) that allow the borrower to pay a fixed interest rate on loans that are originated and carried in our loan portfolio as adjustable rate loans. We receive fee income from borrowers for providing this service. Under certain interest rate scenarios, borrowers may choose not to use this service, and our related fee income will decrease. U.S. GAAP also dictates that the Company must mark these contracts to fair value over the life of each swap. As interest rates change, positive and negative credit valuation marks on these contracts are also recorded in the income statement.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nA worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the financial crisis, there were dramatic declines in the housing market, where falling real estate values and increasing foreclosures, unemployment, and under-employment negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. Our lending business is tied, in large part, to the housing market and real estate markets in general. A return to these conditions or a general decline in economic conditions could result in more limited demand for the construction of new housing, and weakness in home pricing, and could ultimately result in increased delinquencies on our residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans. These conditions may also cause a further reduction in loan demand, and increases in our non-performing assets, net charge-offs and provisions for loan losses, as well as adversely affect our liquidity and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us. Negative developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the market for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Moreover, declines in the stock market in general, or stock values of financial institutions and their holding companies specifically, could adversely affect our stock performance.\nStrong competition for deposits and lending opportunities within our market areas, as well as competition from non-depository investment alternatives, may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market areas, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and to be profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our ability to compete successfully in our market areas. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, checking and savings account balances and other forms of deposits can decrease when our deposit customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market or other non-depository investments, as providing superior expected returns, or if our customers seek to spread their deposits over several banks to maximize FDIC insurance coverage. Furthermore, technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments, including products offered by other financial institutions or non-bank service providers. Additional increases in short-term interest rates could increase transfers of deposits to higher yielding deposits. Efforts and initiatives we undertake to retain and increase deposits, including deposit pricing, can increase our costs. When bank customers move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments or into higher-yielding deposits, or spread their accounts over several banks, we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, thus increasing our funding costs and reducing our profitability.\nFinancial reform legislation has increased our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the regulation of banks and savings institutions and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The current administration in Washington indicated they have plans for Dodd-Frank reform, however, we cannot predict the extent to how those changes will impact our business, operations or financial condition. However, compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations and policies has already resulted in changes to our business and operations, as well as additional costs, and diverted management\u2019s time from other business activities, which adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules may adversely affect our returns on equity and our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock.\nIn July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the rule established a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), set the leverage ratio at a uniform 4% of total assets, increased the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigned a higher risk weight (150%) to certain exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The rule limits a banking organization\u2019s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the banking organization does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of 2.50% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule became effective January 1, 2015. The \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d has been phased in beginning on January 1, 2016. It is currently 1.875% and will be fully phased in at 2.50% on January 1, 2019.\nThe application of these more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nGovernment responses to economic conditions may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of Blue Hills Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nFinancial reform legislation has changed the bank regulatory framework, created an independent consumer protection bureau that has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies, and established more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies. The legislation has also resulted in new regulations affecting the lending, funding, trading and investment activities of banks and bank holding companies. Bank regulatory agencies also have been responding aggressively to concerns and adverse trends identified in examinations. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the effect of new legislation and regulatory actions may adversely affect our operations by restricting our business activities, including our ability to originate or sell loans, modify loan terms, or foreclose on property securing loans. These measures are likely to increase our costs of doing business and may have a significant adverse effect on our lending activities, financial performance and operating flexibility. In addition, these risks could affect the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios, which also would negatively affect our financial performance.\nIn addition, there have been proposals made by members of Congress and others that would reduce the amount distressed borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution\u2019s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral. Were proposals such as these, or other proposals limiting our rights as a creditor, to be implemented, we could experience increased credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions and restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, and restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. During the last year, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nfor purposes of its regulations.\nChanges in the valuation of our securities portfolio could adversely affect us.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our investment securities portfolio, which includes government agency, mortgage-backed\nsecurities, and marketable equity securities totaled $313.4 million, or 11.7% of our total assets. Our securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer\u2019s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, industry analysts\u2019 reports and, to a lesser extent given the relatively insignificant levels of depreciation in our debt portfolio, spread differentials between the effective rates on instruments in the portfolio compared to risk-free rates. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The declines in fair value could result charges to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nWe may be adversely affected by recent changes in U.S. tax laws.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, include a number of provisions that will have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single-family residential real estate. Changes include (i) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (ii) the elimination of interest deductions for certain home equity loans, (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and (iv) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes.\nThe recent changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future, and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. In addition, these recent changes may also have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Material additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income. Furthermore, our strategic plan envisages significant growth in lending, which will require additional provisions for loan losses and reduce our earnings in the short term. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") has adopted Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, which will be effective in the first quarter of 2020. This standard, often referred to as \u201cCECL\u201d (reflecting a current expected credit loss model), will require companies to recognize an allowance for credit losses based on estimates of losses expected to be realized over the contractual lives of the loans. Under current U.S. GAAP, companies generally recognize credit losses only when it is probable that a loss has been incurred as of the balance sheet date. This new standard will require us to collect and review increased types and amounts of data for us to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are actively working through the provisions of the Update. Management has established a steering committee which has identified the methodologies and the additional data requirements necessary to implement the Update and has engaged a third-party software service provider to assist in the Company's implementation.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies are essential to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations. We could also be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which may result in our restating our prior period financial statements.\nIn January 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall, (Subtopic 825-10). The amendments in this Update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Targeted improvements to generally accepted accounting principles include the requirement for equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income and the elimination of the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The impact of the change, if applied, to the Company's equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2017, would have resulted in a gain of $1.7 million (pre-tax) being recognized in net income, after reclassification for the realized loss on mutual funds.\nTechnological advances impact our business.\nThe banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving customer services, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs provided that they produce economies of scale and deploy technology in a safe and sound manner. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and greater scale of operations to spread the costs of improvement over, creating a competitive advantage. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or successfully market such products and services to a large enough number of customers to cover the up-front costs of implementation and ongoing costs to operate.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business including systems operated by third party vendors. For example, we rely extensively on our core processing vendor for our informational management systems. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption, or security breach of our information systems, we cannot assure you that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately rectified. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, cause us to incur costs of rectification, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEvolving information technologies, the need to mitigate against and react to cyber-security risks and electronic fraud risks require significant resources and notwithstanding our investment in resources, we remain subject to cyber security risks and electronic fraud.\nThe Company needs to invest in information technology to keep pace with technology changes, and while the Company invests amounts it believes will be adequate, it may fail to invest adequate amounts such that the efficiency of information technology systems fails to meet operational needs. The risk of electronic fraudulent activity within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber attacks (crime committed through or involving the internet (phishing, hacking, denial of service attacks, stealing information, unauthorized intrusions into internal systems or the systems of the Company's third party vendors)) could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations or damage its reputation. The Company's information technology infrastructure and systems may be vulnerable to cyber terrorism, computer viruses, system failures and other intentional or unintentional interference, fraud and other unauthorized attempts to access or interfere with the systems. A breach of our security controls and the occurrence of one or more of these incidents could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, any such occurrences could result in regulatory actions (including fines), litigation, unexpected costs and expenses, third-party damages or other loss or liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition.\nOur performance depends on key personnel.\nOur performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior officers. Our business model depends on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and lending staff. Several of these individuals have been involved in the banking business for much of their professional careers. Our performance will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management and banking personnel. There can be no assurances that our management team will be able to manage our operations or our expected growth or that we will be able to attract and retain additional qualified personnel as needed in the future. The loss of any officer could adversely affect us. We do not currently maintain \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance on any of our officers.\nImpairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.\nGoodwill arises when a business is purchased for an amount greater than the fair market value of its net assets. We recognized goodwill as an asset on our balance sheet in connection with our acquisition of three branches in Nantucket in January 2014. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. A significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or other factors could result in impairment of goodwill. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill was necessary, then we would record the appropriate charge to earnings, which could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial position.", "PERMNO": 14792, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "BHBK"}
