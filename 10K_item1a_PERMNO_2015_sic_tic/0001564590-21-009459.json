debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\n\u2022\nChanges to, or the elimination of, LIBOR may adversely affect interest expense related to our indebtedness.\n\u2022\nFailure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets.\n\u2022\nOur leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\n\u2022\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to purchase or contract with third-party manufacturers for our theme park rides and attractions, or construction delays may occur and impact attraction openings.\n\u2022\nOur operations and our ownership of property subject us to environmental requirements, and to environmental expenditures and liabilities.\n\u2022\nDelays, restrictions, or inability to obtain or maintain permits for capital investments could impair our business.\n\u2022\nFinancial distress experienced by our strategic

results of operations or financial condition and may impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u2022\nOur stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\n\u2022\nWe cannot guarantee that our allocation of capital to various alternatives will enhance long-term stockholder value, and in some cases, our Share Repurchase Program could increase the volatility of the price of

evaluating us and this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d are forward-looking statements. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d elsewhere in this report:\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and will adversely affect our results of operations and various other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantines, significant travel warnings and restrictions, social distancing rules, curfews and shelter-in-place have been implemented and may be re-implemented pursuant to federal, state and local orders and mandates. From March 16, 2020 to June 5, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our theme parks and therefore, did not generate revenue from our parks during the closure period. Beginning on June 6, 2020, we began the phased reopening of some of our parks. Although some of our parks have been permitted to re-open with limited capacity, the extent and duration of any negative impacts over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time. It is also impossible to predict the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the impact of any mutations of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of any vaccine or containment actions taken, and the impact of these and other factors on travel and consumer behavior. It is possible that the spread of COVID-19, the resulting economic and societal impact, social distancing or other safety requirements existing today or that may be implemented will reduce our guests\u2019 interest or ability to visit our theme parks. The COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in response, pose the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. Restrictions on travel, quarantines and other measures imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ongoing concern regarding the virus\u2019 potential impact, have had and will likely continue to have a negative effect on economies and financial markets, including supply chain shortages and additional business disruptions. Any such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn response to our park closures, we took steps to minimize our cash outflows, manage costs and expenditures and maximize liquidity. Some of these measures included, but were not limited to (i) substantially reduced or deferred all capital projects while our parks were closed other than a minimal amount of essential projects and maintenance and postponed the opening of rides that were still under construction and scheduled to open in 2020; (ii) eliminated and/or deferred all non-essential operating expenses at all of our parks and corporate headquarters while the parks were closed and actively managing operating expenses; (iii) eliminated substantially all advertising and marketing spend while the parks were closed and strategically managing marketing spend as parks reopen; (iv) temporarily reduced Executive Officer base pay by 20% through November 2020; (v) worked with certain vendors and other business partners to manage, defer, and/or abate certain costs and payments; and (vi) initially furloughing approximately 95% of our employees upon closing all of our parks. It is unclear if any of these actions could have a lasting negative impact on our relationships with vendors, current and/or future business partners or ambassadors or, if parks are forced to close again, whether we will be forced to take similar actions and be able to achieve similar cost savings. We have been sued and may face additional lawsuits or damage to our reputation related to actions taken or not taken as a result of COVID-19 from current and/or future vendors, customers and/or ambassadors. The lawsuits could negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations; however none have been material to date. Also, another prolonged closure of our parks could materially impact our results, operations and financial condition. Additionally, due to the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impact on our business, we have made or may make future employment or restructuring decisions which may subject us to increased risks related to employment matters, including increased union organizing activity, litigation and/or claims for severance or other benefits.\nIn March 2020, we increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to increase our cash position and in April 2020 we issued $227.5 million aggregate principal amount of 8.750% first-priority senior secured notes due 2025 to raise capital and provide additional liquidity for a sustained period and to preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we entered into amendments to our Amended Credit Agreement to amend certain provisions therein. Pursuant to the most recent amendment, we will be exempt from complying with our first lien secured leverage ratio covenant through the end of 2021 and will be required to comply with a quarterly minimum liquidity coverage test (defined as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility) of not less than $75.0 million until the earlier of September 30, 2022 or the date we elect to use actual Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of calculating our financial maintenance covenant. There is no certainty we will be able to meet this test and failure to meet this test could result in events of default under our debt agreements, acceleration of our outstanding debt and materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. On August 5, 2020, we issued $500.0 million of 9.500% second-priority senior secured notes due 2025 which provided us with net proceeds of approximately $489.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents was approximately $433.9 million and $311.3 million was available under our revolving credit facility.\nWe cannot be certain that we will continue to have access to sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for the time required to allow our cash generating operations to normalize. The effect of COVID-19 on the capital markets could significantly impact our cost of borrowing and the availability of capital to us. COVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate the future performance of our business and/or our liquidity needs, particularly over the near to medium term. We may not be able to obtain additional liquidity and any relief provided by lenders, governmental agencies, and business partners may not be adequate and may include onerous terms.\nWe had never previously experienced a complete cessation of our operations, and as a consequence, our ability to be predictive regarding the impact of such a cessation on our operations and future prospects is uncertain. In addition, the magnitude, duration and speed of the global pandemic is uncertain. As a consequence, we cannot estimate the impact on our business, financial condition or near or longer-term financial or operational results with certainty. As we continue to make progress in the reopening of our theme parks, we may face additional costs and obstacles in complying with any new federal, state or local regulations or industry best practices established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, re-integrating our furloughed employees and attracting guests who may not wish to travel or visit our theme parks for a prolonged period. In addition, any measures we take or may be required to take such as limiting capacity in our theme parks, enforcing social distancing requirements and / or requiring masks, may negatively impact attendance at our theme parks. It is not possible to predict what steps, if any, we may be required to take if the COVID-19 pandemic worsens.\nIt is possible we could be forced to close some or all of our parks again. In fact, in compliance with revised state government restrictions issued late in the fourth quarter in California, we once again closed our SeaWorld park in California effective December 7, 2020. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. A single case of COVID-19 in a theme park could result in additional costs and further closures. If we do not continue to respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation, which could significantly adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the effects of the pandemic on our business could be long-lasting and could continue to have adverse effects, some of which may be significant, and which may indefinitely impact our ability to operate our business in the traditional, pre-pandemic manner.\nOur business also could be significantly affected should the disruptions caused by COVID-19 lead to systemic changes in consumer behavior. The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly increased economic uncertainty. It is possible that the current outbreak or continued spread of COVID-19 could cause a global recession, which could further adversely affect our business, and such adverse effects may be material. Further, our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted if we experience another prolonged period of closure, experience significant declines in business volumes, are unable to return to normalized performance levels or attendance at our parks is limited due to capacity restrictions.\nOur properties are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time. If there is a prolonged disruption at any of our properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will likely be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if a prolonged downturn of general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our guests or prevents guests from easily coming to our properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts.\nWe operate in a complex and evolving regulatory environment and are subject to various federal and state statutes and regulations and international treaties implemented by federal law. The states in which we operate also regulate zoological activity involving the import and export of exotic and native wildlife, endangered and/or otherwise protected species, zoological display and anti-cruelty statutes. We incur significant compliance costs in connection with these regulations and violation of such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and result in the loss of our licenses and permits, which, if occurred, could impact our ability to display certain animals. Future amendments to existing statutes, regulations and treaties or new statutes, regulations and treaties or lawsuits against the Company, government agencies or other third parties in the zoological industry may potentially restrict our ability to maintain our animals, or to acquire new ones to supplement or sustain our breeding programs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIn 2016, the California Orca Protection Act was enacted into law and (i) codified the end of captive breeding programs and the export and import of genetic materials for orcas in California, (ii) prohibits the import or export of new orcas into or existing orcas out of California, (iii) permits the transfer of orcas currently in California among existing SeaWorld facilities and (iv) requires educational presentations of orcas in California. We introduced new orca programs in our San Diego park in 2017 which are consistent with these standards. In the past, Congress has proposed legislation that would have impacted the breeding, the taking (wild capture), and the import or export of orcas for the purposes of public display and the transport of orcas from one park to another. Also, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (\u201cAPHIS\u201d) has proposed regulations that could impact our business. For example, APHIS included on the Fall 2020 Unified Agenda a notice that it was planning to release a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in June 2021 related to contingency plans for the handling of animals. This rulemaking would amend Animal Welfare Act regulations to add requirements for contingency planning and training of personnel by research facilities and by dealers,\nexhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers. APHIS says this action would heighten the awareness of licensees and registrants regarding their responsibilities and help ensure a timely and appropriate response should an emergency or disaster occur. There can be no assurance that Congress will not pass legislation or that APHIS or other federal, state or local jurisdictions will not propose or enact additional laws or regulations that could materially impact the Company in the future.\nIn light of the uncertain legal, legislative and regulatory environment and evolving public sentiment, we continue to evaluate a broad spectrum of enhancements, modifications and alternatives with respect to the display, husbandry and breeding practices, handling and care, and study and research of our orcas and other marine animals. Any decisions regarding such matters are subject to consideration and assessment of various factors including, but not limited to, the health and welfare of the animals, guest sentiment, market conditions, anticipated impact on our business, regulatory environment, legal proceedings, and input from our conservation partners, and other factors. If we were to pursue or be required to pursue any alternative approaches with respect to the display, husbandry and breeding practices, handling and care, or study and research of our orcas or other animals in our zoological collection, the full impact of such alternatives on our business will not be known until such alternatives are finalized. In the meantime, we continue to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate the impact of and ensure compliance with the applicable regulatory and other developments.\nWe are subject to scrutiny by activist and other third-party groups and/or media who can pressure governmental agencies, vendors, partners, and/or regulators, bring action in the courts or create negative publicity about us.\nFrom time to time, animal activist and other third-party groups may make claims before government agencies, bring lawsuits against us, and/or attempt to generate negative publicity associated with our business. Such activities sometimes are based on allegations that we do not properly care for some of our animals. On other occasions, such activities are specifically designed to change existing law or enact new law in order to impede our ability to retain, exhibit, acquire or breed animals. While we seek to structure our operations to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and vigorously defend ourselves when sued, there are no assurances as to the outcome of claims and lawsuits that could be brought against us or new laws or changes to existing laws that could negatively impact us. Even if not successful, these lawsuits, or proposed changes to laws, can require deployment of our resources and can lead to negative publicity.\nNegative publicity created by activists or in the media could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. At times, activists and other third-party groups have also attempted to generate negative publicity related to our relationships with our business partners, such as corporate sponsors, promotional partners, vendors, ticket resellers and others. These activities have at times led relationships with some ticket resellers to be terminated. Although sales from any particular ticket reseller may not constitute a significant portion of our ticket sales, if a relationship with a ticket reseller is terminated, we will attempt to find alternative distribution channels. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that those channels will be as successful or not have additional costs. If we are unable to find cost effective alternative distribution channels, the loss of multiple ticket resellers could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nVarious factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks.\nVarious factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. These factors could also affect our suppliers, vendors, insurance carriers and other contractual counterparties. Such factors include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nbad weather and even forecasts of bad weather, including abnormally hot, cold, snow/ice and/or wet weather, particularly during weekends, holidays or other peak periods;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, floods and volcanic eruptions and man-made disasters such as oil spills, which may deter travelers from scheduling vacations or cause them to cancel travel or vacation plans;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates;\n\u2022\nlow consumer confidence;\n\u2022\noutbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases or consumers\u2019 concerns relating to potential exposure to travel-related health concerns such as pandemics and epidemics such as Coronavirus, Ebola, Zika, Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu, SARS and MERS;\n\u2022\nchanges in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of both our domestic and international guests;\n\u2022\noil prices and travel costs and the financial condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries, any travel-related disruptions or incidents and their impact on travel or decrease transportation options to cities where we have parks;\n\u2022\nwar, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events;\n\u2022\nactions or statements by U.S. and foreign governmental officials related to travel and corporate travel-related activities (including changes to the U.S. visa rules or disease related restrictions or testing requirements) and the resulting public perception of such travel and activities; and\n\u2022\ninterruption of public or private utility services to our theme parks.\nAny one or more of these factors could adversely affect attendance, revenue, and per capita spending at our theme parks, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our business. A strong dollar increases the cost for international tourists and could impact their spending. In addition, demand for our parks is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism, which can be significantly adversely affected by extreme weather events, including ice and snow conditions. Any of these such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, because many of the attractions at our parks are outdoors, attendance at our parks is adversely affected by bad or extreme weather conditions and forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions, which negatively affects our revenues and results of operations. For example, attendance at our parks in 2019 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Dorian over Labor Day weekend. Separately, we have previously also experienced negative impacts from weather events in other parks, particularly hurricanes, which have caused park closures in Tampa and Orlando and park closures and other weather impacts in Texas and Virginia.\nIncidents or adverse publicity concerning our theme parks, the theme park industry or zoological facilities generally could harm our brands or reputation as well as negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nOur brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality and safety of our theme parks and services and our corporate and management integrity. The operation of theme parks involves the risk of accidents, illnesses, environmental incidents and other incidents which may negatively affect the perception of guest and employee safety, health, security and guest satisfaction and which could negatively impact our brands or reputation and our business and results of operations. An accident or an injury at any of our theme parks or at theme parks operated by competitors, particularly an accident or an injury involving the safety of guests and employees, that receives media attention, is the topic of a book, film, documentary or is otherwise the subject of public discussions, may harm our brands or reputation, cause a loss of consumer confidence in the Company, reduce attendance at our theme parks and negatively impact our results of operations. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. In addition, other types of adverse publicity concerning our business, the theme park industry or zoological facilities generally could harm our brands, reputation, and results of operations. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. There has been and may continue to be perception issues and negative media attention that create a barrier to attendance at our parks which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by a decline in discretionary consumer spending or consumer confidence.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is heavily influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. In the past, severe economic downturns, coupled with high volatility and uncertainty as to the future global economic landscape, have had an adverse effect on consumers\u2019 discretionary income and consumer confidence.\nVolatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions and recessionary periods may adversely impact attendance figures, the frequency with which guests choose to visit our theme parks and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. The actual or perceived weakness in the economy could also lead to decreased spending by our guests. For example, in 2009 and 2010, we experienced a decline in attendance as a result of the global economic crisis, which in turn adversely affected our revenue and profitability. Both attendance and total revenue per capita spending at our theme parks are key drivers of our revenue and profitability, and reductions in either can materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues are historically generated in the States of Florida, California and Virginia. Any risks affecting such markets, such as natural disasters, severe weather and travel-related disruptions or incidents, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2020, more than 70% of our revenues were generated in the State of Florida, due in part to the temporary park closures and limited operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, however, more than 50% of our revenues are generated in the State of Florida with approximately 30% of our revenues generated from the States of California and Virginia combined.\nAny risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as the occurrence of natural disasters and travel-related disruptions or incidents, affecting the States of Florida, California and Virginia generally may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, especially if they have the effect of decreasing attendance at our theme parks or, in extreme cases, cause us to close any of our theme parks for any period of time. For example, in 2019, Florida was negatively impacted by Hurricane Dorian. Also, our parks in Texas and Virginia have previously been negatively impacted by hurricanes. Although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events by implementing our hurricane preparedness plan, our theme parks located in Orlando and Tampa, Florida and in Williamsburg, Virginia have previously experienced closures as a result of storms, which negatively impacted attendance and results of operations.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nWe have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our annual theme park attendance and revenue, which are typically higher in our second and third quarters, partly because seven of our theme parks have historically only opened for a portion of the year. Historically, approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues are generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we typically incur a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. In addition, the timing of school vacations and school start dates also cause fluctuations in our quarterly theme park attendance and revenue. For example, revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our five theme parks that have historically been open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Changes in school calendars that impact traditional school vacation breaks could also impact attendance patterns. Due in part to the temporary park closures, capacity limitations and modified/limited operations, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the seasonality of our business for 2020 and it is difficult to estimate how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact seasonality in the future.\nFurthermore, the operating season at some of our theme parks, including SeaWorld San Antonio, Aquatica San Antonio, Adventure Island, Aquatica San Diego, Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Water Country USA and Sesame Place, is of limited duration. In addition, historically most of our expenses for maintenance and costs of adding new attractions at our seasonal theme parks are incurred when the operating season is over, which may increase the need for borrowing to fund such expenses during such periods.\nWhen conditions or events described in this Risk Factor section occur during the operating season, particularly during the second and third quarters, there is only a limited period of time during which the impact of those conditions or events can be mitigated. Accordingly, such conditions or events may have a disproportionately adverse effect on our revenues and cash flow.\nBecause we operate in a competitive industry, our revenues, profits or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively.\nOur theme parks compete with other theme, water and amusement parks and with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, family entertainment centers, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel.\nPrincipal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments ltd., Herschend Family Entertainment and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. The principal competitive factors of a theme park include location, price, originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of its food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), and availability and cost of transportation to a theme park. Certain of our direct competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do, and they may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in guest preferences or devote greater resources to their attractions or promotion of their offerings and attractions than us. Our competitors may be able to attract guests to their theme parks in lieu of our own through the development or acquisition of new rides, attractions or shows that are perceived by guests to be of a higher quality and entertainment value. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully against such competitors. If we are unable to compete with new and existing attractions, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nFeaturing animals at our theme parks involves risks.\nOur theme parks feature numerous displays and interactions that include animals. All animal enterprises involve some degree of risk. All animal interactions by our employees and our guests in attractions in our theme parks, where offered, involves risk. While we maintain strict safety procedures for the protection of our employees and guests, injuries or death, while rare, have occurred in the past. For example, in February 2010, a trainer was killed while engaged in an interaction with an orca. Following this incident, we were subject to an inspection by the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), which resulted in citations concerning alleged violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and certain regulations thereunder. In connection with this incident, we reviewed and revised our safety protocols and made certain safety-related facility enhancements such as revising training protocols used in animal presentations. This incident has also been and continues to be the subject of significant media attention, including extensive television and newspaper coverage, books, at least one documentary and discussions in social media. This incident and similar events that may occur in the future may harm our reputation, reduce attendance and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance of the type and in amounts that we believe are commercially reasonable and that are available to animal enterprise related businesses in the theme park industry. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any self-insurance retention or co-insurance applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available, the availability of coverage for specific risks, or whether insurance we do maintain will be sufficient.\nAnimals in our care are important to our theme parks, and they could be exposed to infectious diseases.\nMany of our theme parks are distinguished from those of our competitors in that we offer guest interactions with animals in our care. Individual animals, specific species of animals or groups of animals in our zoological collection could be exposed to infectious diseases or could expose guests to infectious diseases. While we have never had any such experiences, an outbreak of an infectious disease among any animals in our theme parks or the public\u2019s perception that a certain disease could be harmful to human health may materially adversely affect our zoological collection, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe high fixed cost structure of theme park operations can result in significantly lower margins if revenues decline.\nA large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed because the costs for employees, maintenance, animal care, utilities, advertising, and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance. These fixed costs may increase at a greater rate than our revenues and may not be able to be reduced at the same rate as declining revenues. If cost-cutting efforts are insufficient to offset declines in revenues or are impracticable, we could experience a material decline in margins, revenues, profitability and reduced or negative cash flows. Such effects can be especially pronounced during a pandemic or periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth.\nChanges in consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of our business.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to consistently provide, maintain, and expand theme park attractions as well as create online material and consumer products that meet changing consumer preferences. In addition, consumers from outside the United States constitute an important portion of our theme park attendance, and our success depends in part on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to tastes and preferences of this consumer group. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if consumer preferences change, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of internal or guest data could result in damages to our reputation, the disruption of operations and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nWe collect internal and customer data for business purposes. This data may include personal identifiable information held in our various information technology systems which collect, process, summarize, and report such data. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our guests and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on us by the credit card industry, governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act took effect in January 2020 and imposes requirements for identifying, managing, securing, tracking, producing and deleting consumer privacy information in California. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our theme parks, products, and services to our guests. We also rely on accounting, financial and operational management information technology systems to conduct our operations. If these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face security threats, including but not limited to cyber security attacks on our data infrastructure. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems and the training of our employees and we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate technological threats. There can be no assurance that these procedures, investments and/or controls will be sufficient to prevent penetrations, malicious acts or disruptions to our systems. Furthermore, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of guest, employee, company or protected data which could harm our reputation or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits and require significant management attention and resources to be spent. In addition, our insurance coverage and indemnification arrangements that we enter into, if any, may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. To date, cyber security attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. Due to the evolving nature of security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nTechnology interruptions or failures that impair access to our websites or information technology systems could adversely affect our business or operations.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our web sites and our infrastructure are critical to the conduct of our business. Any system interruptions that result in the unavailability or slowness of our websites could impact our ability to market or sell admissions or other products which could adversely affect our results of operations and/or result in negative publicity. We have in the past experienced, or may in the future experience, temporary system interruptions for a variety of reasons, including security incidents, viruses, telecommunication and other network failures, power failures, programming errors, undetected bugs, design faults, data corruption, denial-of-service attacks, legacy systems, poor scalability or network overload from an overwhelming number of traffic trying to reach our websites at the same time. Even a disruption as brief as a few minutes could have a negative impact on our online activities and could result in a loss of revenue. For example, there have been instances when our websites experienced slow performance and unavailability for some guests. Although these issues were short-lived and did not have a material impact to our results of operations, prolonged or repeat system interruptions and network failures could adversely impact our operations as a significant portion of our admissions revenues are from ticket purchases and reservations made online.\nAdditionally, damage, failures or interruptions to our information technology systems may require a significant investment to update, remediate or replace with alternate systems, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and/or result in negative publicity. Any material interruptions or failures in our systems, including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop, implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nIncreased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefit costs or otherwise, would adversely impact our operating expenses. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the amendments thereto contain provisions that have impacted our healthcare costs. Additionally, the new administration is encouraging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Any future amendments or new legislation could significantly increase our compensation costs, which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.\nIn 2016, San Diego passed legislation which, after the first increase on January 1, 2017, increases its minimum wage over a six-year period to $15 an hour by January 1, 2023. After the San Diego minimum wage reaches $15 an hour, it will change based on the consumer price index. Virginia passed legislation that increases the state minimum wage to $9.50 an hour on May 1, 2021 and increases its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026. In November 2020, Florida passed a ballot initiative raising minimum wage to $10.00 per hour effective September 30th, 2021. Each September 30th thereafter, minimum wage shall increase by $1.00 per hour until the minimum wage reaches $15.00 per hour on September 30th, 2026. From that point forward, future minimum wage increases shall revert to being adjusted annually for inflation starting September 30th, 2027. In addition, a number of companies with whom we compete for talent have announced wage increases. Increases to the minimum wage in locations where we do business, wages of companies from whom we compete for talent and/or increased benefit costs will negatively impact our operating expenses.\nOur growth strategy may not achieve the anticipated results.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to grow our business, including through capital investments to improve existing and develop or acquire additional theme parks, rides, attractions and shows, as well as in-park product offerings and product offerings outside of our theme parks that are complementary to our parks. Our growth and innovation strategies require significant commitments of management resources and capital investments and may not grow our revenues at the rate we expect or at all. As a result, we may not be able to recover the costs incurred in developing our new projects and initiatives or to realize their intended or projected benefits, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to fund theme park capital expenditures and investment in future attractions and projects.\nA principal competitive factor for a theme park is the originality and perceived quality of its rides and attractions. We need to make continued capital investments through maintenance and the regular addition of new rides and attractions. Our ability to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to raise capital from third parties. We cannot assure you that our operations will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such costs, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on adequate terms, or at all, which could cause us to delay or abandon certain projects or plans.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business.\nWe are subject to allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business, which may include claims by third parties, including guests who visit our theme parks, our employees, stockholders and/or regulators. We are currently subject to securities litigation. We are also subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (\u201cAPHIS\u201d), the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cCal-OSHA\u201d), state departments of labor, the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (\u201cFWC\u201d), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). From time to time, various parties may also bring lawsuits against us. For example, on February 11, 2020, we announced that we had entered into a settlement agreement with respect to a previously disclosed class action lawsuit commenced in 2014, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., et al., Case No. 14-CV-02129-MMA (AGS) (\u201cBaker\u201d). The settlement required us to pay $65.0 million for claims alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the costs of administration and legal fees and expenses. The settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by us or any defendant.\nAlso, in June 2017, we received a subpoena in connection with an investigation by the DOJ concerning certain disclosures and public statements made by us and certain individuals on or before August 2014, and trading in our securities. We also had received subpoenas from the staff of the SEC in connection with these matters. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we reached a settlement with the SEC. In connection with the settlement, without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, we agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering us to pay a civil penalty of $4.0 million and enjoining us from violation of certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and certain rules thereunder. The settlement was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 24, 2018. On December 11, 2018, the DOJ informed us that it does not intend to take any action against us or any individuals in connection with its investigation. We consider the DOJ matter concluded. We discuss securities litigation and other litigation to which we are subject in greater detail in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any proceedings, audits, inspections or investigations were to be determined adversely against us or resulted in legal actions, claims, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or judgments, fines, or settlements involving a payment of material sums of money, or if injunctive relief were issued against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Even the successful defense of legal proceedings may cause us to incur substantial legal costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could adversely affect our business.\nOur intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patent and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of our value. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third-party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in any given case, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We may be unable to prevent the misappropriation, infringement or violation of our intellectual property rights, breaching any contractual obligations to us, or independently developing intellectual property that is similar to ours, any of which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, adversely affect our revenues or otherwise harm our business.\nWe have obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign trademark and service mark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and service marks or other intellectual property, as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. A failure to obtain registrations for our intellectual property in the United States and other countries could limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions.\nWe are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property rights. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome, costly and divert the attention of our personnel, and we may not prevail. In addition, any repeal or weakening of laws or enforcement in the United States or internationally intended to protect intellectual property rights could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, negatively impacting their value and increasing the cost of enforcing our rights.\nWe may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and result in the loss of significant intellectual property rights.\nWe cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of our business based on allegations of infringement or other violations of the intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims can divert the efforts of our personnel and are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial money damages or discontinue, modify, or rename certain products or services that are found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license (if available on acceptable terms, or at all) to continue offering products and services, which may significantly increase our operating expenses.\nIf we lose licenses and permits required to exhibit animals and/or violate laws and regulations, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe are required to hold government licenses and permits, some of which are subject to yearly or periodic renewal, for purposes of possessing, exhibiting, and maintaining animals. Although our theme parks\u2019 licenses and permits have always been renewed in the past, in the event that any of our licenses or permits are not renewed or any of our licenses or permits are revoked, portions of the affected theme park might not be able to remain open for purpose of displaying or retaining the animals covered by such license or permit. Such an outcome could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to periodic inspections by federal and state agencies and the subsequent issuance of inspection reports. While we believe that we comply with, or exceed, requisite care and maintenance standards that apply to our animals, government inspectors can cite us for alleged statutory or regulatory violations. In unusual instances when we are cited for an alleged deficiency, we are most often given the opportunity to correct any purported deficiencies without penalty. It is possible, however, that in some cases a federal or state regulator could seek to impose monetary fines on us. In the past, when we have been subjected to governmental claims for fines, the amounts involved were not material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, while unlikely, we cannot predict whether any future fines that regulators might seek to impose would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, many of the statutes under which we operate allow for the imposition of criminal sanctions. While neither of the foregoing situations are likely to occur, either could negatively affect the business, financial condition or results of operations at our theme parks.\nIf we lose key personnel, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon a number of key employees, including members of our senior management team who have extensive experience in the industry. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could adversely affect our business and our future success. Changes in our management team and to the Board of Directors, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business, and any additional changes to the management team or the Board of Directors could have a negative impact on our ability to manage and grow our business effectively. In addition, if we are not effective in our succession planning, it may have a negative impact on our ability to successfully recruit for our management team. Any such disruption or uncertainty or difficulty in efficiently and effectively filling key management roles could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or the price of our common stock.\nUnionization activities or labor disputes may disrupt our operations and affect our profitability.\nAlthough none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If some or all of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a labor dispute involving some or all of our employees may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs.\nAlthough we maintain binding policies that require employees to submit to a mandatory alternative dispute resolution procedure in lieu of other remedies, as employers, we may be subject to various employment-related claims, such as individual or class actions or government enforcement actions relating to alleged employment discrimination, employee classification and related withholding, wage-hour, labor standards or healthcare and benefit issues. Such actions, if brought against us and successful in whole or in part, may affect our ability to compete or materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to meet our workforce needs.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with our needs, including employees with certain specialized skills in the field of animal training and care. If we are unable to do so, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we employ a significant seasonal workforce. We recruit year-round to fill thousands of seasonal staffing positions each season and work to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place. There is no assurance that we will be able to recruit and hire adequate seasonal personnel as the business requires or that we will not experience material increases in the cost of securing our seasonal workforce in the future. Increased seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See also, \u201cIncreased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations.\u201d\nWe may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives and we may incur significant costs associated with such activities.\nOur business strategy may include selective expansion, both domestically and internationally, through acquisitions of assets or other strategic initiatives, such as joint ventures, that allow us to profitably expand our business and leverage our brands. For example, in 2016 we announced our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island. There is no assurance that the Miral partnership or our other strategic initiatives will be successful. In addition, on March 24, 2017, we entered into a Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement and a Center Concept & Preliminary Design Support Agreement with an affiliate of ZHG Group to provide design, support and advisory services for various potential projects and granting exclusive rights in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (collectively, the \u201cZHG Agreements\u201d). The ZHG Agreements were terminated in April 2019 as a result of the contract party\u2019s defaulting on the payment of required amounts under these agreements.\nAny international transactions and partnerships are subject to additional risks, including foreign and U.S. regulations on the import and export of animals, the impact of economic fluctuations in economies outside of the United States, difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations due to distance, language and cultural differences, as well as political instability and lesser degree of legal protection in certain jurisdictions, currency exchange fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences of overseas operations. In addition, the success of any acquisition depends on effective integration of acquired businesses and assets into our operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of acquired businesses or assets.\nWe are executing on a strategic plan to grow revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and, from time to time, identify and execute on cost reduction opportunities and take other actions designed to achieve operational efficiencies and process improvements. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve and/or sustain the cost savings, grow our business, realize or sustain operational efficiencies or achieve other benefits that we may initially expect. In addition, such actions may result in various one-time costs and temporary operational inefficiencies and could negatively impact business and employment relationships during transitional periods. See further discussion under the caption \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Principal Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations-Costs and Expenses\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we are unable to maintain certain commercial licenses, our business, reputation and brand could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a license from Sesame to use the Sesame Place trade name and trademark and certain other intellectual property rights, including titles, marks, characters, logos and designs from the Sesame Street television series within our Sesame Place theme park located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the \u201cLanghorne Sesame Place\u201d), the Sesame Place theme park we announced that will be opened in California and any additional future Sesame Place theme parks in the United States (collectively, the \u201cStandalone Parks\u201d) and with respect to Sesame Street themed areas within certain areas of some of our other theme parks, as well as in connection with the sales of certain Sesame Street themed products. The License Agreement with Sesame Workshop (the \u201cSesame License Agreement\u201d) has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15-year extension plus a 5-year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Our use of these intellectual property rights is subject to the approval of Sesame and the parties have certain termination rights under the Sesame License Agreement, including without limitation Sesame\u2019s right to terminate the Sesame License Agreement in whole or in part under certain limited circumstances, including a change of control of SeaWorld (or of SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SeaWorld), our bankruptcy or uncured breach of the Sesame License Agreement, or the termination of the Sesame License Agreement regarding the Langhorne Sesame Place theme park. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate the Sesame License Agreement, our business may be adversely affected.\nABI is the owner of the Busch Gardens trademarks and domain names. ABI has granted us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of certain of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. Under the license, we are required to indemnify ABI against losses related to our use of the marks. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate this license, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur existing debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur existing debt agreements contain, and documents governing our future indebtedness may contain, financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and other distributions, make capital expenditures, make certain loans, investments and other restricted payments, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, engage in certain transactions with stockholders or affiliates, sell certain assets or engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, amend or otherwise alter the terms of our indebtedness, alter the business that we conduct, guarantee indebtedness or incur other contingent obligations and create liens. Our existing debt agreements also require, and documents governing our future indebtedness may require, us to meet certain financial ratios and tests. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the existing debt agreements is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or non-compliance with any of these financial ratios and tests could result in an event of default under the existing debt agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. We discuss certain key covenants and financial ratios to which we are subject under our debt agreements in greater detail under the caption \u201cRestrictive Covenants\u201d in Note 11-Long-Term Debt to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Our Indebtedness-Covenant Compliance\u201d. Additionally, variable rate indebtedness subjects us to the risk of higher interest rates, which could cause our future debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nChanges to, or the elimination of, LIBOR may adversely affect interest expense related to our indebtedness.\nBorrowings under our Term B-5 Loans which mature on March 31, 2024, and the Revolving Credit Facility which matures on October 31, 2023 are currently based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, stated that it will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rates indices. The FCA has indicated it will support the LIBOR indices through 2021, to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate any credit agreements or any hedge transactions extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. Also, if we intend to hedge our LIBOR denominated debt, we cannot predict whether hedging opportunities will exist on acceptable terms. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was charged with determining a replacement for LIBOR, has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), as its recommended alternative to LIBOR. Subsequent to that recommendation, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging which includes SOFR as a permitted rates that can be used in the application of hedge accounting pursuant to adoption of the standard (see Note-3 Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion). The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. The market transition away from LIBOR is expected to be gradual and complicated, and to include the development of term and credit adjustments to accommodate differences between LIBOR and SOFR. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become widely used or that alternatives may be developed without additional complications. We are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a possible transition from LIBOR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets.\nMoody\u2019s Investor Service and Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services routinely evaluate our debt and issue ratings on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. Due to changes in these factors, the pandemic and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets.\nFor example, as of December 31, 2020, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities were rated by Standard and Poor\u2019s Financial Services (corporate credit rated B- with a negative outlook and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities rated B-) and Moody\u2019s Investors Service (corporate family rated B3 with a negative outlook and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities rated B2). We disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of these ratings on our costs of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, could increase our borrowing costs.\nOur leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness was approximately $2.220 billion. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and/or share repurchases of our common stock; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) certain of the borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which will increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates; (iv) we are at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors; (v) we may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions; (vi) the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and (vii) we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth. We do not currently have any of our debt hedged. A hypothetical increase in LIBOR of 100 bps would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $5.9 million. Increased debt service costs would adversely affect our cash flow and net income. There can be no assurance that if we intend to enter into a hedge, that we will be able to enter into hedging arrangements on favorable terms or at all.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. If unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. There can be no assurance that any refinancing of our indebtedness will be possible and any such refinancing could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. We from time to time may increase the amount of our indebtedness, modify the terms of our financing arrangements, make capital expenditures, issue dividends and take other actions that may substantially increase our leverage.\nDespite our significant leverage, we may incur additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase. Although we maintain various safety and loss prevention programs and carry property and casualty insurance to cover certain risks, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities. Additionally, many of our policies are subject to deductibles and/or self-insured retentions and co-insurance. There can be no assurance our insurance will be sufficient to cover the full extent of all losses or liabilities for which we are insured and may be significantly less than the expected and actual replacement cost of rebuilding facilities \u201cas was\u201d if there was a total loss. For example, we expect the majority of losses related to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will not be covered by insurance available to us and insurers may contest coverage. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, if we or other theme park operators sustain significant losses or make significant insurance claims, then our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to purchase or contract with third-party manufacturers for our theme park rides and attractions, or construction delays may occur and impact attraction openings.\nWe may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to build high quality rides and attractions and to continue to service and maintain those rides and attractions at competitive or beneficial prices, or to provide the replacement parts needed to maintain the operation of such rides. In addition, if our third-party suppliers\u2019 financial condition deteriorates or they go out of business, we may not be able to obtain the full benefit of manufacturer warranties or indemnities typically contained in our contracts or may need to incur greater costs for the maintenance, repair, replacement or insurance of these assets. We may also incur unanticipated construction delays in completing capital projects which could adversely affect ride or attraction opening dates which could impact our attendance or revenues. Further, when rides and/or attractions have downtime and/or closures, our attendance or revenue could be adversely affected.\nOur operations and our ownership of property subject us to environmental requirements, and to environmental expenditures and liabilities.\nWe incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to water use, wastewater and storm water management and disposal, air emissions control, hazardous materials management, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the clean-up of properties affected by regulated materials.\nWe have been required and continue to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases, and other releases, from current or formerly owned or operated facilities. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we generate, use and dispose of large volumes of water, including saltwater, which requires us to comply with a number of federal, state and local regulations and to incur significant expenses. Failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and/or require us to incur additional expenses. Although we are not now classified as a large quantity generator of hazardous waste, we do store and handle hazardous materials to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities and have done so historically.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial costs to comply with new or expanded environmental requirements in the future or to investigate or clean-up new or newly identified environmental conditions, which could also impair our ability to use or transfer the affected properties and to obtain financing.\nDelays, restrictions, or inability to obtain or maintain permits for capital investments could impair our business.\nOur capital investments require regulatory permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to improve existing or build new theme parks, rides, attractions and shows. Such permits are typically issued by state agencies, but federal and local governmental permits may also be required. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location of such capital investments. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Therefore, our capital investments in certain areas may be delayed, interrupted, or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a loss of revenue to us, increasing cost, and/or adversely affecting our results of operations.\nFinancial distress experienced by our strategic partners or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us.\nWe are party to numerous contracts of varying durations. Certain of our agreements are comprised of a mixture of firm and non-firm commitments, varying tenures, and varying renewal terms, among other terms. There can be no guarantee that, upon the expiration of our contracts, we will be able to renew such contracts on terms as favorable to us, or at all.\nAlthough we attempt to assess the creditworthiness of our strategic partners and other contract counterparties, there can be no assurance as to the creditworthiness of any such strategic partner or contract counterparty. Financial distress experienced by our strategic partners or other counterparties could have an adverse impact in the event such parties are unable to pay us for the services we provide or otherwise fulfill their contractual obligations.\nWe are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by such strategic partners or other counterparties. Some of these counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating, market and regulatory risks, and some are experiencing, or may experience in the future, severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. For example, we terminated the ZHG Agreements for non-payment of undisputed amounts owed. In addition, the sale or transfer of our common stock owned by affiliates of Hill Path, or the perception that such sales or transfers could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock.\nAny material nonpayment or nonperformance from our contract counterparties due to inability or unwillingness to perform or adhere to contractual arrangements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to its stockholders. Furthermore, in the case of financially distressed strategic partners, such events might otherwise force such strategic partners to curtail their commercial relationships with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nGoodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nOur operations are capital intensive and require significant investment in long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and other long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. We review goodwill and intangible assets at least annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in park performance, adverse competitive conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict our activities or affect the services we offer, challenges to the validity of our intellectual property and a variety of other factors. For example, in 2017 due to financial performance at the time at our SeaWorld Orlando park, we determined a triggering event had occurred that required an interim goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the interim goodwill impairment test, we concluded that the goodwill for the SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit was fully impaired which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $269.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. There is no assurance that we will not experience similar asset impairments in the future. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), was enacted on December 22, 2017, and contains a number of changes to U.S. federal tax laws. The Tax Act requires complex computations that were not previously provided for under U.S. tax law and significantly revised the U.S. tax code by, among other changes, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and imposing limitations on the deductibility of interest. Additional guidance may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, the Department of the Treasury, or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\nTariffs or other trade restrictions could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe purchase some of our merchandise for resale and other products used in our business from entities which are located in foreign countries. Additionally, some of our ride manufacturers may be located in foreign countries or utilize components manufactured or sourced from foreign countries. These relationships expose us to risks associated with doing business globally, including changes in tariffs, quotas and other restrictions on imports (collectively, \u201cTrade Restrictions\u201d). The United States has increased tariffs on certain imports from China and other countries. While the current tariffs have not had a material impact on goods that we currently either import from China or purchase from domestic vendors which import from China, we cannot predict how any future tariffs or any other Trade Restrictions will impact our business. Such Trade Restrictions would likely result in lower gross margin on impacted products or increase the cost of capital projects, unless we are able to take successfully any one or more of the following mitigating actions: increase our prices, move production to countries with no or lower tariffs or away from domestic vendors who source from China or other tariff impacted countries, or alter or cease offering certain products. Any increase in pricing, alteration of products or reduced product offering could reduce the competitiveness of our products. Furthermore, any retaliatory counter-measures imposed by countries subject to such tariffs, could increase our, or our vendors\u2019, import expenses. Additionally, even if the products we import are not directly impacted by tariffs, the imposition and maintenance of such tariffs on goods imported into the United States could cause increased prices for consumer goods, in general, which could have a negative impact on consumer spending for discretionary items reducing attendance or spending at our parks. These direct and indirect impacts of increased tariffs or Trade Restrictions implemented by the United States, both individually and cumulatively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of future operations.\nActions of activist stockholders, and such activism could adversely impact the value of our securities.\nWe value constructive input from our stockholders and the investment community. Our Board and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by our Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could also interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan and our long-term growth. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction caused by activist actions could affect the market price of our securities, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, board members and business partners. In addition, any interference with our annual meeting process, including but not limited to a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting, could require us to incur significant legal and other advisory fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our Board.\nAffiliates of Hill Path Capital LP could be able to significantly influence our decisions and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nIn 2019, Hill Path Capital LP and certain of its affiliates (\u201cHill Path\u201d) purchased in the aggregate, 13,214,000 shares of our common stock (the \u201cHP Purchase\u201d). As described more fully in our Form 8-K dated May 27, 2019, we concurrently entered into the Stockholders Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Undertaking Agreement (collectively, the \u201cHP Agreements\u201d) with Hill Path in connection with the HP Purchase. On July 2, 2020, Hill Path filed with the SEC a Schedule 13D/A (the \u201cSchedule 13D/A\u201d) reporting that such persons had accumulated a total of 27,205,306 shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 34.7% of our total outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2020. Also, certain funds affiliated with Hill Path have other economic interests in the Company. Please refer to their most recent Schedule 13D/A. In addition, the Hill Path Schedule 13D filed on May 1, 2017, as amended states, among other things, that Hill Path may suggest changes in our business, operations, capital structure, capital allocation, corporate governance, and other strategic matters.\nUnder the HP Agreements, we agreed to appoint up to three Hill Path director designees (\u201cHill Path Designees\u201d) to our Board of Directors of which two directors may be affiliated with Hill Path and, subject to the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange, there shall be one Hill Path Designee on each committee of the Board, as determined by Hill Path and subject to the approval of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Scott Ross, founder of Hill Path, James Chambers, a Partner at Hill Path, and Charles Koppelman, who is independent, are the Hill Path Designees. Mr. Ross currently serves as Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Compensation Committee and also serves on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Revenue Committee. Mr. Chambers serves as Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and also serves on the Compensation Committee and the Revenue Committee. Mr. Koppelman serves on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Revenue Committee.\nFor so long as Hill Path Designees remain on our Board, Hill Path will have influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers, and nominees for director. In addition, for so long as Hill Path continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, Hill Path will be able to influence the composition of our Board of Directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. For example, for so long as Hill Path continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, Hill Path may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our Company or a change in the composition of our Board of Directors occurs. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe policies of the recently elected U.S. President and his administration or any changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition and may impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards.\nWhile the new administration\u2019s policies in many areas are uncertain at this time, certain types of policies regarding increases in minimum wage, foreign travel to the United States, foreign trade, domestic travel, changes to labor laws or regulations, manufacturing, development, investment and environment or animal welfare matters could adversely affect our business. Additionally, policies that strengthen the U.S. dollar against a variety of foreign currencies could impact international tourist spending, including at our theme parks. While there is currently a substantial lack of clarity and uncertainty around the likelihood, timing and details of any such policies and reforms, such policies and reforms may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of our securities. For example, a proposed corporate tax bill includes, among other changes, an increase in the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and a minimum tax of 15% on book net income for corporations with $100 million or higher in book profits. The President signed an Executive Order with the goal of increasing the minimum wage for federal workers and contractors to $15.00 an hour. Additionally, the new administration is encouraging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage to $15.00 an hour.\nSeparately, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, contained a number of changes to U.S. federal tax laws. The Tax Act, among other changes, imposed limitations on the deductibility of interest, limited the use of net operating loss carryforwards arising in periods after 2017, and extended the expiration period for net operating losses from 20 years to an unlimited period. Additionally, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) temporarily revised the U.S. tax code by, among other changes, deferring the 2020 employer portion of social security payments, implementing an employee retention credit, and allowing for 100% utilization of net operating loss carryforwards against 2020 taxable income. On December 28, 2020, a second stimulus bill was enacted which enhanced the CARES Act by, among other changes, extending the employee retention credit, extending the work opportunity credit, and allowing for 100% deduction for certain business meals through the year 2022.\nAdditional guidance may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, the Department of the Treasury, or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\nWe continue to monitor changes and proposed changes to tax and other laws that may impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition and liquidity. It is currently unclear how the agenda of the new administration will impact our business. It is also uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the CARES Act. As a result, we may not be able to utilize our existing net operating losses or any portion thereof in the current tax year or any available carryforward period.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in April 2013 through December 31, 2020, our common stock close price has ranged from $7.46 to $38.92. In addition to the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the market prices of stocks generally, or those of amusement and theme parks companies;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in business or regulatory conditions;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nrepurchases of our common stock;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry, particularly with respect to strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to litigation;\n\u2022\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional or activist stockholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from pandemics, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events.\nWe cannot guarantee that our allocation of capital to various alternatives will enhance long-term stockholder value, and in some cases, our Share Repurchase Program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nOur goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. This includes spending on capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. There can be no assurance that our capital allocation decisions will enhance stockholder value. Our Board has previously authorized a share repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our common stock (the \u201cShare Repurchase Program\u201d), of which approximately $237.6 million remains available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2020. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on our trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. In connection with Amendment No. 12 to our Amended Credit Agreement, we are restricted from paying any dividends or making restricted payments, including share repurchases, through the third quarter of 2022 unless certain conditions are met.\nDuring 2020, prior to the COVID-19 temporary park closures, we completed a share repurchase of 469,785 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $12.4 million. Repurchases of our common stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of the Share Repurchase Program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although the Share Repurchase Program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce such program\u2019s effectiveness.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nShares held by Hill Path and certain of our directors, officers and employees are eligible for resale, subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144. In addition, pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the HP Purchase, we granted Hill Path the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of common stock under the Securities Act.\nIf Hill Path exercises their registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly. This factor could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities.\nIn addition, the shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to provisions relating to various vesting agreements, any applicable lock-up agreements in effect from time to time and Rule 144, as applicable. A total of 15,000,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, of which approximately 7,680,000 shares of common stock remain available for future issuance as of December 31, 2020. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you.\nOur indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future.\nWe have not paid a dividend since September 2016. Dividends, if any, and the timing of declaration of any such dividends, will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that the Board deems relevant. Our ability to declare dividends and make other restricted payments is limited by covenants in our senior secured credit facilities pursuant to a credit agreement dated as of December 1, 2009, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time (the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d). In connection with Amendment No. 12 to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we are restricted from paying any dividends or making restricted payments, including share repurchases, through the third quarter of 2022 unless certain conditions are met. See Note 11-Long-Term Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.\nThese provisions provide for, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;\n\u2022\ncertain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe removal of directors with or without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66.67% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; and\n\u2022\nthat certain provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66.67% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nThe concentration of ownership of our capital stock limits your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned (as determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC) approximately 62.4% of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Also, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders.\nNon-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of our common stock.\nWe believe that we are currently a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. So long as our common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, a non-U.S. stockholder who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder\u2019s holding period) more than 5% of our common stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13860, "SIC": 7996, "TIC": "SEAS"}
