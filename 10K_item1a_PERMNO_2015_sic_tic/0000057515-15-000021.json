{"cik": "57515", "company": "LANCASTER COLONY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to certain risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf any of the following risks occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly.\nIncreases in the costs or limitations to the availability of raw materials we use to produce our products could adversely affect our business by increasing our costs to produce goods.\nOur principal raw-material needs include soybean oil, various sweeteners, eggs, dairy-related products, flour, various films, plastic and paper packaging materials and water. Our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes or other events. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, worldwide demand, livestock disease (for example, avian influenza), crop disease and/or crop pests.\nWe purchase a majority of our key raw materials on the open market. Our ability to avoid the adverse effects of a pronounced, sustained price increase in our raw materials is limited. We have observed increased volatility in the costs of many of these raw materials in recent years. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we experienced a significant increase in our egg-based ingredient costs as a direct result of a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza that affected the primary egg-producing region in the United States. This increase was very sudden and significant and it adversely affected our results for the quarter. In 2011 and 2012, commodity markets for grain-based products on which our food products depend, including dairy, soybean oil and flour products, rose significantly and were unusually volatile due to market concerns over weather, disease, grain-based fuel sources and worldwide demand. Further, fluctuating petroleum prices have impacted our costs of resin-based packaging and our costs of inbound freight on all purchased materials.\nWe try to limit our exposure to price fluctuations for raw materials by periodically entering into longer-term, fixed-price contracts for certain raw materials, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in limiting our exposure to these price fluctuations. We may experience further increases in the costs of raw materials, and we may try to offset such cost increases with higher prices or other measures. However, we may be unable to successfully implement offsetting measures. Such further cost increases, as well as an inability to effectively implement additional measures to offset higher costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nMcLane, a foodservice distributor, is our largest customer and an adverse change in the financial condition of its business could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the loss of, or a significant reduction in, our business with the underlying foodservice customers could cause our sales and net income to decrease.\nOur net sales to McLane represented 18% of consolidated net sales for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our accounts receivable balance from McLane as of June 30, 2015 was $8.7 million. McLane is a large national distributor that sells and distributes our products to several of our foodservice national chain customers, principally in the quick service and casual dining channels. In general, our foodservice national chain customers have direct relationships with us, but many choose to buy our products through McLane, who acts as their distributor. McLane orders our products on behalf of these customers and we invoice McLane for these sales. Thus, unfavorable changes in the financial condition of McLane, or the loss of, or a significant reduction in, our business with McLane, could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. In addition, the loss of, or significant reduction in our business with the underlying foodservice customers, or other disruptions, such as decreased consumer demand or stronger competition, could also have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We believe that our relationship with McLane and the underlying foodservice customers is good, but we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain these relationships. McLane and the underlying foodservice customers are not typically committed to long-term contractual obligations with us, and they may switch to other suppliers that offer lower prices, differentiated products or customer service that McLane and/or the underlying foodservice customers perceive to be more favorable. In addition, changes in the general business model of McLane, or the underlying foodservice customers, could affect the profitability.\nWal-Mart is our second largest customer and an adverse change in the financial condition of its business could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the loss of, or a significant reduction in, its business could cause our sales and net income to decrease.\nOur net sales to Wal-Mart represented 16% of consolidated net sales for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our accounts receivable balance from Wal-Mart as of June 30, 2015 was $16.4 million. While our relationship with Wal-Mart has been long-standing and believed to be good, we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain this relationship. Wal-Mart is not contractually obligated to purchase from us. In addition, changes in Wal-Mart\u2019s general business model, such as reducing the branded products we market, or devoting more shelf space to private label products, could adversely affect the profitability of our business with Wal-Mart, even if we maintain a good relationship. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, this business could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. Unfavorable changes in Wal-Mart\u2019s financial condition or other disruptions to Wal-Mart, such as decreased consumer demand or stronger competition, could also have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCompetitive conditions within our markets could impact our sales volumes and operating margins.\nCompetition within all of our markets is intense and is expected to remain so. Numerous competitors exist, many of which are larger than us in size. These competitive conditions could lead to significant downward pressure on the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nCompetitive considerations in the various product categories in which we sell are numerous and include price, product innovation, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences and trends. In order to protect existing market share or capture increased market share among our retail and foodservice channels, we may decide to increase our spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation. The success of marketing, advertising and new product innovation is subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. As a result, any increased expenditures we make may not maintain or enhance market share and could result in lower profitability.\nWe may be subject to product recalls or other claims for mislabeled, adulterated, contaminated or spoiled food products.\nOur results of operations could be impacted by both real and unfounded claims regarding our products, our competitors\u2019 products and our suppliers\u2019 products. Under adverse circumstances, we may need to recall some of our products if they are, or have the potential to be, mislabeled, adulterated or contaminated. Any of these circumstances could necessitate a voluntary or mandatory recall due to a substantial product hazard, a need to change a product\u2019s labeling or out of an abundance of caution for consumer safety. A pervasive product recall may have an adverse effect on our results of operations due to the costs of a recall, related legal claims, the destruction of product inventory, lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time, or a loss of customer and consumer sentiment. In addition, we may also be liable if any of our products causes bodily injury.\nAny claim or product recall could stem from, or result in, noncompliance with federal or state food laws and regulations. Such an action could force us to stop selling our products and create significant adverse publicity that could harm our credibility and decrease market acceptance of our products.\nIf we are required to defend against a product liability or other claim, whether or not we are found liable under the claim, we could incur substantial costs, our reputation could suffer and our customers might substantially reduce their existing or future orders from us.\nAdverse publicity or consumer concern regarding the safety and quality of food products or health concerns, whether with our products or for food products in the same food group as our products, may result in the loss of sales.\nWe are highly dependent upon consumers\u2019 perception of the safety, quality and possible dietary attributes of our products. As a result, substantial negative publicity concerning one or more of our products, or other foods similar to or in the same food group as our products, could lead to a loss of consumer confidence in our products, removal of our products from retailers\u2019 shelves and/or reduced prices and sales of our products. Product quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could hurt the image of our brands and cause consumers to choose other products. Furthermore, any product recall, whether our own or by a third party within one of our categories or due to real or unfounded allegations, could damage our brand image and reputation. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we conduct operations in a market channel that suffers a loss in consumer confidence as to the safety and quality of food products, our business could be materially affected. The food industry has recently been subject to negative publicity concerning the health implications of GMOs, obesity, trans fat, diacetyl, artificial growth hormones, and bacterial contamination, such as salmonella and listeria. Consumers may increasingly require that foods meet stricter standards than are required by applicable governmental agencies, thereby increasing the cost of manufacturing such foods and ingredients. Developments in any of these areas, including, but not limited to, a negative perception about our formulations could cause our operating results to differ materially from expected results. Any of these events could materially reduce our sales, materially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on the value of the brands we sell, and the failure to maintain and enhance these brands could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names. Maintaining and enhancing our brand image and recognition is essential to our long-term success and maintaining license agreements under which we market and sell certain brands is important to our business. The failure to do either could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We seek to maintain and enhance our brands through a variety of efforts, including the delivery of quality products, extending our brands into new markets and new products and investing in marketing and advertising. The costs of maintaining and enhancing our brands, including maintaining our rights to brands under license agreements, may increase, and these increased costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe manufacture and sell numerous products pursuant to brand license agreements, including without limitation Olive Garden\u00ae dressing, Jack Daniel's\u00ae mustards, Hungry Girl\u00ae flatbreads and Ortalli\u00ae balsamic vinegar. We believe that our relationships with our brand licensors are good, but we cannot assure that we will maintain those relationships. Many of our brand license agreements can be terminated or not renewed at the option of the licensor upon short notice to us. The termination of our brand license agreements, the failure to renew our brand license agreements on terms favorable to us, or the impairment of our relationship with our brand licensors could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability and results of operations.\nIn addition, we increasingly rely on electronic marketing, such as social media platforms and the use of online marketing strategies, to support and enhance our brands. This marketplace is growing and evolving quickly and allows for the rapid dissemination of information regarding our brands by us and consumers. We may not be able to successfully adapt our marketing efforts to this marketplace, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, negative opinions or commentary posted online regarding our brands, regardless of their underlying merits or accuracy, could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the performance of major retailers, wholesalers, food brokers, distributors, foodservice customers and mass merchants for the success of our business, and should they perform poorly or give higher priority to other brands or products, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe sell our products principally to retail outlets and foodservice customers, including traditional supermarkets, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, specialty food distributors, foodservice distributors and national restaurant chain accounts. The replacement by or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or chains, or our foodservice customers, or our inability to collect accounts receivable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, many of our retail customers offer branded and private label products that compete directly with our products for shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that these customers may give higher priority or promotional support to their own products or to the products of our competitors or discontinue the use of our products in favor of their own products or other competing products. Failure to maintain our retail shelf space or priority with these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIncreases in energy-related costs could negatively affect our business by increasing our costs to produce goods.\nWe are subject to volatility in energy-related costs that affect the cost of producing and distributing our products, including our petroleum-derived packaging materials. Increases in these types of costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nManufacturing capacity constraints may have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur current manufacturing facilities may be inadequate to meet significantly increased demand for some of our food products. Our ability to increase our manufacturing capacity depends on many factors, including the availability of capital, steadily increasing consumer demand, tool delivery, construction lead-times, installation, qualification, regulatory permitting and regulatory requirements.\nA lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand could cause our product quality and/or customer service levels to decrease, which may negatively affect customer demand for our products and customer relations generally, and which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, operating our facilities at or near capacity may also increase our production and distribution costs and negatively affect relations with our employees, which could result in higher employee turnover, labor disputes, and disruptions in our operations.\nA disruption of production at certain manufacturing facilities could result in an inability to provide adequate levels of customer service.\nBecause we source certain products from single manufacturing sites, it is possible that we could experience a production disruption that results in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products. Should we not be able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner, or on favorable terms, a negative impact on our operations could result, including the potential for long-term loss of product placement with various customers.\nThe availability and cost of transportation for our products is vital to our success, and the loss of availability or increase in the cost of transportation could have an unfavorable impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to obtain adequate and reasonably priced methods of transportation to distribute our products is a key factor to our success. A substantial portion of our products requires the use of refrigerated trailers for shipping. Delays in transportation, including weather-related delays, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, increased line haul costs due to industry capacity constraints and high fuel costs could also negatively impact our financial results. We are often required to pay fuel surcharges that fluctuate with the price of diesel fuel to third-party transporters of our products. These fuel surcharges can be substantial and would increase our cost of goods sold. If we were unable to pass those higher costs to our customers in the form of price increases, those higher costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur inability to successfully renegotiate collective bargaining contracts and any prolonged work stoppages or other business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe believe that our labor relations with employees under collective bargaining contracts are satisfactory, but our inability to negotiate the renewal of these contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any prolonged work stoppages could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our next labor contract negotiation relates to our Bedford Heights, Ohio plant facility, which produces various garlic bread products. The expiration date of this labor contract is April 30, 2016.\nWe are also subject to risks of other business disruptions associated with our dependence on our production facilities and our distribution systems. Natural disasters, terrorist activity or other unforeseen events could interrupt our production or distribution and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including the potential for long-term loss of product placement with our customers.\nTechnology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.\nWe increasingly rely on information technology systems to conduct and manage our business operations, including the processing, transmitting, and storing of electronic information. For example, our sales group and our production and distribution facilities utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between our personnel, customers, and suppliers depends on information technology. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures and other security issues. If we are unable to adequately protect against these vulnerabilities, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information.\nCyber attacks or other breaches of network or other information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business.\nCyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failures or disruptions to our operations. Our inability to operate our networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses. Cyber attacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. To date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition. While we believe we take reasonable steps to protect the security of our information relative to our perceived risks, our preventative actions may be insufficient to defend against a major cyber attack in the future. The costs associated with a major cyber attack could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures, lost revenues from business interruption, litigation, regulatory fines and penalties and damage to our reputation. If we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data, sensitive information about the Company and intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer, consumer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or information technology security, it would result in damage to our reputation and brand image, which could adversely impact our employee, customer and investor relations. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to Federal, state and local government regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business operations are subject to regulation by various Federal, state and local government entities and agencies. As a producer of food products for human consumption, our operations are subject to stringent production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution standards, including regulations promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act. We cannot predict whether future regulation by various Federal, state and local governmental entities and agencies would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, our business operations and the past and present ownership and operation of our properties, including idle properties, are subject to extensive and changing Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Although most of our properties have been subjected to periodic environmental assessments, these assessments may be limited in scope and may not include or identify all potential environmental liabilities or risks associated with any particular property. We cannot be certain that our environmental assessments have identified all potential environmental liabilities or that we will not incur material environmental liabilities in the future.\nWe cannot assure that environmental issues relating to presently known matters or identified sites or to other matters or sites will not require additional, currently unanticipated investigation, assessment or expenditures. If we do incur or discover any material environmental liabilities or potential environmental liabilities in the future, we may face significant remediation costs and find it difficult to sell or lease any affected properties.\nIncreased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us. We use significant amounts of water, natural gas, diesel fuel, and electricity in the manufacture and distribution of our products. Legislation or regulations affecting these inputs could affect our profitability. In addition, climate change legislation or regulations could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned expenditures.\nWe may incur liabilities related to multiemployer pension plans which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe contribute to two multiemployer pension plans under certain collective bargaining contracts that provide pension benefits to employees and retired employees who are part of the plan. Generally, as a contributor, we are responsible for making periodic contributions to these plans. Our required contributions to these plans could increase, however, based upon a number of factors, including our ability to renegotiate collective bargaining contracts successfully, current and future regulatory requirements, the performance of the pension plan\u2019s investments, the number of participants who are entitled to receive benefits from the plan, a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates and other funding deficiencies. An increase in our required contributions to these plans could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, if we choose to voluntarily withdraw from a plan, we would be responsible for our proportionate share of the plan\u2019s underfunded vested liability. We currently estimate that our liability for a complete withdrawal from both plans could exceed $14 million. However, that amount can vary at any given time based upon a number of factors, including current and future regulatory requirements, the performance of the pension plan\u2019s investments, the number of participants who are entitled to receive benefits from the plan, the number of other contributors who participate in or withdraw from the plan and whether the plan is terminated. These factors may cause our withdrawal liability to increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe may not be able to successfully consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures and integrating acquired businesses may present financial, managerial and operational challenges.\nWe continually evaluate acquiring other businesses that would strategically fit within our operations. If we are unable to consummate, successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue growth, synergies and cost savings, including without limitation with respect to our March 2015 acquisition of Flatout, our financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, we may, from time to time, divest businesses, product lines or other operations that are less of a strategic fit within our portfolio or do not meet our growth or profitability targets. As a result, our profitability may be impacted by either gains or losses on the sales of divested assets or lost operating income or cash flows from those businesses.\nWe may incur asset impairment or restructuring charges related to acquired or divested assets, which may reduce our profitability and cash flows. Finally, a buyer\u2019s inability to fulfill contractual obligations that were assigned as part of a divestiture, including those relating to customer contracts, could lead to future financial loss on our part. These potential acquisitions or divestitures present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from ongoing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, increased expenses, assumption of unknown liabilities, indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers.\nA future increase in our indebtedness could adversely affect our profitability and operational flexibility.\nAlthough we did not have any outstanding debt as of June 30, 2015, we may incur indebtedness for a variety of reasons, including acquisitions or potential changes in capitalization that might require significant cash expenditures. A consequence of such indebtedness could be a reduction in the level of our profitability due to higher interest expense. Depending on the future extent and availability of our borrowings, we could also become more vulnerable to economic downturns, require a reduction in or curtailment of cash dividends or share repurchases, reduce or delay beneficial expansion or investment plans, or otherwise be unable to meet our obligations when due. For more information regarding our debt, see the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRestructuring and impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe did not record any restructuring and impairment charges for the three-year period ended June 30, 2015. However, future events may occur that could adversely affect the reported value of our assets and require impairment charges. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, or a material adverse change in our relationship with significant customers.\nThe loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations and prospects depend in large part on the performance of our senior management team, several of which are long-serving employees with significant knowledge of our business model and operations. Should we not be able to find qualified replacements for any of these individuals if their services were no longer available, our ability to manage our operations or successfully execute our business strategy may be materially and adversely affected.\nMr. Gerlach, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, has a significant ownership interest in our Company.\nAs of June 30, 2015, Mr. Gerlach owned or controlled 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Gerlach has significant influence on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, including the election of directors. Mr. Gerlach\u2019s voting power also may have the effect of discouraging transactions involving an actual or a potential change of control of our Company, regardless of whether a premium is offered over then-current market prices.\nThe interests of Mr. Gerlach may conflict with the interests of other holders of our common stock. This conflict of interest may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nCertain provisions of our charter documents, including provisions limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice and provisions classifying our Board of Directors, may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or influence our Board of Directors. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes of control or management, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nAdditionally, Ohio corporate law contains certain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. The Ohio Control Share Acquisition Act found in Chapter 1701 of the Ohio Revised Code provides that certain notice and informational filings and a special shareholder meeting and voting procedures must be followed prior to consummation of a proposed \u201ccontrol share acquisition,\u201d as defined in the Ohio Revised Code. Assuming compliance with the prescribed notice and information filings, a proposed control share acquisition may be accomplished only if, at a special meeting of shareholders, the acquisition is approved by both a majority of the voting power represented at the meeting and a majority of the voting power remaining after excluding the combined voting power of the \u201cinterested shares,\u201d as defined in the Ohio Revised Code. The Interested Shareholder Transactions Act found in Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code generally prohibits certain transactions, including mergers, majority share acquisitions and certain other control transactions, with an \u201cinterested shareholder,\u201d as defined in the Ohio Revised Code, for a three-year period after becoming an interested shareholder, unless our Board of Directors approved the initial acquisition. After the three-year waiting period, such a transaction may require additional approvals under this Act, including approval by two-thirds of our voting shares and a majority of our voting shares not owned by the interested shareholder. The application of these provisions of the Ohio Revised Code, or any similar anti-takeover law adopted in Ohio, could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nAlso, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,150,000 shares of Class B Voting Preferred Stock and 1,150,000 shares of Class C Nonvoting Preferred Stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any Class B Voting Preferred Stock and Class C Nonvoting Preferred Stock that may be issued in the future. The Company could use these rights to put in place a shareholder rights plan, or \u201cpoison pill,\u201d that could be used in connection with a bid or proposal of acquisition for an inadequate price.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital in the future.\nWe may need financing in the future to conduct our operations, expand our business, or refinance future indebtedness. Disruptions in global financial markets and banking systems may make credit and capital markets more difficult for companies to access, even for some companies with established revolving or other credit facilities. Any sustained weakness in the general economic conditions and/or financial markets in the U.S. or globally could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all.\nFrom time to time, we may rely on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate purposes. Our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments. The obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others.\nLong-term volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation of financial institutions, reduced alternatives, or failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity that may be needed for our businesses in the longer term. Such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities. Continuation of these disruptions could increase interest rates and the cost of capital and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.", "PERMNO": 48523, "SIC": 2030, "TIC": "LANC"}
