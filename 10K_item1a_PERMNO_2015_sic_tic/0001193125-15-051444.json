{"cik": "1512138", "company": "Great Basin Scientific, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before you invest in our securities, you should give careful consideration to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this annual report, including our financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to invest in our securities. The occurrence of any of the adverse developments described in the following risk factors could materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a limited commercial history upon which to base our prospects, have not generated profits and do not expect to generate profits for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or sustain profitability. We began operations in January 2005, and we have a limited operating history. We have not earned significant revenue to date and do not expect to earn significant revenue in the near future. We had a net loss of $21.7 million and $9.6 million in the twelve month period ending December 31, 2014 and the twelve month period ending December 31, 2013, respectively. Our accumulated deficit was $64.0 million and $42.3 million as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by a new enterprise, many of which are beyond our control, including substantial risks and expenses in the course of developing new diagnostic tests, establishing or entering new markets, organizing operations and marketing procedures. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of these risks, expenses, complications and delays, and the competitive environment in which we operate. There is, therefore, nothing at this time upon which to base an assumption that our business plan will prove successful, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue, raise additional capital or operate profitably. We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early commercial stage companies, including scaling up our infrastructure and headcount, and may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties or delays in connection with our growth. In addition, as a result of the start-up nature of our business, we can be expected to continue to sustain substantial operating expenses without generating sufficient revenues to cover expenditures. As discussed in Note 3 to the audited financial statements and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, our recurring operating losses from operations and our need for additional sources of capital to fund our ongoing operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Any investment in our company is therefore highly speculative and could result in the loss of your entire investment.\nWe will need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and which may cause dilution to stockholders, restrict our operations or adversely affect our ability to operate our business. As of December 31, 2014, our cash balance was $2.0 million and our working capital deficit was $0.3 million. At our current burn rate of approximately $1 million a month, we estimate that our existing capital resources will fund our operations for two months or through the end of February 2015. Accordingly, we will need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or through other means in order to sustain our operations and current business strategy. We may be unable to obtain adequate financing on favorable terms, or at all, and any additional financings could result in additional dilution to our then existing stockholders or restrict our operations or adversely affect our ability to operate our business. If we are unable to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms, we may not be able to implement our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to meet our business objectives, our equity value may decrease and investors may lose some or all of their investment. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then stockholders will be reduced. If we raise funds by issuing debt, the ability of our stockholders to receive earnings or distributions may be adversely affected and we may be subject to additional covenants and restrictions.\nOur near-term success is dependent upon our ability to expand our customer base. Our current customer base is composed of hospitals and testing laboratories that use our C. diff assay. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to expand our customer base. Attracting new customers requires substantial time and expense. Any failure to expand our existing customer base would adversely affect our operating results. Many factors could affect the market acceptance and commercial success of our diagnostic assays, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to convince our potential customers of the advantages and economic value of our analyzers and assays over competing technologies and diagnostic assays;\n\u2022\nthe breadth of our assay menu relative to competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges to policies, procedures or currently accepted best practices in clinical diagnostics;\n\u2022\nthe extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture analyzers for use by potential customers during the sales evaluation phase; and\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture our commercial diagnostic cartridges and meet demand in a timely fashion.\nIf we cannot successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize new diagnostic assays, our financial results will be harmed and our ability to compete will be harmed. Our financial performance depends in part upon our ability to successfully develop and market new assays in a rapidly changing technological and economic environment. If we fail to successfully introduce new assays, we could lose customers and market share. We could also lose market share if our competitors introduce new assays or technologies that render our assays less competitive or obsolete. In addition, delays in the introduction of new assays due to regulatory, developmental or other obstacles could negatively impact our revenue and market share, as well as our earnings. Factors that can influence our ability to introduce new assays, the timing associated with new product approvals and commercial success of these assays include:\n\u2022\nthe scope of and progress made in our research and development activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully initiate and complete clinical trial studies;\n\u2022\ntimely expansion of our menu of assays;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials needed to support any regulatory approvals of our assays;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain requisite FDA or other regulatory clearances or approvals for our assays under development on a timely basis;\n\u2022\ndemand for the new assays we introduce;\n\u2022\nproduct offerings from our competitors; and\n\u2022\nthe functionality of new assays that address market requirements and customer demands.\nWe are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. Our C. diff assay and any assays that we develop and commercialize in the future are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign agencies. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our assays. In the clinical market, our assays are regulated by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries. In particular, FDA regulations govern activities such as product development, product testing, product labeling, product storage, premarket clearance or approval, manufacturing, advertising, promotion, product sales, reporting of certain product failures and distribution. Our assays will require 510(k) clearance from the FDA prior to marketing. Clinical trials are required to support a 510(k) submission.\nWe may be unable to obtain marketing clearance for our additional assays, including our Group B Strep Test for which a 510(K) application is currently under review by the FDA. If such approval is obtained, it may:\n\u2022\ntake a significant amount of time;\n\u2022\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u2022\ninvolve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing;\n\u2022\ninvolve modifications, repairs, or replacements of our assays; and/or\n\u2022\nresult in limitations on the proposed uses of our assays.\nOur facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, among other things, conformance to the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation and current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, as well as applicable foreign or international standards. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations, which are recorded on FDA Form 483, regarding potential violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and related laws, warning letters, restrictions on medical device sales or other forms of enforcement.\nSince 2009, the FDA has significantly increased its oversight of companies subject to its regulations, including medical device companies, by hiring new investigators and stepping up inspections of manufacturing facilities. The FDA has recently also significantly increased the number of warning letters issued to companies. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our diagnostic tests.\nForeign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future. Penalties for a company\u2019s non-compliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company\u2019s business license and criminal sanctions. Any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us.\nOn February 27, 2013, the FDA issued a Form-483 after inspecting our manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Form-483 included 17 observations of non-compliance with FDA\u2019s requirements. The FDA\u2019s observations listed on a Form 483 do not constitute a final determination that we were in violation of any law or regulation and in response to the Form 483 we took corrective actions to address all 17 observations, including revising manufacturing and quality procedures, training personnel, and creating new manufacturing facilities, and informed the FDA that all observations had been resolved in a final update letter on February 7, 2014. We received a letter from the FDA, dated July 22, 2014 informing us that the inspection is closed. We do not anticipate the FDA to take further action or provide further notice with regard to this matter.\nOur current and potential customers in the United States and elsewhere may also be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If our competitors and potential competitors develop superior assays and technologies, our competitive position and results of operations would suffer. We face intense competition from a number of companies that offer assays in our target markets, many of which have substantially greater financial resources and larger, more established marketing, sales and service organizations than we do. The life sciences industry is characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation. We may need to develop new technologies for our existing products and assays to be competitive. One or more of our current or future competitors could render our existing products or assays under development obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances. We may also encounter other problems in the process of delivering new assays to the marketplace, such as problems related to FDA clearance or regulations, design, development or manufacturing of such assays, and as a result we may be unsuccessful in selling such assays. Our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively against current technologies, as well as to respond effectively to technological advances by developing and marketing assays that are competitive in the continually changing technological landscape.\nIf our assays do not perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our assays are based is questioned, we could experience delayed or reduced market acceptance of our assays, increased costs and damage to our reputation. Our success depends on the market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality analyzers and diagnostic cartridges. We believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors. Our reputation and the public image of our assays or technologies may be impaired if our assays fail to perform as expected or our assays are perceived as difficult to use. Despite quality control testing, defects or errors could occur in our assays or technologies.\nIn the future, if our assays experience a material defect or error, this could result in loss or delay of revenues, delayed market acceptance, product recalls, damaged reputation, diversion of development resources, legal claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could harm our business. Such defects or errors could also prompt us to amend certain warning labels or narrow the scope of the use of our assays, either of which could hinder our success in the market. Even after any underlying concerns or problems are resolved, any widespread concerns regarding our technology or any manufacturing defects or performance errors in our assays could result in lost revenue, delayed market acceptance, damaged reputation, increased service and warranty costs and claims against us.\nIf our international distributor relationships are not successful, our ability to market and sell our assays will be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected. Outside of the United States, we depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our assays in various geographic regions, and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts. Relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nagreements with distributors may terminate prematurely due to disagreements or may result in litigation between the partners;\n\u2022\nour distributors may not devote sufficient resources to the sale of assays;\n\u2022\nour distributors may be unsuccessful in marketing our assays; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to negotiate future distributor agreements on acceptable terms.\nIf we become subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials, we could incur significant cost and time to comply. Our research and development processes involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including biological hazardous materials. We are subject to foreign, federal, state and local regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of materials and waste products. We may incur significant costs complying with both existing and future environmental laws and regulations. In particular, we are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, and the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and to regulation under the\nToxic Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the United States. OSHA or the EPA may adopt additional regulations in the future that may affect our research and development programs. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be eliminated completely. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our workers\u2019 compensation insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur diagnostic cartridges have not been manufactured on a high volume scale and are subject to unforeseen scale-up risks. While we have developed a process to manufacture diagnostic test cartridges for our current volume of sales, there can be no assurance that we can manufacture our diagnostic test cartridges at a scale that is adequate for our future commercial needs. We may face significant or unforeseen difficulties in manufacturing our diagnostic cartridges, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ntechnical issues relating to manufacturing components of our diagnostic cartridges on a high volume commercial scale at reasonable cost, and in a reasonable time frame;\n\u2022\ndifficulty meeting demand or timing requirements for orders due to excessive costs or lack of capacity for part or all of an operation or process;\n\u2022\nlack of skilled labor or unexpected increases in labor costs needed to produce or maintain our analyzers or perform certain required operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations or in quality or other requirements that lead to additional manufacturing costs or an inability to supply product in a timely manner, if at all; and\n\u2022\nincreases in raw material or component supply cost or an inability to obtain supplies of certain critical supplies needed to complete our manufacturing processes.\nThese and other difficulties may only become apparent when scaling up to the manufacturing process of our diagnostic cartridges to a more substantive commercial scale. In the event our diagnostic cartridges cannot be manufactured in sufficient commercial quantities or manufacturing is delayed, our future prospects could be significantly impacted and our financial prospects would be materially harmed.\nWe or our suppliers may experience development or manufacturing problems or delays that could limit the growth of our revenue or increase our losses. We may encounter unforeseen situations in the manufacturing of our diagnostic cartridges that could result in delays or shortfalls in our production. Our suppliers may also face similar delays or shortfalls. In addition, our or our suppliers\u2019 production processes may have to change to accommodate any significant future expansion of our manufacturing capacity, which may increase our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing costs, delay production of our diagnostic cartridges, reduce our product gross margin and adversely impact our business. If we are unable to satisfy demand for our diagnostic cartridges by successfully manufacturing and shipping our diagnostic cartridges in a timely manner, our revenue could be impaired, market acceptance for our assays could be adversely affected and our customers might instead purchase our competitors\u2019 assays. In addition, developing manufacturing procedures for assays under development tests may require developing specific production processes for those assays. Developing such processes could be time consuming and any unexpected difficulty in doing so can delay the introduction of a product.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct studies of our assays under development that will be required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily. We do not have the ability to independently conduct the field trial studies or other studies that may be required to obtain FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals for our assays. Accordingly, we expect to rely on third parties, such as independent testing laboratories and hospitals, to conduct such studies. Our reliance on these third parties will reduce our control over these activities. These third-party contractors may not complete activities on schedule or conduct studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our study design. We cannot control whether they devote sufficient time, skill and resources to our studies. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control will\nnot relieve us of any applicable requirement to prepare, and ensure compliance with, various procedures required under good clinical practices. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our studies may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for additional diagnostic assays.\nProduct liability claims could adversely impact our financial condition and our earnings and impair our reputation. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. Device failures, manufacturing defects, design flaws, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to our assays could result in an unsafe condition, injury to, or death of, a patient. The occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability claims or a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our assays. Product liability claims or product recalls in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers for our assays.\nHealth care policy changes, including U.S. health care reform legislation signed in 2010, may have a material adverse effect on us. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law. The legislation imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers. This significant increase in the tax burden on our industry could have a material, negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows. Other elements of this legislation, such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms, including shared savings pilots, and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way health care is developed and delivered, and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business.\nConsolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Many health care industry companies, including health care systems, are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the health care industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for diagnostic tests. If we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry, our projected revenues would decrease and our earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows would suffer.\nOur ability to compete depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, train, integrate and retain highly qualified technical, development, sales and marketing, managerial and administrative personnel. Competition for highly skilled individuals is extremely intense and we face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel in many areas of our business. We may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Many of the companies with which we compete for hiring experienced employees have greater resources than we have. If we fail to identify, attract, train, integrate and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel, our reputation could suffer and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success also depends on the continued service and performance of our senior management team. The replacement of members of our senior management team likely would involve significant time and costs, and the loss of any these individuals may delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Changes in existing tax laws, treaties, regulations or policies or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, or the enactment or adoption of new tax laws, treaties, regulations or policies could materially impact our effective tax rate.\nIf we do not achieve, sustain or successfully manage our anticipated growth, our business and prospects will be harmed. If we are unable to obtain or sustain adequate revenue growth, our financial results could suffer. Furthermore, significant growth will place strains on our management and our operational and financial systems and processes and our operating costs may escalate even faster than planned. If we cannot effectively manage our expanding operations and our costs, we may not be able to grow effectively or we may grow at a slower pace. Additionally, if we do not successfully forecast the timing of regulatory authorization for our additional tests, marketing and subsequent demand for our diagnostic tests or manage our anticipated expenses accordingly, our operating results will be harmed.\nOur revenue, results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer. We have one large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue. Our largest customer accounted for 10.9% of our revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The loss of any significant customer or a significant reduction in the amount of product ordered by any such customer would adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOther companies or institutions have commercial assays or may develop and market novel or improved methods for infectious disease diagnostics which may make our diagnostic platform less competitive or obsolete. The market for diagnostics is large and established, and our competitors may possess significantly greater financial resources and have larger development and commercialization capabilities than we do. We may be unable to compete effectively against these competitors either because their diagnostic platforms are superior or because they may have more expertise, experience, financial resources or stronger business relationships.\nDemand for our assays depends in part on the operating budgets and hospital-acquired infection rates of our customers, a reduction in which could limit demand for our assays and adversely affect our business. In the near term, we expect that our revenue will be derived primarily from sales of our C. diff assays to hospitals. The demand for our assays will depend in part upon the prevalence of C. diff at the hospitals of these customers and impacted by other factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nglobal macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022\ntotal bed days;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment;\n\u2022\ndifferences in budgetary cycles;\n\u2022\nmarket-driven pressures to consolidate operations and reduce costs; and\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of new technologies.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to reductions and delays in expenditures by our customers. Any decrease in our customers\u2019 budgets or expenditures, or in the size, scope or frequency of operating expenditures, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nNew technologies, techniques or assays could emerge that might offer better combinations of price and performance than our current C. diff assay or future assays and analyzers. It is critical to our success that we anticipate changes in technology and customer requirements and to successfully introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new, enhanced and competitive technologies that meet the needs of current and prospective customers. If we do not successfully innovate and introduce new technology into our product lines or manage the transitions to new product offerings, our revenues, results of operations and business will be adversely impacted. Competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved diagnostic tests and as new companies enter the market with new technologies.\nWe are dependent on single source suppliers for some of the components and materials used in our assays, and supply chain interruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial performance. Our assays are manufactured by us and we obtain supplies from a limited number of suppliers. In some cases, critical components required to manufacture our assays may only be available from a sole supplier or limited number of suppliers, any of whom would be difficult to replace. The supply of any of our manufacturing materials may be interrupted because of poor vendor performance or other events outside our control, which may require us, among other things, to identify alternate vendors and result in lost sales and increased expenses. Even if the manufacturing materials that we source are available from other parties, the time and effort involved in validating the new supplies and obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals for substitutes could impede our ability to replace such components in a timely manner or at all.\nDue to our fixed overhead costs and the depreciation of our analyzers at customer sites included in cost of sales and the costs associated with our current hand-build cartridge manufacturing process we have in the past experienced substantial negative gross margins. We will need to increase our sales volumes significantly and automate our cartridge manufacturing process in order to achieve profitability. We had negative gross margins of 146.9% and 187.4% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The components of our cost of sales include cost of materials, supplies, labor for manufacturing, equipment and facility expenses associated with manufacturing. Facility expenses include allocated overhead comprised of rent, equipment depreciation and utilities. Due to our fixed overhead costs we will continue to experience negative gross margins unless and until we are able to significantly increase our sales volume. In addition, we currently hand-build our diagnostic cartridges. We are working to automate portions of our manufacturing and assembly process, which we believe will reduce our cartridge manufacturing costs. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in automating our manufacturing process, and our failure to do so will materially limit our ability to reduce our cost of sales in the future.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe expect that we will need substantial additional funding to expand our commercialization efforts for our C. diff diagnostic test and other new diagnostic tests. Molecular diagnostic development, which includes research and development, pre-clinical and human clinical trials, is a time-consuming and expensive process that takes years to complete. We expect that our expenses will increase substantially as we move new assays through human clinical trials, seek regulatory approvals, and pursue development of additional innovations. If we obtain marketing approval for the diagnostic tests that we develop, license, or acquire, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to regulatory compliance requirements, sales and marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $21.7 million and $9.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $64.0 million. As discussed in Note 3 to the audited financial statements and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, our recurring operating losses from operations and our need for additional sources of capital to fund our ongoing operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase as we continue our development and commercialization of our platform and seek regulatory approval for additional assays. Accordingly, our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or that such financing, if available, will be available on favorable terms. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nWe expect that we will need additional funding to manufacturer analyzers to be used by potential customers during the sales evaluation phase. Our customers evaluate the performance of products through the use of analyzers that we manufacture and provide at no cost. Our ability to grow our customer base depends upon our ability to obtain additional financing to fund the manufacturing of analyzers to deliver to such potential customers.\nOur inability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future may cause us to delay, diminish, or curtail certain operational activities, including research and development activities, clinical trials, sales and marketing, and other operations, in order to reduce costs and sustain the business, and such inability would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we work to expand our commercial activities, expand our development activities, conduct clinical trials, expand manufacturing operations and expand our infrastructure. We may need to raise additional capital to, among other things:\n\u2022\nfund clinical trials and preclinical trials for our assays under development as requested or required by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nsustain commercialization of our C. diff assays and other new assays under development;\n\u2022\nexpand and automate our manufacturing capabilities and reduce our cost of sales;\n\u2022\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts to drive market adoption and address competitive developments;\n\u2022\nfinance capital expenditures and our general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\ndevelop new assays;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nadd operational, financial and management information systems; and\n\u2022\nhire additional research and development, quality control, scientific, and general and administrative personnel.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe progress and timing of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe level of research and development investment required to maintain and improve our technology position;\n\u2022\ncost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, if any;\n\u2022\nour efforts to acquire or license complementary technologies or acquire complementary businesses;\n\u2022\nchanges in product development plans needed to address any difficulties in commercialization or changing market conditions;\n\u2022\ncompeting technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory policies or laws that may affect our operations; and\n\u2022\nchanges in physician acceptance or medical society recommendations that may affect commercial efforts.\nWe may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements. We may be unable to continue to operate without the threat of liquidation for the foreseeable future.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, and restrict our operations or require us to relinquish certain intellectual property rights. We may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances, licensing\narrangements and grants. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt and receivables financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. A failure to obtain adequate funds may cause us to curtail certain operational activities, including research and development, regulatory trials, sales and marketing, and manufacturing operations, in order to reduce costs and sustain the business, and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMarket and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price. Concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the U.S. mortgage market and a declining real estate market, unstable global credit markets and financial conditions, and volatile oil prices have led to periods of significant economic instability, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of slower global economic growth going forward, increased unemployment rates, and increased credit defaults in recent years. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturns, volatile business environments and continued unstable or unpredictable economic and market conditions. If these conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance, and share price and could require us to delay or abandon development or commercialization plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current and future service providers, manufacturers, suppliers, hospitals and other medical facilities, our third party payors, and other partners could be negatively affected by these difficult economic times, which could adversely affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget or meet our business and financial objectives.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited. As of December 31, 2014, we had federal income tax net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $51.8 million and state income tax NOL carryforwards of approximately $32.5 million. These NOL carryforwards, if not previously used, will begin to expire in 2023. We do not believe that we have experienced any previous shifts in our stock ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, that currently subject our NOL carryforwards to an annual limitation; however, future shifts in our stock ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code may subject our NOL carryforwards to an annual limitation. As a result, if we earn net taxable income in the future, the limitations on our ability to use our NOL carryforwards to reduce U.S. federal and state tax liabilities could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nWe have not performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the processes and controls to properly identify and account for transactions of a complex or non-routine nature. We are currently in the process of reviewing, documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting. We have not performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, such as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, nor have we engaged an independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of our internal control over financial reporting as of any balance sheet date or for any period reported in our financial statements.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nThe extent to which we can protect our business and technologies through intellectual property rights that we own, acquire or license is uncertain. We employ a variety of proprietary and patented technologies and methods in connection with the assays we sell or are developing. We license some of these technologies from third parties. We cannot provide any assurance that the intellectual property rights that we own or license provide effective protection from competitive threats or that we would prevail in any litigation in which our intellectual property rights are challenged. In addition, we may not be successful in obtaining new proprietary or patented technologies or methods in the future, whether through acquiring ownership or through licenses from third parties.\nOur currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot predict how long it may take for a patent to issue on any of our pending patent applications, assuming a patent does issue. Other parties may challenge patents issued or exclusively licensed to us, or courts or administrative agencies will hold our patents or the patents we license on an exclusive basis to be valid and enforceable. We may not be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and other intellectual property rights. Any third-party challenge to any of our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of some or all of the claims of such patents and could be time consuming and expensive.\nThe extent to which the patent rights of life sciences companies effectively protect their diagnostic tests and technologies is often highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the proper scope of allowable claims of patents held by life sciences companies has emerged to date in the United States. Various courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have rendered decisions that impact the scope of patentability of certain inventions or discoveries relating to diagnostic tests or genomic diagnostic testing. These decisions generally stand for the proposition that inventions that recite laws of nature are not themselves patentable unless they have sufficient additional features that provide practical assurance that the processes are genuine inventive applications of those laws rather than patent drafting efforts designed to monopolize a law of nature itself. What constitutes a \u201csufficient\u201d additional feature for this purpose is uncertain. While we do not generally rely on gene sequence patents, this evolving case law in the United States may adversely impact our ability to obtain new patents and may facilitate third-party challenges to our existing owned and exclusively licensed patents.\nWe cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in patents we own or in those to which we have exclusive license rights. For example:\n\u2022\nthe inventor(s) named in one or more of our patents or patent applications might not have been the first to have made the relevant invention;\n\u2022\nthe inventor (or his assignee) might not have been the first to file a patent application for the claimed invention;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative diagnostic tests and technologies or may successfully replicate our product and technologies;\n\u2022\nit is possible that the patents we own or in which have exclusive license rights may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties and found to be invalid or unenforceable;\n\u2022\nany patents we obtain or exclusively license may expire before, or within a limited time period after, the assays and services relating to such patents are commercialized;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop or acquire additional proprietary assays and technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022\nothers may acquire patents that could be asserted against us in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property rights. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation and switch the U.S. patent system from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system. Under a first-to-file system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, including the first-to-file provisions in particular, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned and licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents that we own or license, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nPatent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are not published until at least eighteen months after filing and it is possible for a patent application filed in the United States to be maintained in secrecy until a patent issues on the application. In addition, publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries. We therefore cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications that cover inventions that are the subject of pending applications that we own or exclusively license or that we were the first to invent the technology (if filed prior to the Leahy-Smith Act) or first to file (if filed after the Leahy-Smith Act). Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology that is similar to or the same as our technology. Any such patent application may have priority over patent applications that we own and, if a patent issues on such patent application, we could be required to obtain a license to such patent in order to carry on our business. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application covering an invention that is similar to, or the same as, an invention that we own, we may have to participate in an interference or other proceeding in the USPTO or a court to determine priority of invention in the United States, for applications and patents made prior to the enactment of the Leahy-Smith Act. For applications and patents made following the enactment of the Leahy-Smith Act, we may have to participate in a derivation proceeding to resolve disputes relating to inventorship. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in our inability to obtain or retain any U.S. patent rights with respect to such invention.\nIn addition, the laws of foreign jurisdictions may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. Publications of discoveries in scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Moreover, the USPTO might require that the term of a patent issuing from a pending patent application be disclaimed and limited to the term of another patent that is commonly owned or names a common inventor. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, term, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions patent applications related to our novel technologies and product candidates that are important to our business.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing or prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. In some circumstances, our licensors may have the right to enforce the licensed patents without our involvement or consent, or to decide not to enforce or to allow us to enforce the licensed patents. Therefore, these patents and patent applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If any of our licensors fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights that we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated and our right to develop and commercialize any of our product candidates that are the subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected.\nOur pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In particular, during prosecution of any patent application, the issuance of any patents based on the application may depend upon our ability to generate additional nonclinical or clinical data that support the patentability of our proposed claims. We may not be able to generate sufficient additional data on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings or other patent office proceedings or litigation, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission or proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights; allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us; or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our owned and licensed patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends upon compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent prosecution process and following the issuance of a patent. There are situations in which noncompliance with these requirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case if our patent were in force.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to protect our competitive position and to prevent others from manufacturing, using or selling competing assays. The scope of our owned and exclusively licensed intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to prevent others from manufacturing, using or selling competing assays. Competitors could purchase our product and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies and thereby avoid infringing our intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property is not sufficient to effectively prevent our competitors from developing and selling similar diagnostic tests, our competitive position and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur platform depends on certain technologies that are licensed to us. We do not control these technologies and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from manufacturing our assays. We rely on licenses to various proprietary technologies that are material to our business, including the development of certain future assays. We have entered into non-exclusive licenses with Biohelix, a subsidiary of Quidel Corporation and a license with Integrated DNA Technologies that has certain exclusive and non-exclusive fields. Our rights to use these technologies will be subject to the continuation of and our compliance with the terms of those licenses.\nWe may become involved in disputes relating to our intellectual property rights, and may need to resort to litigation in order to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights. Extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights has been common in the medical diagnostic testing industry. Litigation may be necessary to assert infringement claims, protect trade secrets or know-how and determine the enforceability, scope and validity of certain proprietary rights. Litigation may even be necessary to resolve disputes of inventorship or ownership of proprietary rights. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property lawsuits, USPTO interference or derivation proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings (e.g., a re-examination) in the United States and internationally involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, such proceedings are costly and time consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain.\nEven if we prevail in such a proceeding in which we assert our intellectual property rights against third parties, the remedy we obtain may not be commercially meaningful or adequately compensate us for any damages we may have suffered. If we do not prevail in such a proceeding, our patents could potentially be declared to be invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or we could otherwise lose valuable intellectual property rights. Similar proceedings involving the intellectual property we exclusively license could also have an impact on our business. Further, if any of our other owned or exclusively licensed patents are declared invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, our competitive position could be adversely affected.\nWe could face claims that our activities or the manufacture, use or sale of our assays infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could cause us to pay damages or licensing fees and limit our ability to sell some or all of our assays and services. Our research, development and commercialization activities may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents or other intellectual property rights owned by other parties of which we may be unaware because the relevant patent applications may have been filed but not yet published. Certain of our competitors and other companies have substantial patent portfolios, and may attempt to use patent litigation as a means to obtain a competitive advantage or to extract licensing revenue. In addition to patent infringement claims, we may also be subject to other claims relating to the violation of intellectual property rights, such as claims that we have misappropriated trade secrets or infringed third party trademarks. The risks of being involved in such litigation may also increase as we gain greater visibility as a public company and as we gain commercial acceptance of our diagnostic tests and move into new markets and applications for our assays.\nRegardless of merit or outcome, our involvement in any litigation, interference or other administrative proceedings could cause us to incur substantial expense and could significantly divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our share price to decline. An adverse determination, or any actions we take or agreements we enter into in order to resolve or avoid disputes, may subject us to the loss of our proprietary position or to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may include substantial cost and ongoing royalties. Licenses may not be available from third parties, or may not be obtainable on satisfactory terms. An adverse determination or a failure to obtain necessary licenses may restrict or prevent us from manufacturing and selling our diagnostic tests and offering our services. These outcomes could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property outside of the United States. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not\nfavor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to medical devices, diagnostic testing and biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents and for licensors, if they were to seek to do so, to stop infringement of patents that are licensed to us. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Additionally, prosecuting and maintaining intellectual property (particularly patent) rights are very costly endeavors, and for these and other reasons we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets. We do not know whether legal and government fees will increase substantially and therefore are unable to predict whether cost may factor into our global intellectual property strategy.\nIn addition to the risks associated with patent rights, the laws in some foreign jurisdictions may not provide protection for our trade secrets and other intellectual property. If our trade secrets or other intellectual property are misappropriated in foreign jurisdictions, we may be without adequate remedies to address these issues. Additionally, we also rely on confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements to protect our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions. These agreements may provide for contractual remedies in the event of misappropriation, but we do not know to what extent, if any, these agreements and any remedies for their breach, will be enforced by a foreign court. In the event our intellectual property is misappropriated or infringed upon and an adequate remedy is not available, our future prospects will likely diminish. The sale of diagnostic tests that infringe our intellectual property rights, particularly if such diagnostic tests are offered at a lower cost, could negatively impact our ability to achieve commercial success and may materially and adversely harm our business.\nOur failure to secure trademark registrations could adversely affect our business and our ability to market our assays and product candidates. Our trademark applications in the United States and any other jurisdictions where we may file may not be allowed for registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in corresponding foreign agencies, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our applications and/or registrations, and our applications and/or registrations may not survive such proceedings. Failure to secure such trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our business and our ability to market our diagnostic tests and product candidates.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, or the misappropriation of the intellectual property we regard as our own. We rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know how and technological advances, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Nevertheless, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, third party contractors, third party collaborators and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements generally require that the other party to the agreement keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by us or made known to the other party by us during the course of the other party\u2019s relationship with us. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to seek to pursue a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Further, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information and therefore be free to use such trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary information may be misappropriated as a result of breaches of our electronic or physical security systems in which case we may have no legal recourse. Failure to obtain, or maintain, trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary\ninformation to develop assays that compete with our diagnostic tests or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. As is common in our industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other companies in our industry or in related industries, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that we or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Owning our Common Stock and Other Securities\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, in addition to the other risks mentioned in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Form-10K, are:\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our stockholders, executives, and directors;\n\u2022\nvolatility and limitations in trading volumes of our shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter new markets;\n\u2022\nactual or un-anticipated fluctuations in our annual and quarterly financial results;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financings to continue and expand our commercial activities, expand our manufacturing operations, conduct and complete research and development activities including, but not limited to, our human clinical trials, and other business activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to secure resources and the necessary personnel to continue and expand our commercial activities, develop additional assays, conduct clinical trials and gain approval for our additional assays on our desired schedule;\n\u2022\ncommencement, enrollment or results of our clinical trials of our assays or any future clinical trials we may conduct;\n\u2022\nchanges in the development status of our assays;\n\u2022\nany delays or adverse developments or perceived adverse developments with respect to the FDA\u2019s review of our planned clinical trials;\n\u2022\nany delay in our submission for studies or test approvals or adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for our assays;\n\u2022\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements regarding new assays, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nunanticipated safety concerns related to our assays;\n\u2022\nfailures to meet external expectations or management guidance;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure or dividend policy, including as a result of future issuances of securities and sales of large blocks of common stock by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nour cash position;\n\u2022\nannouncements and events surrounding financing efforts, including debt and equity securities;\n\u2022\nour inability to enter into new markets or develop new assays;\n\u2022\nreputational issues;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing technologies and assays or new technologies and assays that may emerge;\n\u2022\nannouncements of acquisitions, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, new diagnostic tests, capital commitments, or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, political and market conditions in any of the regions in which we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in industry conditions or perceptions;\n\u2022\nchanges in valuations of similar companies or groups of companies;\n\u2022\nanalyst research reports, recommendations and changes in recommendations, price targets and withdrawals of coverage;\n\u2022\ndepartures and additions of key personnel;\n\u2022\ndisputes and litigations related to intellectual properties, proprietary rights and contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws, rules, regulations, or accounting practices and other dynamics;\n\u2022\nrelease or expiry of lockup or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding common shares;\n\u2022\nannouncements or actions taken by our principal stockholders; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which may be out of our control.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our share price to fall. We expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including expanding research and development, funding clinical trials, purchasing of capital equipment, hiring new personnel, commercializing our diagnostic tests, and continuing activities as an operating public company. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nThe low trading volume of our common stock may adversely affect the price of our shares. Although our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ, our common stock has experienced low trading volume. As of February 13, 2015, the 50 day average daily trading volume of our common stock, as reported by NASDAQ, was 12,668 shares. Limited trading volume may subject our common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for investors to sell shares of our common stock at a price that is attractive to them.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market may cause our stock price to decline and impair our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our equity securities. There are a substantial number of shares of our common stock held by stockholders who owned shares of our capital stock prior to our initial public offering that may be able to sell in the public market upon expiration of the 180-day lock-up agreements they\nsigned in connection with our initial public offering. Sales by such stockholders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe plan to register all shares of our common stock that we may issue pursuant to our 2006 Stock Option Plan, our 2014 Stock Option Plan and our Omnibus Plan. Shares issued by us upon exercise of options granted under these equity plans will be eligible for sale in the public market. If any of these holders cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock. These sales also could impede our ability to raise capital in the future.\n\u201cPenny stock\u201d rules may make buying or selling our securities difficult, which may make our stock less liquid and make it harder for investors to buy and sell our securities. If at any time in the future our shares of common stock are not listed for trading by NASDAQ and begin to trade on an over-the-counter market such as the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or any quotation system maintained by OTC Markets, Inc., trading in our securities will be subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules and it is anticipated that trading in our securities will continue to be subject to the penny stock rules for the foreseeable future. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules require that any broker-dealer who recommends our securities to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors must, prior to the sale, make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements may discourage broker-dealers from recommending transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the liquidity of our securities and consequently adversely affect the market price for our securities.\nNASDAQ may delist our common stock from its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions. Should we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, respectively, and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements.\nIf The NASDAQ Capital Market does not maintain the listing of our securities for trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022\nreduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u2022\na determination that our shares of common stock are \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u2022\ndecreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nTherefore, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell any shares or Units if they desire or need to sell them.\nFinancial reporting obligations of being a public company in the United States are expensive and time consuming, and may place significant demands on our management and other personnel. The additional obligations of being a public company in the United States require significant expenditures and may place significant demands on our management and other personnel, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements. Moreover, despite recent reforms made possible by the JOBS Act (certain provisions of which we are taking advantage of), the reporting requirements, rules, and regulations will make some activities more time-consuming and costly, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Any changes that we make to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our shares. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our share price.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transaction period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B). As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation. We may be at risk of securities class action litigation. This risk is especially relevant for us due to our dependence on positive clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals of our diagnostic tests. In the past, life science companies have experienced significant stock price volatility, particularly when associated with binary events such as clinical trials and product approvals. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and results in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nOur management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a newly formed entity. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and NASDAQ, have imposed various new requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. We expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nThe dilutive effect of our outstanding warrants could have an adverse effect on the future market price of our shares or otherwise adversely affect the interests of our stockholders. As of December 31 2014, there are 5,447,940 outstanding warrants to purchase 5,447,940 of our common shares at an average exercise price of $4.17 per share. These warrants are likely to be exercised if the market price of our shares equals or exceeds the warrant exercise price. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares will be issued, which would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. Further, if the warrants are exercised at any time in the future at a price lower than the book value per share of our common stock, existing stockholders could suffer dilution of their investment. Of these previously issued warrants, 5,045,584 warrants have a price adjustment provision, such that if the Company issues shares at a price lower than the exercise price of the warrants, the exercise price will be readjusted to match the issuance price.\nProvisions of our Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law could make an acquisition of our Company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current members of our board and management. Certain provisions of our Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, such that not all members of the Board of Directors may be elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting or by written consent of the stockholders if such action has been earlier approved by the board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least sixty percent of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in order to amend certain provisions of our Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock to amend certain provisions of our Amended and Restated bylaws.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of the voting rights on our common stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.", "PERMNO": 15010, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "GBSNQ"}
