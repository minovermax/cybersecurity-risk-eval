{"cik": "808450", "company": "NAVISTAR INTERNATIONAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control, which may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. We have in place an Enterprise Risk Management (\"ERM\") process that involves systematic risk identification and mitigation covering the categories of Strategic, Financial, Operational, and Compliance risk. The goal of ERM is not to eliminate all risk, but rather to identify and assess risks; assign, mitigate and monitor risks; and report the status of our risks to the Management Risk Committee and the Board of Directors and its committees. The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows have been and will in the future continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe face various risks related to public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics, and other outbreaks, including the deadly global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 resulted in actions taken by international, federal, state and local public health and government authorities to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans, quarantines, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, restrictions on business activities and similar requirements for individuals to restrict daily activities. These measures resulted in work stoppages at certain suppliers that are part of our supply chain, have impaired, and may continue to impair, our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. Due to supplier disruptions, we temporarily suspended operations at some facilities, including our truck and bus assembly plants in the U.S. and Mexico, as well as our engine assembly plants in the U.S. and Brazil, for various periods of time throughout the end of the second quarter. While we are considered an essential business by many state and other governments and plan to continue manufacturing operations to the extent possible, all of our scheduled production dates are subject to change based on market conditions. In the near term, it is extremely difficult or impossible to predict whether we will be forced to suspend operations again at certain plants and the duration of any such suspensions or if additional facilities will experience similar closures.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, including the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic globally, the impact on our customers and suppliers, how quickly normal economic conditions, operations and demand for our products can resume and whether any of our key markets will experience recessionary conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict with any certainty if or when any further disruptions will occur due to the rapidly changing environment as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. We believe that our future financial results will be impacted, but at this time, the magnitude of such impacts is uncertain. The temporary closure of certain plants, as well as other business disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including potential layoffs, furloughs of employees or deferral of employee compensation, may impact our ability to deliver our products to our customers on schedule. On April 13, 2020, we announced a series of cost reduction initiatives that conserved approximately $300 million in cash over the balance of our fiscal year ending October 31, 2020. Any additional cost savings initiatives or other cash actions we undertake in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, may not achieve their intended results, and may result in other adverse consequences to our business, and such impacts may be material. We currently expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our cash flow and liquidity profile. Whether we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements, capital expenditures, investments and financial obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including that we do not experience an extended shutdown of the majority of our manufacturing plants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. For example, if we cannot service all of our obligations under our existing debt, we will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional debt or equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on our financial condition at such time and the condition of the capital markets, which have and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business and operations as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or that may occur in the future.\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The extent of a global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In past recessions, demand for trucks and buses has been negatively impacted which has resulted in lower chargeouts, adverse pricing, lower parts sales and lower used truck residual values. Current economic forecasts for significant increases in unemployment in the U.S. and other regions due to the adoption of social distancing and other policies to slow the spread of COVID-19 is likely to have a negative impact on demand for our products, and these impacts could exist for an extended period of time. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, operations, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk factors\u201d section and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.\nMerger Agreement with TRATON SE'S and Other Strategic Alliances\nThere are risks and uncertainties related to TRATON SE's pending acquisition of the Company. Failure to complete the merger could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nOn January 30, 2020, we received an unsolicited proposal from TRATON SE, a Societas Europaea (\"TRATON SE\" or \"Parent\"), a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, regarding a potential transaction to acquire all the outstanding shares of Navistar that TRATON SE did not already own (the \u201cRemaining Shares\u201d) for $35.00 per share in cash. On September 10, 2020, we received a revised proposal from TRATON SE to acquire the Remaining Shares for $43.00 per share in cash. On October 16, 2020, our Board of Directors confirmed that it would be prepared to move forward with a transaction in which TRATON SE would acquire the Remaining Shares for $44.50 per share in cash. On November 7, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with TRATON SE and Dusk Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned indirect subsidiary of TRATON SE (\u201cMerger Subsidiary\u201d), pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with the Company continuing as the surviving company in the Merger as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Parent (the \u201cSurviving Corporation\u201d). The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions under the Merger Agreement could delay the completion of the Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied or waived, that the Merger will be completed, or, if consummated, that the expected benefits of the Merger will be realized.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other costs in connection with the Merger, and many of these fees and costs will be payable by us regardless of whether the Merger is consummated. Delays in the completion of the Merger, including any delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with delay and uncertainty about completion of the Merger, and could materially and adversely impact the ongoing business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price of the Company prior to the Merger and the Surviving Corporation following completion of the Merger. For instance, if the Merger is not completed, the Merger Agreement provides for certain other customary termination rights for the Company and TRATON SE, including a termination fee in the amount of $125,000,000 (the \u201cTermination Fee\u201d) that will be payable by the Company to TRATON SE in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances. Moreover, in the event that the stockholders of the Company do not approve the Merger at the Company\u2019s stockholder meeting, the Company must also reimburse TRATON SE and its affiliates for 100% of their documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses in an amount up to $25,000,000 actually incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement. If the Company is required to pay the Termination Fee and to reimburse TRATON SE for its expenses, the Termination Fee will be reduced by the amount paid as reimbursement for out-of-pocket fees and expenses of TRATON SE, such that the Company will not be required to pay an amount in excess of $125,000,000.\nAdditional information regarding the Merger and Merger Agreement can be found in Note 22, Subsequent Events, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The full text of the Merger Agreement is attached as Exhibit 2.3 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our strategic alliances and other corporate transactions, including the Merger with TRATON SE.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that our strategic alliances and other corporate transactions, including the Merger with TRATON SE, will generate all of the expected benefits, including the cost savings and strategic advantages that are anticipated from the strategic alliance with TRATON Group. In addition, we cannot assure you that disputes will not arise with our strategic alliance and other corporate transaction partners and that such disputes will not lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on the strategic alliances or our relationships with such partners. Failure to successfully manage and integrate these strategic alliances could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further restructure our business in an effort to optimize our cost structure, which could include, among other actions, additional rationalization of our strategic alliances.\nGrowth and Profitability\nWe operate in the highly competitive North American truck and parts markets, which are subject to considerable cyclicality, and to remain competitive, we must maintain profitability throughout the entire cycle.\nThe North American truck and parts markets in which we operate are highly competitive and cyclical. As a result, we and other manufacturers face competitive pricing and margin pressures that could adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain vehicle prices. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage in responding to substantial industry changes, such as changes in governmental regulations that require major additional capital expenditures. In addition, certain of our competitors may have a lower overall cost structure.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must remain profitable throughout the entire cycle. Our ability to be profitable depends in part on the varying conditions in the truck, bus, mid-range diesel engine, and service parts markets, which are subject to cycles in the overall business environment and are particularly sensitive to the industrial sector, which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled. Truck and engine demand is also dependent on general economic conditions, interest rate levels and fuel costs, among other external factors.\nIn addition, we expect that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for school buses may be impacted in the near-term as a result of actual or potential school closures. As schools reopen, it is uncertain whether school districts will have sufficient funding to purchase school buses due to funds having been diverted or depleted due to COVID-19 requirements or necessities. Furthermore, we expect that due to fewer school buses being operated, the demand for our bus parts will be adversely impacted.\nWe expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact demand for our products and sales, and our financial results, including our profitability. At this time, the full magnitude of those impacts is uncertain.\nLiquidity, Indebtedness and Debt Ratings\nOur business has significant liquidity requirements, and while recent operating results and financing activities have improved our liquidity position, the Company\u2019s overall credit profile and the cyclicality of the industry could have an adverse impact on our liquidity position.\nSignificant assumptions underlie our beliefs with respect to our liquidity position, including, among other things, assumptions relating to North American truck volumes, the continuing availability of trade credit from certain key suppliers, the ability to gain and retain market share and grow revenue and margins, the absence of material adverse developments in our competitive market position, access to the capital markets and our capital requirements and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs over the longer term. In the event that we do not have sufficient liquidity, we may be required to seek additional capital, sell assets, reduce or cut back our operating activities or otherwise alter our business strategy.\nWe currently expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our cash flow and liquidity profile. Our belief that we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements, capital expenditures, investments and financial obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including that we do not experience an extended shutdown of the majority of our manufacturing plants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. Should it become necessary, we may need to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional debt or equity capital, in order to service our existing debt or other obligations. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on our financial condition at such time and the condition of the capital markets, which have and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, cash flow, and operating flexibility.\nOur significant amount of outstanding indebtedness and the covenants contained in our debt agreements could have important consequences for our operations. The terms of certain of our agreements limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing to fund future working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, engineering and product development costs, and other general corporate requirements; however, due to recent refinancing transactions and debt agreement amendments, we have additional incremental debt financing capacity as compared to the restrictions contained in our previous debt agreements. Other consequences for our operations could include:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a portion of these funds to make significant interest payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to take advantage of business opportunities as a result of various restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt, lower interest rates and/or less restrictive debt covenants.\nOur ability to make required payments of principal and interest on our debt will depend on our future performance and the other cash requirements of our business. Our performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot provide any assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under certain of our debt agreements in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness.\nOur debt agreements contain certain restrictive covenants and customary events of default. These restrictive covenants limit our ability to take certain actions, such as, among other things: make restricted payments; incur additional debt and issue preferred or disqualified stock; create liens; create or permit to exist restrictions on our ability or the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to make certain payments or distributions; engage in sale-leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; designate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries; make certain dispositions and transfers of assets; limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to make distributions; enter into transactions with affiliates; and guarantee indebtedness. One or more of these restrictive covenants may limit our ability to execute our preferred business strategy, take advantage of business opportunities, or react to changing industry conditions.\nUpon an event of default, if not waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable, which may cause cross-defaults under our other debt obligations. If our current lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to our lenders on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt. Further, under an event of default, under our senior secured term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion, which was refinanced in November 2017 (the \"Term Loan Credit Agreement\"), our amended and restated asset-based credit agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $125 million (the \"Amended and Restated Asset-Based Credit Facility\") and the $600 million 9.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the \"Senior Secured Notes\"), the lenders for the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Credit Facility or the collateral agent for the Senior Secured Notes would have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nUpon the occurrence of a \"change of control\" as specified in each of the Company's principal debt agreements, we are required to offer to repurchase or repay such indebtedness. Under these agreements, a \"change of control\" is generally defined to include, among other things: (a) the acquisition by a person or group of at least 35 percent of our common stock, (b) a merger or consolidation in which holders of our common stock own less than a majority of the equity in the resulting entity, or (c) replacement of a majority of the members of our Board of Directors by persons who were not nominated by our current directors. Under our Amended and Restated Asset-Based Credit Facility and our Term Loan Credit Agreement, a change in control would result in an immediate event of default, which would allow our lenders to accelerate the debt owed to them. Under the indentures or loan agreements for our debt securities, we may be required to offer to purchase the outstanding notes under such indentures at a premium upon a change in control. In any such event, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay amounts outstanding under these agreements, which may also cause cross-defaults under our other debt obligations. Further, under our Amended and Restated Asset-Based Credit Facility and our Term Loan Credit Agreement, the lenders could have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. However, each of the Company's principal debt agreements and the indentures or loan agreements for our debt securities are currently structured so that an acquisition by TRATON SE does not constitute a \"change of control\" so long as certain conditions are met.\nOur indebtedness under our Term Loan Credit Agreement, Amended and Restated Asset-Based Credit Facility, NFC bank credit facility, Term Asset Backed Securitization, Variable Funding Notes (\"VFN\") and Truck Retail Accounts Corporation (\"TRAC\") credit facilities bears interest at variable interest rates that use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a benchmark rate. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the \"FCA Announcement\"). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be assured after 2023, excluding 1-week and 2-month tenors which will no longer be available after December 31, 2021, and LIBOR may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for use as a benchmark. Recent proposals for LIBOR reforms may result in the establishment of new methods of calculating LIBOR or the establishment of one or more alternative benchmark rates. As a result, this change may adversely impact the interest rate paid on some of our loans, credit facilities, other financial instruments and interest rate swaps, our interest expense may increase and our available cash flow and/or financial condition may be adversely affected.\nPast and potential downgrades in our debt ratings may adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.\nThe major debt-rating agencies routinely evaluate and rate our debt according to a number of factors, among which are our perceived financial strength and our ability to gain market share. In April 2020, Fitch downgraded our corporate rating by one level and certain of the ratings of our other debt securities by one to two levels. Additionally, S&P and Moody\u2019s changed their rating outlook in February 2020 from Stable to Positive after the initial TRATON SE non-binding proposal to purchase the Company in January 2020. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, all three rating agencies revised their outlook to Negative in April 2020. In October 2020, following the subsequent increase in the TRATON SE offer, S&P revised our outlook to CreditWatch Positive and Moody\u2019s revised our outlook to Stable. The rating agencies have noted concerns with respect to our high levels of debt but expect continued improvement in our credit metrics and cash flow generation. However, any material deterioration in our market share, warranty expense, earnings or cash flow generation could lead to a downgrade by the rating agencies in our credit ratings. Any downgrade in our credit ratings and any resulting negative publicity could adversely affect our continued access to trade credit on customary terms as well as our ability to access capital in the future under acceptable terms and conditions.\nFinancial Condition, Results of Operations and Cash Flow\nWe have significant underfunded postretirement obligations.\nOn a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") basis, the underfunded portion of our projected benefit obligation was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for pension benefits at October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $347 million and $804 million for postretirement healthcare benefits at October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In calculating these amounts, we have assumed certain mortality rates, interest rates and growth rates of retiree medical costs. The fair value of invested assets held in our postretirement benefit plans are measured at October 31 each year and are used to compute funded status. Future mortality assumption changes and growth rates of retiree medical costs actually experienced by the postretirement benefit plans, as well as reductions in interest rates, government or pharmaceutical company reimbursements, gainshare amounts from insurance companies and the investment performance of the assets, could have an adverse impact on our underfunded postretirement obligations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe continued restructuring and rationalization of our business could also accelerate our pension funding obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\"). The volatility in the financial markets affects the valuation of our pension assets and liabilities, resulting in potentially higher pension costs and higher levels of under-funding in future periods. Even though our funding requirements over the next two years would have been higher without the pension funding relief legislation, Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (\"MAP-21 Act\"), the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (\"HATFA\") and the Bi-Partisan Budget Act of 2015, as well as possible future legislative or governmental agency relief the requirements set forth in ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"IRC\"), as applicable to our U.S. pension plans (including timing requirements) mandated by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \"PPA\") to fully fund our U.S. pension plans, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur parts business may be negatively impacted by our engine strategy.\nAs a result of our decision to use third party engines in some of our products and a decline in operation of certain units due to lower market share in recent years, we are experiencing a decline in our engine-related parts business revenue. BDP supplies aftermarket parts to support the diesel engines supplied to Ford prior to December 2009. We have experienced declines in BDP\u2019s engine-related parts sales and profitability, and we expect to see further declines as diesel engines transition out of service and due to the future termination of the BDP joint venture in October 2021.\nWe could incur further restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate our portfolio of assets and identify opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our Manufacturing operations to optimize our cost structure.\nWe continue to evaluate our portfolio of assets in order to validate their strategic and financial fit. To focus on our North American Core business, we have evaluated product lines, businesses, and engineering programs that fall outside of our Core business. We assessed the strategic fit to our North American Core business and identified areas that were under-performing and/or non-strategic. For those under-performing and non-strategic areas remaining, we continually evaluate whether to fix, divest, or close those areas. In addition, we are evaluating opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our Manufacturing operations to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in restructuring and related charges including, but not limited to, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, employee termination costs, charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits, potential additional pension funding obligations, and pension curtailments, any of which could be significant, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, including goodwill, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets, which are subject to periodic impairment analysis and review. Identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results, competition, and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment.\nDeclines in profitability due to changes in volume, market pricing, cost, or the business environment could result in charges that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions to our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to the evaluation and material impairment of our long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill. During 2020, we identified triggering events in both our Truck and Global Operations segments related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we tested the long-lived assets and determined the carrying value was impaired and recognized charges of $16 million and $12 million in our Truck and Global Operations segments, respectively.\nPricing allowances and sales incentives offered to customers can be influenced by many external factors which may affect our operating results and cash flow.\nPricing allowances and sales arrangements with customers are often complex and non-standard, and may include other sales incentives, such as rebates, residual value support and financing incentives. Such pricing allowances and sales arrangements may have terms which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWarranty, Safety Standards and Emissions\nWarranty claims and related costs often have high variability and can be influenced by many external factors which may affect our operating results and cash flow.\nWarranty estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, timing, and average cost of warranty claims. However, warranty claims inherently have high variability in timing and severity and can be influenced by many external factors. As a result, actual warranty related costs may vary from the accruals for warranty related costs. We accrue warranty related costs for the trucks and engines that we manufacture under standard warranty terms and for certain claims made outside the contractual obligation period as accommodations to our customers. In addition, with respect to our optional extended warranty contracts, we recognize losses on defined pools of extended warranty contracts when the expected costs for a given pool of contracts exceeds the related unearned revenues. Over time, we have substantially reduced our engine offerings, thereby reducing our new product warranty accruals and potentially reducing the warranty exposure associated with engine specific service contracts. Although we continue to identify opportunities to refine and improve the design, efficiency and manufacturing of our products to reduce the volume and severity of warranty claims, we may incur additional charges for recalls or field campaigns to address issues which arise during this process. These charges could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may discover defects or other issues in vehicles potentially resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs.\nMeeting or exceeding many government-mandated safety standards is costly and often technologically challenging. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy defects related to motor vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that they do not comply with a safety standard or contain a safety-related defect. In addition, we may decide to take action with respect to a product issue not related to safety. Should we or government safety regulators determine that a safety standard noncompliance, safety-related defect or other product issue exists with respect to certain types of our vehicles, there could be a delay in the launch of a new model or a significant increase in warranty claims or a recall for existing models, the costs of which could be substantial. Our partnerships with other companies in engine or vehicle development can increase this risk due to the added complexity inherent in such an effort. Additionally, if we experience failure in some of our emissions components and the emission component defect rates of our engines exceed a certain level set by the California Air Resources Board (\"CARB\") or the EPA, those engines may be subject to corrective actions by such agencies, which may include extending the warranties of those engines. This could increase exposure beyond the stated warranty period to the relevant regulatory useful life of the engine which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our role as secondary engine manufacturer or as emissions certification holder for engines primarily manufactured by other companies could impair our identification of defects and increase the chance of warranty costs or recalls.\nImplementation of our emissions strategy, federal regulations and fuel economy rules may increase costs.\nRecent and future changes to on-highway emissions or performance standards (including fuel efficiency, noise, and safety), as well as compliance with additional environmental requirements, are expected to continue to add to the cost of our products and increase the engineering and product development programs of our business. Implementation of our emissions strategy is ongoing and we may experience increased costs or compliance or timing risks as we continue implementation of On Board Diagnostics (\"OBD\") systems requirements as they phase in and manage GHG emission credit balances. The EPA, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the government of Canada have issued final rules on GHG emissions and fuel economy for medium and heavy duty vehicles and engines. The emission standards establish required minimum fuel economy and GHG emissions levels for both engines and vehicles primarily through the increased use of existing technology. The rules, which apply to our engines and vehicles, initially required EPA certification for vehicles and engines to GHG emissions standards in calendar year 2014 and were fully implemented in model year 2017. EPA and NHTSA adopted a second phase of GHG emissions reductions that will apply in three emission standards beginning in model year 2021 and culminating in model year 2027.\nCalifornia has also adopted EPA emissions standards, is in the process of adopting Omnibus Low NOx regulations which would establish lower engine NOx emission standards in both 2024 and 2027 and is taking further steps to extend warranty periods and adopt stricter initial and compliance testing requirements. California is also in the process of establishing the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, a mandate requiring medium and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers to sell an increasing minimum percentage of zero emission vehicles from 2024 through 2035.\nIn November 2018, the EPA announced its intent to update the heavy-duty commercial vehicle NOx standards; however, such updates have not yet been published.\nIn addition, we are responsible for emission certification for certain partner companies which can introduce complexity into the certification process.\nThese standards will require significant investments of capital, will significantly increase costs of development for engines and vehicles, and will require us to incur administrative costs arising from implementation of the standards. These regulatory proposals under consideration or those that are proposed in the future may set standards that are difficult to achieve or adversely affect our results of operations due to increased research, development, and warranty costs.\nSupply Chain\nOur Manufacturing operations are dependent upon third-party suppliers, including, in certain cases, single-source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages.\nThird-party suppliers provide us with raw materials, parts and manufactured components (\u201cThird Party Supplies\u201d). Any delay in receiving Third Party Supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and, accordingly, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The volatility in the financial markets and uncertainty in the automotive sector could result in exposure related to the financial viability of certain of our suppliers. Suppliers may also exit certain business lines, causing us to find other suppliers for materials or components. Finding new suppliers could potentially delay our ability to timely deliver products to customers and such new suppliers may also change the terms on which they are willing to provide products to us, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many of our suppliers have unionized workforces that could be subject to work stoppages as a result of labor relations issues. The outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in work stoppages at certain suppliers that are part of our supply chain. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional work stoppages at our suppliers in the future. Due to the resulting supplier disruptions, we temporarily suspended all production at our truck and bus assembly plants in the U.S. and Mexico and our engine assembly plants in the U.S and Brazil for various periods of time throughout the end of the second quarter. All manufacturing operations at our plants are subject to change based on market conditions, component supplier disruptions, government regulations, and the continued spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. If work stoppages were to be implemented again, there could be resulting supply shortages that could impact our ability to deliver our products to our customers on schedule and, accordingly, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Some of our suppliers are the sole source for a particular supply item (e.g., the majority of engines, parts and manufactured components) and cannot be quickly or inexpensively re-sourced to another supplier due to long lead times and contractual commitments that might be required by another supplier in order to provide the component or materials. Even as production resumes by us and our suppliers, production volumes may be volatile and we may need to modify our production environment to ensure the health and safety of our workers and customers. If we are unsuccessful in managing a re-start of our production, our results of operations may be materially affected. In addition to the risks described above regarding interruption of Third Party Supplies, which are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier of a component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims or other terms relating to a component.\nHuman Capital\nOur ability to execute our strategy is dependent upon our focus on talent management.\nOur continued success depends, in large part, on our ability to identify, attract, develop, motivate and retain qualified employees in key functions and geographic areas, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Brazil. To effectively manage our domestic and global operations, we will continue engaging our workforce throughout the entire employee lifecycle to create sustained high performance for our organization. Failure to focus on all aspects of talent management could impair our ability to execute our business strategy and could have an adverse effect on our business prospects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the risk that a portion of our workforce will suffer illness or otherwise be unable to work. The COVID-19 pandemic may also result in potential layoffs, furloughs or salary reductions of employees, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel in the future.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.\nWe are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because a significant portion of our workforce is unionized. As of October 31, 2020, approximately 6,500 of our hourly workers and approximately 700 of our salaried workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Many of these agreements include provisions that limit our ability to realize cost savings from restructuring initiatives such as plant closings and reductions in workforce. In January 2019, certain of our UAW represented employees executed a new six-year master collective bargaining agreement with a ratification date of December 17, 2018 that replaced the prior agreement which expired in October 2018.\nAny strikes, threats of strikes, arbitration or other resistance in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements, or increases in costs under a newly negotiated labor agreement, could adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce structural costs and improve production efficiencies. A lengthy strike that involves a significant portion of our manufacturing facilities could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety\nOur operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing discharges to air and water; the management and disposal of hazardous substances; the cleanup of contaminated sites; and health and safety matters. We could incur material costs, including cleanup costs, civil and criminal fines, penalties and third-party claims for cost recovery, property damage or personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations. Contamination has been identified at and in the vicinity of some of our current and former properties and at properties which received wastes from current or former Company locations for which we have established financial reserves. The ultimate cost of remediating contaminated sites is difficult to accurately predict and could exceed our current estimates. In addition, as environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations have tended to become stricter, we could incur additional costs complying with requirements that are promulgated in the future. These include climate change regulation, which could increase the cost of operations through increased energy costs.\nStockholder Influence and Governance\nA small number of our stockholders have significant representation on and influence over our Board of Directors.\nIn October 2012, we entered into settlement agreements with two of our significant stockholders, Carl C. Icahn and several entities controlled by him (collectively, the \"Icahn Group\") and Mark H. Rachesky, MD, and several entities controlled by him (collectively, the \"MHR Group\") pursuant to which the Icahn Group and the MHR Group each had one representative appointed to our Board of Directors, and together the Icahn Group and the MHR Group mutually agreed upon a third representative appointed to our Board of Directors. In July 2013, we entered into amended settlement agreements with the Icahn Group and the MHR Group pursuant to which the Icahn Group and the MHR Group each had two representatives nominated for election as directors at our 2014 annual meeting, and each has continued to have two representatives nominated for election each year. On September 5, 2016, we entered into a Stockholder Agreement with TRATON Group which, among other things, provides for the appointment of two individuals designated by TRATON Group to our Board of Directors, subject to our approval, and on February 28, 2017, we appointed the two individuals designated by TRATON Group to our Board of Directors. As of October 31, 2020, based on filings made with the SEC and other information made available to us as of that date, we believe that: (i) the Icahn Group held approximately 16.7 million shares, or 16.8% of our outstanding common stock, (ii) the MHR Group held approximately 16.3 million shares, or 16.4% of our outstanding common stock, (iii) TRATON Group held approximately 16.6 million shares, or 16.7% of our outstanding common stock, and (iv) the Icahn Group, the MHR Group, TRATON Group, and two other stockholders, collectively hold approximately 66% of our outstanding common stock.\nAs a result of the foregoing, these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over the election of our Board of Directors as well as matters requiring stockholder approval. Further, this concentration of ownership may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter, by-laws, and the Merger Agreement and Delaware law could delay and discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, and applicable provisions of Delaware corporate law, may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or change our Board of Directors and management, or may prevent such an acquisition or change. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue so-called \"flexible\" preferred stock;\n\u2022\na provision for any vacancies on our Board of Directors to be filled only by the remaining directors;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or call special meetings;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally restricts us from engaging in certain business combinations with a person who acquires 15% or more of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless stockholder or Board approval is obtained prior to the acquisition\nThe foregoing provisions may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging potential investors from acquiring our stock. In addition, these provisions could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our stockholders.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement contains \"no-shop\" provisions placing certain restrictions and requirements on the ability of our Board of Directors to consider other offers to acquire the Company until the closing of the Merger or an earlier termination of the Merger Agreement.\nNOLs and Future Tax Payments\nOur ability to use net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryovers to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is a change in our ownership or a failure to generate sufficient taxable income.\nAs of October 31, 2020, we had $2.3 billion of NOL carryforwards with which to offset our future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes. Presently, there is no annual limitation on our ability to use U.S. federal NOLs to reduce future income taxes. However, we may be subject to substantial annual limitations provided by the IRC if an \"ownership change,\" as defined in Section 382 of the IRC, occurs with respect to our capital stock. Generally, an ownership change occurs if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points of our total capital stock in a three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use domestic NOLs to reduce taxable income is generally limited to an annual amount based on (i) the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate plus (ii) under certain circumstances, realized built-in gains on certain assets held prior to the ownership change for the first five years after the ownership change. Although NOLs that exceed the Section 382 limitation in any year continue to be allowed as carryforwards for the remainder of the 20-year or indefinite carryforward period and can be used to offset taxable income for years within the carryover period subject to the limitation in each year, the use of the remaining NOLs for the loss year will be prohibited if the carryover period for any loss year expires. If we should fail to generate a sufficient level of taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOL carryforward periods, then we will lose the ability to apply the NOLs as offsets to future taxable income. Similar limitations also apply to certain U.S. federal tax credits.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may not realize sufficient acceptance of our products in the marketplace in order to achieve our goal of revenue and market share growth.\nKey elements of our operating strategy are to focus on our Core markets and grow revenue and market share. The extent to which, and the rate at which, we achieve market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products is a function of many variables including, but not limited to: price, safety, efficacy, reliability, conversion costs, competitive pressures, regulatory approvals, marketing and sales efforts, operating costs, residual values, and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns. Any failure to gain and retain market share could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are involved in pending litigation, and arbitration, an adverse resolution of such matters may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows.\nLitigation and arbitration can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. The results of complex legal proceedings are often uncertain and difficult to predict. An unfavorable outcome of a particular matter described in our periodic filings or any future legal proceedings could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are currently involved in pending litigation and arbitration matters. For additional information regarding certain lawsuits in which we are involved, see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are exposed to political, economic, and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.\nWe have significant operations in foreign countries, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic, and other risks that are inherent in operating a multinational company. These risks include, among others:\n\u2022\ntrade and technology protection measures, export limitations and import and export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ntariffs imposed on key raw materials could potentially disrupt our existing supply chains and impose additional costs on our business, including costs with respect to raw materials upon which our business depends;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing international operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;\n\u2022\nmultiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations, and policies that are subject to change or which may conflict with U.S. laws, regulations and policies;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate risk;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets; and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence and spread of contagious diseases or illnesses, such as COVID-19.\nIn addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws which prohibit improper payments to foreign governments and their officials by U.S. and other business entities. Certain of the countries in which we operate present heightened corruption risks, which therefore increases the risks of our exposure under the FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and corruption laws and regulations.\nWe must comply with numerous federal security laws, procurement regulations, and procedures, as well as the rules and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business.\nWe must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts that affect how we do business with our clients and impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulations, foreign government procurement regulations and related laws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nallow our government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;\n\u2022\nallow our government clients to terminate existing contracts for the convenience of the government;\n\u2022\nrequire us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information; and\n\u2022\nrequire us to comply with laws and regulations intended to promote various social or economic goals.\nWe are subject to industrial security regulations of the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce and other federal agencies that are designed to safeguard against foreigners' access to classified or restricted information. Similarly, our international operations are subject to the rules and regulations of foreign jurisdictions.\nA failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies or procedures, including federal regulations regarding the procurement of goods and services and protection of classified information, could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, interruptions to our computer and information technology systems and sophisticated cyber-attacks.\nWe rely on our information technology systems and networks in connection with many of our business activities. Some of these networks and systems are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. As with most companies, we have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents, none of which have been material. Any future cyber incidents could, however, materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees; delay our ability to deliver products to customers; and jeopardize the security of our facilities. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders or insiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware and other cyber-attacks, are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. With some of our employees working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be increased opportunities for unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. Security breaches could also result in a violation of U.S. and international privacy and other laws and subject the Company to various litigations and proceedings. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 12503, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "NAV"}
