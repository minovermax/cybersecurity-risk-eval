{"cik": "1498021", "company": "ExamWorks Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including without limitation those described below, that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, performance and the trading price of our common stock. You should carefully consider the following risks as well as the other information included in this Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nWe may not be able to maintain or increase our profitability.\nWe may not succeed in maintaining or increasing our profitability on an annual basis or could incur quarterly or annual losses in future periods. We expect to, among other things, continue to increase our operating expenses as we grow our business. We also expect to continue to make investments in our technology infrastructure, sales and marketing, and other resources as we seek to grow, thereby incurring additional costs. If our revenue does not increase to offset these increases in costs, our operating results would be negatively affected. You should not consider our historic revenue growth rates as indicative of future growth rates.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate completed acquisitions and such acquisitions may fail to achieve the financial results we expected.\nSince July 2008, we have acquired 56 IME services businesses. These acquisitions have involved, and could continue to involve, the integration of a separate company that previously operated independently and had different systems, processes and cultures, into our existing operations. While we expect to continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions that might augment our existing services, we may be unable to successfully integrate businesses we acquire, including our recently completed acquisitions, and such acquisitions may fail to achieve the financial results we expected. Integrating completed acquisitions into our existing operations, particularly larger acquisitions, involves numerous risks, including loss of clients, diversion of our management\u2019s attention, failure to retain key personnel, and failure of the acquired business to be financially successful. In addition, we cannot be certain of the extent of any unknown or contingent liabilities of any acquired business, including liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws. We may incur material liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses. Also, depending on the location of the acquired business, we may be required to comply with laws and regulations that may differ from those of the jurisdictions in which our operations are currently conducted. Our inability to successfully integrate businesses we acquire, or if such businesses do not achieve the financial results we expect, may increase our costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in implementing our growth strategy, including acquiring companies that complement our business, which would adversely impact our growth and profitability.\nOur growth strategy is, in part, dependent on acquiring and integrating the operations of companies in the IME industry. To continue this strategic growth, we will need to continue to identify appropriate businesses to acquire and successfully undertake the acquisition of these businesses on reasonable terms. Although we expect to continue to evaluate acquisitions, we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities and implementing our growth strategy if, without limitation:\n\u25cf\nsuitable acquisition candidates are not available;\n\u25cf\nacquisitions cannot be completed on reasonable terms;\n\u25cf we inherit or assume significant liabilities relating to acquired entities or businesses, including liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws; or\n\u25cf we are unable to raise the funds necessary to make acquisitions.\nIn addition, we may compete for acquisitions with other potential acquirers, some of which may have greater financial or operational resources than we do. If we are not successful in finding attractive acquisition candidates that we can acquire on satisfactory terms, or if we cannot complete those acquisitions that we identify, we will not be able to realize the benefit of this part of our growth strategy which could harm our future profitability.\nIf we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we finance an acquisition with debt, it will result in higher leverage and interest costs. As a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, and we may increase our acquisition costs.\nThe terms of certain of our acquisitions have included, and may in the future include, earnout provisions or the issuance of indebtedness to the seller. Such earnout provisions may require us to make additional payments in cash which would reduce the amount of cash available to us or could cause us to incur additional indebtedness or cause us to issue additional shares resulting in an increase in the number of our outstanding shares. In addition, these arrangements may make it more difficult to consummate such acquisitions and can sometimes complicate integration efforts.\nOur international expansion and operations in foreign markets expose us to risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe have significant operations in select foreign markets. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. Conducting international operations subjects us to risks that could be different than those faced by us in the United States. These risks include: lack of familiarity with and unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; potentially adverse tax consequences, including foreign value added tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards; increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; and political, social, and economic instability abroad. Operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to operate and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement or may acquire new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed or are evolving. In developing and marketing new lines of business and new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. External factors, such as regulatory compliance obligations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are sensitive to regional weather conditions that may adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations are directly affected in the short-term by the weather conditions in certain of our regions of operation. Therefore our business is sensitive to the weather conditions of these regions. Unusually inclement weather, including significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain or ice, can temporarily affect our operations if clients are forced to close operational centers, and physicians and claimants are unable to travel to their appointments. Accordingly, our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter, depending on the impact of these weather conditions.\nNatural and other disasters may adversely affect our business.\nWe may be vulnerable to damage from severe weather conditions or natural disasters, including hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, power loss, communications failures and similar events, including the effects of war or acts of terrorism. If a disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be seriously or completely impaired or destroyed. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions.\nWe may need additional capital to fund our operations and finance our growth, and we may not be able to secure such capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIn order for us to grow and successfully execute our business plan, we may require additional financing which may not be available or may not be available on acceptable terms. If such financing is available, it may dilute the existing stockholders\u2019 ownership interests in the Company. Failure to obtain financing may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and may cause you to lose your entire investment in the Company. In addition, if we are unable to secure additional financing on acceptable terms or at all, it will impact our ability to consummate acquisitions.\nOur industry is regulated at the federal, state and local levels and government authorities may determine that we have failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nAs a company involved in the provision of IME services, we are subject to certain federal, state and local laws and regulations. There are significant costs involved in complying with these laws and regulations. Moreover, if we are found to have violated any applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal damages, fines, sanctions, or penalties and have our licenses revoked. If our arrangements or business practices become subject to government scrutiny or are found to violate laws or regulations, we could incur significant costs and may be required to modify certain aspects of our operations. Government audits, investigations and prosecutions, even if we ultimately are found to be without fault, can be costly and disruptive to our business and could result in the loss of clients. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations require us to comply with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions. These regulations may place restrictions on our operations, trade practices and partners and investment decisions. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and Bribery Act. Violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel and contractors with compliance with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent the company and each of our personnel and contractors from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we or they may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnintended consequences of health reform legislation in the U.S. may adversely affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry is undergoing fundamental changes resulting from political, economic and regulatory influences. In the U.S., comprehensive programs under PPACA being implemented that seek to, among other things, increase access to healthcare for the uninsured and control the escalation of healthcare expenditures within the economy. While we do not believe PPACA has had or will have a direct negative impact on our business, the legislation is still in the early stages of implementation and may have unintended consequences or indirectly impact our business. Also, in some instances our clients are health insurers that will be subject to limitations on their administrative expenses and new federal review of \u201cunreasonable\u201d rate increases which could impact the prices they are willing to pay for our services. If the legislation or related regulations cause such unintended consequences or indirect impact, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in government regulations could increase our costs of operations and/or reduce the demand for our services, which would negatively impact our growth and profitability.\nGovernmental bodies in any of the regions in which we operate may review and consider legislation that may impact our business and our industry. Secondly, state, provincial and local administrative regulatory bodies may enact new regulations or interpret existing rules and regulations in a way that impacts our business and industry. If new laws, rules or regulations are implemented or changes are made to existing laws or regulations impacting the IME industry, we may be required to incur additional costs or make changes to our services which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the confidentiality and security of patient records and the circumstances under which such information may be used or released are subject to substantial regulation by state and federal laws and regulations. The provisions of HIPAA and other regulations governing privacy, security, and electronic health data transmissions, are evolving rapidly through regulation and are often unclear and difficult to apply. If we violate HIPAA, or other applicable state, federal or local laws or regulations, we could be subject to fines and penalties. Further, final or new regulations may require costly system purchases or additional modifications to our policies and procedures, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in laws, at either the national, state, or local level, making it more difficult to bring certain kinds of cases or that limit jury awards, commonly referred to as tort reform, could decrease the demand for our services.\nChanges in laws making it more difficult to bring certain kinds of cases or that limit jury awards, commonly referred to as tort reform, could lead to a smaller number of insurance or other claims, which in turn could result in a decrease in demand for services we provide. The same is true of changes in laws that allow insurers to settle claims without the requirement of an IME in certain cases. Such a decrease in demand for our services could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain or expand our accreditation, which may adversely affect our ability to market our services.\nCertain of our subsidiaries and divisions are accredited by third-party accreditation bodies. However, we may not be able to maintain or expand our accreditation which may adversely impact our ability to competitively market our services. The costs of initial accreditation and maintenance of accreditation may exceed our expectations, and the benefits of accreditation may be outweighed by the related costs.\nIf we cannot update and maintain our information technology platform so that we can meet critical client requirements, the competitiveness of our business will suffer.\nOur information technology platform is critical to our competitive position and success. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new software solutions or enhance our existing ones in a cost-effective and timely manner and to respond to changing market conditions or client requirements, our business, results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a combination of internal development and strategic relationships to develop our infrastructure platform and software solutions. Our information technology platform is built in a Private Cloud Network. Our development and implementation of new generation software solutions and an information technology infrastructure may take longer than originally expected and require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We devote significant resources to protecting our information and updating our software and systems. Expenses associated with these steps are significant and could increase. Also, any inability to deploy our technology platform through our entire organization could cause us to operate different platforms, slow integration efforts and increase costs.\nFailures of, interruptions of, or a breach in security relating to, our information systems could adversely affect us.\nAny system failure that causes an interruption in service or availability of our information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our operations. Even though we have implemented network security measures, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, cyber-attacks, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. In addition, certain of our services are based upon the collection, distribution and protection of sensitive private data. Unauthorized users might access that data, and human error or technological failures might cause the wrongful dissemination of that data. The occurrence of any of the events described above could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems or liability under privacy laws or contracts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and if we are unable to protect them or are subject to intellectual property rights claims, our business may be harmed.\nOur intellectual property rights include certain trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, which are important assets for our business. Although we take precautions to protect our intellectual property rights, these efforts may not be sufficient or effective. In addition, various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our business. For example, we may be subject to third-party intellectual property rights claims. Regardless of the merits of the claims, any intellectual property claims could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, if any claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue any of our practices that are found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. We may also have to seek a license to continue such practices, which may significantly increase our operating expenses or may not be available to us at all. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.\nOur operations and reputation may be harmed if we do not adequately secure information.\nFederal and state laws regulate the disclosure of certain medical test results and other nonpublic medical-related personal information. If we do not adequately safeguard such information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it, our business could be impaired, our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation. In addition, any incidents with respect to the handling of such information could involve us in litigation or indemnification claims with members of our medical panel, our clients or other parties. Although we have implemented security measures to protect confidential information, our infrastructure is vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptive problems caused by our clients or others, which could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored physically at our locations or electronically in our computer systems. Such an event could damage our reputation, cause us to lose existing clients and deter potential clients, as well as expose us to liability to parties whose security or privacy has been infringed. Moreover, if we do not protect the confidentiality of private information in accordance with applicable laws, we could face significant civil or criminal sanctions. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could adversely impact our business.\nCompetition in the IME industry could result in a reduction in our revenues and earnings and adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe IME industry is highly fragmented and competitive. Our primary competitors in the IME industry include companies and individual physicians that specialize in one or more services similar to those offered by us on a local or regional basis as well as insurance companies and other organizations which have established an in-house capability of performing such services. It is also possible that our clients may establish the in-house capability of performing certain services offered by us or decide to continue to use any of our numerous small local or regional competitors to service their needs. We also compete with national, regional and local firms specializing in case management, record retrieval, document management, medical records reviews and other services we provide. It is possible that now or in the future some of our competitors could have greater financial and market resources than us. Competition from existing competitors or new entrants to our key markets could cause us to lose clients, prevent price increases for our services or could require price reductions for our services, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified physicians and other medical providers to perform IME services on our behalf, our financial condition may suffer.\nOur performance and future success depends on the talents and efforts of the physicians and other medical providers on our medical panel who perform the IME services on our behalf and on our ability to maintain good relations with those physicians and other medical providers. If we do not succeed in attracting qualified physicians and other medical providers, or retaining or motivating physicians or other medical providers, our performance may suffer and we may be unable to grow our business effectively. Further, we may be required to enhance compensation in order to recruit and retain physicians and other medical providers. As a result, our medical panel costs could increase and we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur clients may terminate their relationships with us or reduce the fees they pay us, which may have a negative impact on our business.\nOur operations depend upon our relationships with our clients. Our clients are primarily insurance companies, law firms, TPAs, government agencies and state funds. We do not have formal written agreements with many of our clients and to the extent we do, such agreements do not generally restrict our clients from terminating or deciding not to renew our contracts. If clients attempt to introduce unfavorable terms or limit the services and products we provide them, our revenues could be negatively impacted. In addition, the termination of business by any of our clients, particularly our national account clients, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to grow or retain our existing clients, particularly after acquisitions, or develop relationships with new clients, particularly national account clients.\nWe may be subject to possible litigation and legal liability, which could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nOur medical panel members make recommendations concerning the appropriateness of providers\u2019 medical treatment plans throughout the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, and we could share in potential liabilities for adverse medical consequences if the medical provider negligently provides its services or we and/or the medical provider are alleged to have inappropriately failed to certify a condition requiring care or treatment plans. We do not grant or deny claims for payment of benefits and we do not believe that we engage in the practice of medicine or the delivery of medical services. However, we may be or become subject to claims or litigation related to the grant or denial of claims for payment of benefits or allegations that we engage in the practice of medicine or the delivery of medical services. We credential our medical panel in a variety of ways, including utilizing a reputable contractor in many cases. If such credentialing is not carried out appropriately or if we do not re-credential at appropriate intervals to identify changes in licensure or other status, we may become subject to claims or litigation. Our clients might also allege that we negligently failed to detect provider fraud. Further, in performing our services, we or the medical provider may provide services that rely on the interpretation of reports or data prepared or gathered by third parties. If such information is not properly prepared or gathered, or is not accurate or complete, we may become subject to claims or litigation. In addition, we may become subject to other litigation that may adversely affect our business or results of operations. We maintain professional liability and other insurance as we believe are reasonable in light of our experience to date. However, such insurance may not be sufficient or available in the future at a reasonable cost to protect us from liability, which might adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nIf we lose our key management personnel or if we are unable to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel and other necessary employees, our business would be harmed.\nWe are dependent on our executive officers and other key personnel and those of the acquired companies, the loss of one or more of whom could materially and adversely affect us. Some of these personnel are new to the industry and some have been part of target companies for many years but may not have experience managing a larger company and integrating the separate operations of newly acquired entities. Currently, we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain talented and qualified employees as well as our executive officers. We may not be able to retain our executive officers and key employees or attract, assimilate and retain other qualified personnel in the future.\nThe terms of our indebtedness could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions.\nOur existing credit facility and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) contain, and any future indebtedness would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that may be in our best interests.\nThe credit facility and the Indenture include covenants, including requirements that:\n\u25cf\nrestrict our ability to pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to make certain investments or sell or transfer assets;\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to incur additional debt;\n\u25cf\nrestrict our ability to create certain liens; and\n\u25cf\nrestrict our ability to consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of our properties or assets.\nThe credit facility and the Indenture also include covenants which may require that we obtain consent from our lenders or noteholders with respect to acquisitions. Further, the credit facility requires that we grant security interests in newly-acquired companies; and that we do not impair our lenders\u2019 security interest in our assets.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit facility and/or the Indenture. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, our lenders or noteholders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit. In addition, if we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the credit facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. We have pledged all of our assets and personal property as collateral under the credit facility. If any of the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient funds to repay our existing debt.\nOur ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. As a result, we may not be able to comply with these covenants. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our credit facility or the Indenture, including failure as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks we face.\nWe and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our credit facility and the Indenture. If we amend the credit facility and/or the Indenture to increase the level of our indebtedness or if we enter into new facilities to incur more debt, we may be faced with additional risks and restrictions on our operations, including the following:\n\u25cf\nan increase in our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations;\n\u25cf\na requirement to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u25cf\na limit on our ability to make strategic acquisitions;\n\u25cf\na limit on our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u25cf\na limit on our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile due to a number of factors including, without limitation, those listed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and the following, many of which are beyond our control:\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf\nresults of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf\nthe failure of securities analysts to publish research about us or to make changes in their financial estimates;\n\u25cf\nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance and growth, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us, our competitors or our vendors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by third parties or governmental entities of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n\u25cf\nnew laws and governmental regulations applicable to the IME industry;\n\u25cf\na default under agreements covering our existing or future indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nchanges in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf\nfuture sales of our common stock by us, directors, executives and significant stockholders; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in economic and political conditions.\nFurthermore, from time to time the stock market experiences extreme volatility that particularly affects the market price of the stock of many smaller companies and that, in some cases, is unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Further, securities class action suits have been filed against companies following periods of market volatility in the price of their securities. If such an action is instituted against us, we may incur substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which would seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nEvolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, new SEC regulations, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and New York Stock Exchange rules are creating uncertainty for public companies. We continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nWe are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and we may be harmed.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we have significant requirements for financial reporting and internal controls. The process of maintaining and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. If we are unable to maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations on a timely basis, result in material misstatements in our financial statements and harm our operating results. In addition, we are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting every fiscal year. Each assessment includes a disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on effectiveness of our internal controls. Testing and maintaining internal controls may divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to our business. We may not be able to conclude in the future that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or our independent registered public accounting firm may not issue an unqualified report. If either we are unable to conclude in the future that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders or the possibility or perception of such future sales could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock. If our existing stockholders, including our key management personnel, sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Substantially all of the shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market.\nThe exercise of options or other equity awards or the issuance and/or payout of additional equity will result in dilution to our stockholders.\nUnder the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated 2008 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, the Company granted, and in the future intends to grant, awards of stock options to purchase common stock and other awards to our officers, directors, employees and consultants. As of February 16, 2016, approximately 3.7 million shares of our common stock were subject to issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options, approximately 1.3 million shares were subject to vesting and payout under outstanding restricted stock units, and approximately 376,000 shares were subject to vesting and payout under outstanding restricted share awards.\nOur stockholders\u2019 ownership interest will be diluted by the exercise of any of these outstanding stock options or restricted stock units.\nWe will in the future grant stock options and other awards to certain current or future officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Company under additional plans or individual agreements. The grant and exercise of these awards, as applicable, will have the effect of diluting our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests in the Company.\nFurther, we may need to raise additional funds in the future to finance our operations and/or acquire complementary businesses. If we obtain capital in future offerings, the value of the price per share of our stockholders\u2019 common stock could be reduced. In addition, if we issue additional equity securities in a future offering and certain stockholders do not participate in such offering, there will effectively be dilution in their percentage ownership interest in the Company.\nWe may also issue additional equity securities in connection with other types of transactions, including shares issued as part of the purchase price for acquisitions of assets or other companies from time to time, in connection with strategic partnerships or joint ventures, or as incentives to management or other providers of resources to the Company. Such additional issuances are likely to have the same dilutive effect.\nWe do not currently intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future and our credit facility and Indenture restrict our ability to pay such cash dividends.\nTo date, the Company has not paid any dividends on its capital stock. The Company does not anticipate making any cash dividends or other distributions to the stockholders in the immediate or foreseeable future, and any future decision to make such distributions will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company, referred to herein as the \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d or the \u201cBoard\u201d and, in any event, will be dependent upon the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Further, our existing credit facility and the Indenture restrict our ability to pay cash dividends, and any future financing agreements may also restrict our ability to pay any type of dividends. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in your shares of common stock unless you sell such shares for a price greater than that which you paid. In addition, to the extent we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if and to the extent our stock price appreciates.\nYour ability to influence corporate matters may be limited because a small number of stockholders beneficially own a substantial amount of our common stock and have substantial control over us.\nAs of February 16, 2016, our officers, directors and principal stockholders (greater than 5% stockholders) collectively beneficially own approximately 50.14% of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders may be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets, and may have interests that are different from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. In addition, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change of control, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nTransactions engaged in by our principal stockholders, our officers or directors involving our common stock may have an adverse effect on the price of our stock.\nAs described above, as of February 16, 2016, our officers, directors and principal stockholders (greater than 5% stockholders) collectively control approximately 50.14% of our common stock. Subsequent sales of our shares by these stockholders could have the effect of lowering our stock price. The perceived risk associated with the possible sale of a large number of shares by these stockholders, or the adoption of significant short positions by hedge funds or other significant investors, could cause some of our stockholders to sell their stock, thus causing the price of our stock to decline. In addition, actual or anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of stock by our directors or officers could cause other institutions or individuals to engage in short sales of our common stock, which may further cause the price of our stock to decline.\nFrom time to time our directors and executive officers may sell shares of our common stock on the open market. These sales will be publicly disclosed in filings made with the SEC. In the future, our directors and executive officers may sell a significant number of shares for a variety of reasons unrelated to the performance of our business. Our stockholders may perceive these sales as a reflection on management\u2019s view of the business and result in some stockholders selling their shares of our common stock. These sales could cause the price of our stock to drop.\nCertain provisions of our corporate governing documents and Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. Therefore, the Board of Directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for a staggered or classified board of directors consisting of three classes of directors, each serving staggered three-year terms. These rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our Company. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12330, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "EXAM"}
