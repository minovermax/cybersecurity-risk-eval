{"cik": "924095", "company": "Metavesco, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-10-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur holdings are controlled by one shareholder which owns approximately 70% of our issued and outstanding stock.\n70% of our issued and outstanding common stock is controlled by Mr. Schadel, our sole officer and director. As a result, Mr. Schadel can direct the affairs of the Company as the majority shareholder and there is no assurance that any decisions made through a shareholder vote will be the same decisions that one or more minority shareholders would make.\nThe Company has a limited operating history.\nThe Company has a limited history of operations and is in the early stage of development. As such, the Company will be subject to many risks common to such enterprises, including undercapitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial and other resources and lack of revenues. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving a return on shareholders\u2019 investment and the likelihood of success must be considered in light of its early stage of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to develop any of its projects profitably or that any of its activities will generate positive cash flow.\nThe Company\u2019s compliance and risk management programs may not be effective.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to comply with applicable laws and rules will be largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of compliance, review and reporting systems, as well as the ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. The Company cannot provide any assurance that its compliance policies and procedures will always be effective or that the Company will be successful in monitoring or evaluating its risks. In the case of alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the Company could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits, including by customers, for damages, restitution or other remedies, which could be significant. Any of these outcomes, individually or together, may among other things, materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition, investment and trading strategies, and asset value and the value of any investment in the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company may require additional funds to finance its operations.\nAdditional funds, raised through debt or equity offerings, may be needed to finance the Company\u2019s future activities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that the terms of such financing will be favorable. Failure to obtain such additional financing could cause the Company to reduce or terminate its operations.\nIf additional funds are raised through further issuances of equity or securities convertible into equity, existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities issued could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. Any debt financing secured in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for the Company to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\nMarket adoption of digital assets has been limited to date and further adoption is uncertain.\nCurrently, there is relatively small use of digital assets in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively large use by speculators, thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock. Digital assets have only recently become accepted as a means of payment for goods and services by certain major retail and commercial outlets and use of digital assets by consumers to pay such retail and commercial outlets remains limited. Conversely, a significant portion of digital asset demand is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of tokens. A lack of expansion by digital assets into the retail and commercial markets, or a contraction of such use, may result in increased volatility or a reduction in the market price of these assets. Further, if fees increase for recording transactions on these blockchains, demand for digital assets may be reduced and prevent the expansion of the networks to retail merchants and commercial businesses, resulting in a reduction in the price of these assets.\nThe value of digital assets may be subject to momentum pricing risk.\nMomentum pricing typically is associated with growth stocks and other assets whose valuation, as determined by the investing public, accounts for anticipated future appreciation in value. Market prices of digital assets are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets, and derivative platforms. Momentum pricing may have resulted, and may continue to result, in speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of digital assets, inflating and making their market prices more volatile. As a result, they may be more likely to fluctuate in value due to changing investor confidence in future appreciation (or depreciation) in their market prices, which could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s digital asset holdings and the value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nA decline in the adoption and use of digital assets could materially and adversely affect the performance of the Company.\nBecause digital assets are a relatively new asset class and a technological innovation, they are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. As a related but separate issue from that of the regulatory environment, the adoption, growth and longevity of any digital asset will require growth in its usage and in the blockchain for various applications. A lack of expansion in use of digital assets and blockchain technologies would adversely affect the financial performance of the Company. In addition, there is no assurance that any digital assets will maintain their value over the long term. Even if growth in the use of any digital assets occurs in the near or medium term, there is no assurance that such use will continue to grow over the long term. A lack of expansion of digital assets into the retail and commercial markets, may result in increased volatility or a reduction in the market price of these assets. Further, if fees increase for recording transactions on these blockchains, demand for digital assets may be reduced and prevent the expansion of the networks to retail merchants and commercial businesses, resulting in a reduction in the price of these assets. A contraction in use of any digital asset may result in increased volatility or a reduction in prices, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s investment and trading strategies, the value of its assets and the value of any investment in the Company\u2019s common stock.\nWe may invest or spend our cash in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a significant return.\nMr. Schadel, our sole officer and director and a significant stockholder, has considerable discretion in the use of our cash. Our cash may be used for purposes that do not increase our operating results or market value. Until the cash is used, it may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value. The failure of our management to invest or spend our cash effectively could result in unfavorable returns and uncertainty about our prospects, each of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur digital assets may be subject to concentration risk.\nConcentration risk is the risk of amplified losses that may occur from having a large portion of our holdings in digital assets. Digital assets returns may be highly corelated and may also be Illiquid. Investments within the same industry, geographic region or security type tend to be highly correlated, meaning that what happens to one investment is likely to happen to the others. Digital assets may also be difficult to sell off quickly. Should we need quick access to cash and are heavily invested in illiquid securities, we may not be able to tap this money in a timely or cost-efficient manner.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nCyber-attacks, data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations and trigger significant liability for us, which could harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\nAs a publicly traded company, we may experience cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. There is a risk that some or all of our cryptocurrencies could be lost or stolen as a result of one or more of these incursions. As we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats, and, despite our implementation of strict security measures and it is impossible to eliminate all such vulnerability. For instance, we may not be able to ensure the adequacy of the security measures employed by third parties, such as our service providers. Efforts to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and may not be successful. Such breaches, whether attributable to a vulnerability in our systems or otherwise, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation and materially harm our business.\nWe have not to date experienced a material cyber-event; however, the occurrence of any such event in the future could subject us to liability give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, which could damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIncorrect or fraudulent digital assets transactions may be irreversible and we could lose access to our digital assets.\nDigital asset transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the digital assets from the transaction. Because of the decentralized nature of the blockchain, once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a digital or a theft thereof generally will not be reversible, and we may not have sufficient recourse to recover our losses from any such transfer or theft. It is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, our rewards or fees could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled accounts. Though recent high profile enforcement actions against individuals laundering stolen digital assets have demonstrated some means of bringing malicious actors to justice for their theft, the stolen digital assets is likely to remain unrecoverable. Furthermore, we must possess both the unique public and private keys to our digital wallets to gain access to our digital assets and the loss of a private key required may be irreversible. Therefore, if we lose, or if a malicious actor successfully denies us access to our private keys, we may be permanently denied access to the digital assets held in the wallet corresponding to the lost, stolen or blocked keys. Though we have taken and continue to take reasonable steps to secure our private keys. if we were to lose access to our private keys or otherwise experience data loss relating to our digital wallets, we could effectively lose access to and the ability to use our digital assets. Moreover, we may be unable to secure insurance policies for our digital assets at rates or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be harmed by prolonged power and internet outages, shortages, or capacity constraints.\nOur operations require access to high-speed internet to be successful. If we lose internet access for a prolonged period, we may be required to reduce our operations or cease them altogether. If this occurs, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation and Enforcement\nRegulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of digital assets in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects, or operations.\nAs digital assets have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to digital assets; certain governments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., subject the mining, ownership and exchange of digital assets to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Ongoing and future regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nOur interactions with a blockchain may expose us to SDN or blocked persons and new legislation or regulation could adversely impact our business or the market for cryptocurrencies.\nThe Office of Financial Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its specially designated nationals (\u201cSDN\u201d) list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC\u2019s SDN list. Our Company\u2019s policy prohibits any transactions with such SDN individuals, but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we transact with respect to selling cryptocurrency assets. Moreover, the use of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, as a potential means of avoiding federally-imposed sanctions, such as those imposed in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. For example, on March 2, 2022, a group of United States Senators sent the Secretary of the United States Treasury Department a letter asking Secretary Yellen to investigate its ability to enforce such sanctions vis-\u00e0-vis Bitcoin, and on March 8, 2022, President Biden announced an executive order on cryptocurrencies which seeks to establish a unified federal regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies. We are unable to predict the nature or extent of new and proposed legislation and regulation affecting the cryptocurrency industry, or the potential impact of the use of cryptocurrencies by SDN or other blocked or sanctioned persons, which could have material adverse effects on our business and our industry more broadly. Further, we may be subject to investigation, administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties as a result of any regulatory enforcement actions, all of which could harm our reputation and affect the value of our common stock.\nDigital assets may be made illegal in certain jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business prospects and operations.\nAlthough we do not anticipate any material adverse regulations on digital assets in our jurisdictions of operation, it is possible that state or federal regulators may seek to impose harsh restrictions or total bans on digital assets which may make it impossible for us to do business. Further, although digital assets in general are largely unregulated in most countries (including the United States), regulators in certain jurisdictions may undertake new or intensify existing regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell, or use digital assets or to exchange it for traditional fiat currency such as the United States Dollar. Such restrictions may adversely affect us as the large-scale use of digital assets as a means of exchange is presently confined to certain regions globally. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of digital assets we acquire and thus harm investors.\nThe Company will have to adapt to respond to evolving security risks.\nAs technological change occurs, the security threats to the Company\u2019s digital assets will likely adapt, and previously unknown threats may emerge. The ability of the Company and Coinbase to adopt technology in response to changing security needs or trends may pose a challenge to the safekeeping of their assets. To the extent that the Company or Coinbase is unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats, The Company\u2019s assets may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s digital assets are held in Self Custody (Non-Custodial) wallets. The Company holds the majority of its digital assets in Self Custody (Non-Custodial) wallets. These wallets are used to interact with Decentralized Exchanges and other DeFi focused protocols. Mr. Schadel, our sole officer and director and our majority stockholder, is currently the holder of the private keys that provide access to these wallets.\nAdditionally, the Company from time to time holds assets at Coinbase, a SOC 1/ SOC 2 certified digital asset custodian. If Coinbase were to be subject to a malicious attack or otherwise cease its operations, the Company will be at risk of losing the majority of its digital assets. There is no assurance that Coinbase will not be subject to any such attack and there is no guarantee that Coinbase won\u2019t cease its operations.\nBanks may not provide banking services, or may cut off banking services, to businesses that provide digital asset-related services.\nA number of companies that provide digital asset-related services have been unable to find banks that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and banking services. Similarly, a number of such companies have had their existing bank accounts closed by their banks. Banks may refuse to provide bank accounts and other banking services to digital asset-related companies, or companies that accept digital assets, for a number of reasons, such as perceived compliance risks or costs. The difficulty that many businesses that provide digital asset-related services have and may continue to have in finding banks willing to provide them with bank accounts and other banking services may decrease the usefulness of digital assets as a payment system and harm public perception of digital assets. Similarly, the usefulness of digital assets as a payment system and the public perception of digital assets could be damaged if banks were to close the accounts of many or of a few key businesses providing digital asset-related services. This could decrease the market prices of digital assets, and adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s digital asset holdings and the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s business is exposed to the potential misuse of digital assets and malicious actors.\nSince the existence of digital assets, there have been attempts to use them for speculation or malicious purposes. Although lawmakers increasingly regulate the use and applications of digital assets, and software is being developed to curtail speculative and malicious activities, there can be no assurances that those measures will sufficiently deter those and other illicit activities in the future. Advances in technology, such as quantum computing, could lead to a malicious actor or botnet (a voluntary or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) being able to alter the blockchain on which digital asset transactions rely. In such circumstances, the malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, or generate new digital assets or transactions using such control. The malicious actor or botnet could double spend its own digital assets and prevent the confirmation of other users\u2019 transactions for so long as it maintains control. Such changes could adversely affect an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe security procedures and operational infrastructure of the Company and Coinbase may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of an employee of the Company or Coinbase, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Company\u2019s digital asset accounts, private keys, data or tokens. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of the Company or Coinbase to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the infrastructure of the Company or Coinbase. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, The Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of the Company\u2019s digital assets account occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of its security protocols could be harmed and the value of the Company\u2019s common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s use of proprietary and non-proprietary software, data and intellectual property may be subject to substantial risk.\nThe Company\u2019s token selection strategy may rely heavily on the use of proprietary and non-proprietary software, data and intellectual property of third parties in the digital asset sector. The reliance on this technology and data is subject to a number of important risks. For example, the operation of any element of the digital assets network, or any other electronic platform, may be severely and adversely affected by the malfunction of technology. For example, an unforeseen software or hardware malfunction could occur as a result of a virus or other outside force, or as result of a design flaw in the design and operation of the network or platform. In addition, the underlying technology of the tokens themselves, may be inactive for periods of time, known as \u201cdowntime\u201d and could have serious adverse effects on our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nNevada law contains provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, prevent attempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our stock.\nCertain provisions of Nevada law described below may make us a less attractive candidate for acquisition, which may adversely impact the value of the shares of our capital stock held by our stockholders. We have not opted out of these provisions in our Bylaws, as permitted under the Nevada Revised Statutes.\nNevada Revised Statutes Sections 78.411 through 78.444 (the \u201cNevada Combinations Statute\u201d) generally prohibit \u201ccombinations\u201d including mergers, consolidations, sales and leases of assets, issuances of securities and similar transactions by a Nevada corporation having a requisite number of stockholders of record (of which we are one) with any person who beneficially owns (or any affiliate or associate of the corporation who within the previous two years owned), directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation (an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d), within two years after such person first became an interested stockholder unless (i) the board of directors of the corporation approved the combination or transaction by which the person first became an interested stockholder before the person first became an interested stockholder or (ii) the board of directors of the corporation has approved the combination in question and, at or after that time, such combination is approved at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the target corporation, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of holders of stock representing at least 60% of the outstanding voting power of the target corporation not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder or the affiliates or associates of the interested stockholder.\nTwo years after the date the person first became an interested stockholder, the Nevada Combinations Statute prohibits any combination with that interested stockholder unless (i) the board of directors of the corporation approved the combination or transaction by which the person first became an interested stockholder before the person first became an interested stockholder or (ii) such combination is approved by a majority of the outstanding voting power of the corporation not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder. The Nevada Combinations Statute does not apply to combinations with an interested stockholder after the expiration of four years from when the person first became an interested stockholder.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of digital assets, the determination that we have made for how to account for digital assets transactions may be subject to change.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition and no official guidance has yet been provided by the FASB or the SEC, it is unclear how companies may in the future be required to account for cryptocurrency transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the necessity to change our accounting methods and restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could adversely affect the accounting for our newly mined cryptocurrency rewards and more generally negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations as well as and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expects to acquire for our own account and harm investors.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). Section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework(2013). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based on our assessment, as of June 30, 2022, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting contained material weaknesses. To remediate these material weaknesses, our management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively.\nWe believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness. However, the remediation cannot be deemed successful until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and our management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSubstantial sales of our common stock may impact the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares that we may issue upon exercise of options and warrants could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock, the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be reduced, and the price of our common stock may fall.", "PERMNO": 85756, "SIC": 6726, "TIC": "WSCC"}
