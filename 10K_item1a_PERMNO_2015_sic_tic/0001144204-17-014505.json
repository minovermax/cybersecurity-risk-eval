RISK FACTORS\nOur business, and an investment in our common stock, involves risks. The risk factors which management believes are material to our business and could negatively affect our results of operations, our financial condition and the trading value of our common stock are summarized below. Other risk factors not currently known to management, or risk factors that are currently deemed to be immaterial or unlikely, could also adversely affect our business. In assessing the following risk factors, investors should also refer to the other information contained in this Report and the Company\u2019s other filings with the SEC.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Operations\nIf our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings may be reduced.\nOur nonperforming assets may increase in future periods. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonperforming loans or real estate owned. We must establish the allowance for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable through the current period provision expenses, which are recorded as a charge to income. From time to time, we also write down the value of properties in our OREO portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are substantial collections costs, such as legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets, as well as carrying costs, such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to OREO. Further, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract management from our overall supervision of operations and other income-producing activities.\nRepayment risk associated with our adjustable rate loans may increase as interest rates rise.\nGiven the historically low interest rate environment in recent years, our adjustable rate loans have not been subject to an interest rate environment that causes them to adjust to the maximum level. As interest rates rise, such loans may involve repayment risks resulting from potentially increasing payment obligations by borrowers due to re-pricing. At December 31, 2016, there were approximately $257.8 million in adjustable rate loans, which made up 39.8% of our loan portfolio.\nInterest rate volatility could significantly reduce our profitability, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur earnings largely depend on the relationship between the yield on our earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and the cost of funds, primarily deposits and borrowings. This relationship, commonly known as the net interest margin, is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors that influence the yields and rates for, and the volume and mix of, our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nInterest rate risk can be defined as an exposure to movement in interest rates that could have an adverse impact on our net interest income. Interest rate risk arises from the imbalance in the re-pricing, maturity and/or cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities. We are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest-bearing liabilities re-price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than our interest earning assets. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nOur interest rate risk measurement and management techniques incorporate the re-pricing and cash flow attributes of our balance sheet and off-balance sheet instruments as they relate to current and potential changes in interest rates. The level of interest rate risk, measured in terms of the potential future effect on net interest income, is determined through the use of modeling and other techniques under multiple interest rate scenarios. Management\u2019s objectives are to measure, monitor and develop strategies in response to the interest rate risk profile inherent in our balance sheet.\nFuture changes in interest rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FRB maintained the federal funds rate at the historically low rate of 0.25% during 2014 and through mid-December 2015. The rate was raised to a target rate of 0.50% in December 2015 and then to a target rate of 0.75% in December 2016. It is currently unclear what the FRB intends to do in 2017. The federal funds rate has a direct correlation to general rates of interest, including our interest-bearing deposits. Our mix of asset and liabilities are considered to be sensitive to interest rate changes. Generally, customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speeds at which such prepayments occur, as well as the amount of such prepayments, are within our customers\u2019 discretion. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, our interest income will be reduced. A similar prepayment risk exists for our investment portfolio which is primarily made up of mortgage-related securities, with the added impact of accelerated recognition of premiums paid to acquire the investment security. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. On the other hand, if interest rates rise, net interest income might be reduced because interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits, increases more quickly than interest received on interest-earning assets, including loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. In addition, rising interest rates may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations because higher rates may reduce the demand for loans and the value of mortgage-related investment securities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market, including the secondary market for residential mortgage loans, could hurt our business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 88.7% of our portfolio loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. Real estate values and the real estate markets are generally affected by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, changes in economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, the availability of credit, changes in tax laws and other statutes, regulations, and policies, and acts of nature. Weakening of the real estate market could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing those loans, which in turn could adversely affect our profitability and asset quality. If we were required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, weakness in the secondary market for residential lending could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Significant disruptions in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans may limit the market for and liquidity of mortgage loans other than conforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans. The effects of potential market challenges and uncertainty, including uncertainty with respect to U.S. monetary policy, could result in price reductions in single family home values, adversely affecting the value of collateral securing mortgage loans held, any future mortgage loan originations and gains on sale of mortgage loans. Declines in real estate values and home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses or other factors could have further adverse effects on borrowers that result in higher delinquencies and charge-offs in future periods, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our number of commercial real estate, commercial business, construction and multi-family loans and consumer loans, which could increase our level of provision expense.\nOur outstanding commercial real estate, commercial business, construction and multi-family real estate loans and our manufactured home, automobile and other consumer loans, in aggregate, accounted for approximately 48.3% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016. Generally, management considers these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to first mortgage loans on one- to four-family, owner occupied residential properties.\nHistorically, these loans have had higher risks than loans secured by residential real estate for the following reasons:\n\u2022 Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Business Loans. Repayment is dependent on income being generated by the rental property or business in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service;\n\u2022 Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent on income being generated by the rental property in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service;\n\u2022 Single Family Construction Loans. Repayment is dependent upon the successful completion of the project and the ability of the contractor or builder to repay the loan from the sale of the property or obtaining permanent financing;\n\u2022 Commercial and Multi-Family Construction Loans. Repayment is dependent upon the completion of the project and income being generated by the rental property or business in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. The collateral cannot be liquidated as easily as residential real estate and may involve expensive workout techniques. It may also involve large balances of loans to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Commercial business loans may be collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, etc. which are difficult to liquidate in an event of default; and\n\u2022 Consumer Loans. Consumer loans (such as automobile and manufactured home loans) are collateralized, if at all, with assets that may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan due to depreciation, damage or loss.\nIf these non-residential loans become nonperforming, we may have to increase our provision expense which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nIf economic conditions deteriorate or the economic recovery from such deterioration remains slow over an extended period of time in our primary market areas of Northeast Florida, Central Florida and Southeast Georgia, our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely impacted as borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans declines and the value of the collateral securing the loans decreases. This geographic concentration in loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate may increase credit losses, which could increase the level of provision expense.\nOur financial results and financial condition may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, including decreases in real estate values, changes in interest rates, which may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and the Florida and Georgia state governments and other significant external events. Our market share of loans in Ware County, Georgia is significantly greater than our share of the loan market in the Jacksonville, Orlando or Tampa, Florida metropolitan areas. As a result of the concentration in Ware County, we may be more susceptible to adverse market conditions in that market. Due to the significant portion of real estate loans in the loan portfolio, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral.\nAdverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to portfolio lending during a period of rising real estate values, high sales volume activity and historically low interest rate environment. The resulting high loan-to-value ratios on a portion of our residential mortgage loan portfolio expose us to greater risk of loss.\nMuch of our portfolio lending is in one- to four-family residential properties generally located throughout Northeast Florida, Central Florida and Southeast Georgia. Because many of our portfolio loans were originated during a period of rising real estate values and historically low interest rates, based on the Company\u2019s most recent analysis, approximately 5.5% of the residential loan portfolio collateral is deficient due to a decline in real estate values since origination.\nMany of our residential mortgage loans are secured by liens on real property, and we believe some of our borrowers may have reduced equity. Residential loans with high loan-to-value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and, therefore, may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, such borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale. As a result, these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses.\nLegislative action regarding foreclosures or bankruptcy laws may negatively impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nCertain laws adopted following the financial crisis delay the initiation or completion of foreclosure proceedings on specified types of residential mortgage loans (some for a limited period of time), or otherwise limit the ability of residential loan servicers to take actions that may be essential to preserve the value of the mortgage loans. Any such limitations are likely to cause delayed or reduced collections from mortgagors and generally increased servicing costs. Any restriction on our ability to foreclose on a loan, any requirement that we forego a portion of the amount otherwise due on a loan or any requirement that we modify any original loan terms will in some instances require us to advance principal, interest, tax and insurance payments, which is likely to negatively impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe continue to hold and acquire \u201cother real estate owned,\u201d or OREO, which may lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to declines in real property values.\nWe foreclose on and take title to the real estate serving as collateral for some of our loans as part of our business. Real estate owned by us and not used in the ordinary course of operations is referred to as OREO. In the past, increased OREO balances have led to greater expenses as we incur costs to manage and dispose of the properties. Our earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses associated with OREO, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with assets that are tied up in OREO. Any decrease in real estate market prices could lead to additional OREO write-downs, with a corresponding expense in our statement of operations. We evaluate OREO properties periodically and write down the carrying value of the properties if the results of our evaluation require it. The potential expenses associated with OREO and any further write-downs on such properties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to environmental liabilities with respect to properties that we take title to upon foreclosure that could increase our costs of doing business and harm our results of operations.\nIn the course of our activities, we may foreclose and take title to residential and commercial properties and become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to those properties. The laws and regulations related to environmental contamination often impose liability without regard to responsibility for the contamination. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. Moreover, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based upon damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be significantly harmed.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather events could negatively affect our local markets or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur market areas in Florida and Georgia are susceptible to hurricanes, tropical storms and related flooding and wind damage. Such weather events can disrupt operations, result in damage to properties and negatively affect the local economies in the markets where we operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by such future weather events will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas, but such weather events could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in the delinquencies, foreclosures or loan losses. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of future hurricanes, tropical storms, related flooding and wind damage and other similar weather events. As a result of the potential for such weather events, many of our customers have incurred significantly higher property and casualty insurance premiums on their properties located in our markets, which may adversely affect real estate sales and values in our markets.\nIf the allowance for portfolio loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual portfolio loan losses, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.\nIn the event loan customers do not repay their loans according to their terms and the collateral security for the payments of these loans is insufficient to satisfy any remaining loan balance, we may experience significant loan losses. Such credit risk is inherent in the lending business, and failure to adequately assess such credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of the borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of the loans. In determining the amount of the allowance, management reviews the loan portfolio and our historical loss and delinquency experience, as well as overall economic conditions. For larger balance non-homogeneous real estate loans, the estimate of impairment is based on the underlying collateral if collateral-dependent, and if such loans are not collateral-dependent, the estimate of impairment is based on a cash flow analysis. If management\u2019s assumptions are incorrect, the allowance may be insufficient to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance for portfolio loan losses. The allowance for portfolio loan losses is also periodically reviewed by the OFR and the FDIC, who may require us to increase the amount. Additions to the allowance for portfolio loan losses would be made through increased provision expense and would negatively affect our net income and results of operations.\nOperating expenses are high as a percentage of our net interest income and noninterest income, making it more difficult to maintain profitability.\nNoninterest expense, which consists primarily of the costs associated with operating our business, represents a high percentage of the income we generate. The cost of generating our income is measured by our efficiency ratio, which represents noninterest expense divided by the sum of our net interest income and our noninterest income. If we are able to lower our efficiency ratio, our ability to generate income from our operations will be more effective. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our efficiency ratios were 70.1%, 103.5%, and 89.2%, respectively. Generally, this means we spent approximately $0.70, $1.04, and $0.89 during those periods to generate $1.00 of income.\nIf we are unable to generate noninterest income from sales of loans originated for sale, it could have an adverse effect on our business because service charges and deposit fees are expected to continue to be under pressure.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our service charges and deposit fees were 25.1% of total noninterest income, while gains from the sale of mortgage loans and the sale of commercial loans originated for sale under government programs was 24.7% of total noninterest income. Gains earned from the sale of mortgage loans originated for sale and from the sale of commercial loans originated for sale under government programs are expected to be an increasingly larger part of our noninterest income under our business strategy. If our plans to increase our mortgage banking business and SBA/USDA lending are not successful, resulting in less loan originations or smaller levels of gains, our operating results could be materially affected.\nWe may not be able to realize our deferred tax asset.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon generating taxable income, and future tax benefits will be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense which will have a positive non-cash impact on our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our income tax provision.\nWe compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations. In addition, changes in enacted tax laws, such as adoption of a lower income tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could impact our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of other banks\u2019 difficulties or failure, which would increase the capital we need to support our growth.\nStrong competition in our primary market areas may reduce our ability to attract and retain deposits and also increase our cost of funds.\nThe Bank operates in very competitive markets for the attraction of deposits, the primary source of our funding. Historically, our most direct competition for deposits has come from credit unions, community banks, large commercial banks and thrift institutions within our primary market areas. In recent years, competition has also come from institutions that largely deliver their services over the internet. Such competitors have the competitive advantage of lower infrastructure costs and substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer services we do not provide. Particularly during times of extremely low or extremely high interest rates, we have faced significant competition for investors\u2019 funds from short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities. During periods of regularly increasing interest rates, competition for interest-bearing deposits increases as customers, particularly time deposit customers, tend to move their accounts between competing businesses to obtain the highest rates in the market. As a result, we incur a higher cost of funds in an effort to attract and retain customer deposits. We strive to grow our lower cost deposits, such as noninterest-bearing checking accounts, in order to reduce our cost of funds.\nWholesale funding sources may be unavailable to replace deposits at maturity and support our liquidity needs or growth, which could materially adversely impact our operating margins and profitability.\nThe Bank must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As part of our liquidity management, we use a number of wholesale funding sources in addition to non-maturity deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments.\nOur financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to wholesale funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected.\nOur deposit insurance premiums could be substantially higher in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as Atlantic Coast Bank, up to $250,000 per account. The amount of a particular institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution\u2019s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution\u2019s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. Recent market developments and bank failures significantly depleted the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. As a result of recent economic conditions and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, banks are now assessed deposit insurance premiums based on the bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets, and the FDIC has modified certain risk-based adjustments which increase or decrease a bank\u2019s overall assessment rate. This has resulted in increases to the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit premiums for insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the Deposit Insurance Fund to meet its funding requirements, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. If our financial condition deteriorates or if the Bank's regulators otherwise have supervisory concerns, then our assessments could rise. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability, may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, or otherwise negatively impact our operations.\nNew mortgage lending rules may constrain Atlantic Coast Bank\u2019s residential mortgage lending business.\nOver the course of the last few years, the CFPB has issued several rules on mortgage lending, notably a rule requiring all home mortgage lenders to determine a borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan. Loans with certain terms and conditions and that otherwise meet the definition of a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d may be protected from liability. In either case, the Bank may find it necessary to tighten its mortgage loan underwriting standards, which may constrain our ability to make loans consistent with our business strategies.\nConversion to Florida State-Chartered Bank and Bank Holding Company may subject the Company and the Bank to new and potentially heightened examination and reporting requirements that may increase our costs of operations and compliance.\nOn December 27, 2016, the Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, consummated the conversion of its charter from that of a federally-chartered savings bank to that of a Florida state-chartered commercial bank supervised and examined by the FDIC and the OFR. On that same date, the Company also consummated its conversion from a federal savings and loan holding company to a bank holding company supervised and examined by the FRB.\nAs a result of these conversions, the Company and the Bank may be subject to new and potentially heightened examination and reporting requirements that may increase our costs of operations and compliance.\nFinancial reform legislation has, among other things, tightened capital standards and created the CFPB and will continue to result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations and compliance.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years.\nAmong other things, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act:\n\u2022 the OCC became the primary federal regulator for federal savings banks, such as Atlantic Coast Bank (replacing the OTS), and the FRB now supervises and regulates all savings and loan holding companies that were formerly regulated by the OTS, which included the Company prior to December 27, 2016;\n\u2022 effective July 21, 2011, the federal prohibition on paying interest on demand deposits has been eliminated, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. This change has increased our interest expense;\n\u2022 the FRB is required to set minimum capital levels for depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for their insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital are required to be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions;\n\u2022 the federal banking regulators are required to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives;\n\u2022 the CFPB has been established with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like Atlantic Coast Bank, will be examined by their applicable bank regulators; and\n\u2022 federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings banks have been weakened, and state attorneys general have the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.\nIn addition to the risks noted above, we expect that our operating and compliance costs, and possibly our interest expense, could increase as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing rules and regulations. The need to comply with additional rules and regulations, as well as state laws and regulations, to which we were not previously subject, will also divert management\u2019s time from managing our operations. Higher capital levels would reduce our ability to grow and increase our interest-earning assets which would adversely affect our return on stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe are also subject to fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. Both federal/state agencies and individuals can challenge an institution's performance under these laws. This can impact our ratings under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, etc., which could negatively impact business and operations.\nAnti-money laundering laws and regulations require institutions to maintain effective programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports. If our policies and procedures are deficient, we may be subject to liability, which would negatively impact our business.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and anticipated new capital rules are uncertain and could materially adversely impact our business and ability to pay dividends or buyback our shares in the future.\nOn July 2, 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final capital rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The rules implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules phase in over time beginning in 2015 and will become fully effective in 2019. The rules apply both to our Company, which currently is not subject to formal capital rules, and Atlantic Coast Bank.\nThe final rules increase capital requirements and generally include two new capital measurements that will affect us, a risk-based common equity Tier 1 ratio and a capital conservation buffer. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital is a subset of Tier 1 capital and is limited to common equity (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and certain other items. Other instruments that have historically qualified for Tier 1 treatment, including noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, are consigned to a category known as Additional Tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that have historically been placed in Tier 2, as well as cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The final rules adjust all three categories of capital by requiring new deductions from and adjustments to capital. Beginning in 2015, our minimum capital requirements were (i) a CET1 ratio of 4.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% (up from 4%) and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (the current requirement). Our leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4% level now required of Atlantic Coast Bank. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a CET1 ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. While the final rules will result in higher regulatory capital standards, it is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards will ultimately be applied to us. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank would have been in compliance with the minimum capital requirements set forth in Basel III.\nIn addition to the higher required capital ratios that became effective in 2015, the new capital rules require new deductions from and adjustments to capital that will result in even more stringent capital requirements and changes in the ways we do business. Among other things, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain new underwriting requirements must be risk-weighted at 150%, rather than the previous 100%. There are also new risk weights for unsettled transactions and derivatives. We also will be required to hold capital against short-term commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable; currently, there are no capital requirements for these off-balance sheet assets.\nAdditionally, in any economic or regulatory environment, bank regulators may impose capital requirements that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations. The application of more stringent capital requirements for Atlantic Coast Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Higher capital requirements will reduce returns on equity and may make it more difficult to raise capital. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, could result in management modifying our business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back our shares.\nThe federal banking agencies are likely to issue new liquidity standards that could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nAs part of the Basel III capital process, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has finalized a new Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which requires a banking organization to hold sufficient \u201chigh quality liquid assets\u201d to meet liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario, and a Net Stable Funding Ratio, which imposes a similar requirement over a one-year period. The U.S. banking regulators have said that they intend to adopt such liquidity standards, although they have not yet proposed a rule. New rules could restrict our operations and adversely affect our results and financial condition, by requiring us to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nNew regulations could adversely impact our growth or profitability due to, among other things, increased compliance costs or costs due to noncompliance.\nThe CFPB has issued a rule, effective as of January 14, 2014, designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that satisfy this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d safe-harbor will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the CFPB\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain features, including, but not limited to: (i) excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans); (ii) interest-only payments; (iii) negative-amortization; and (iv) terms longer than 30 years. Also, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and/or time-consuming to make these loans, which could adversely impact our growth or profitability.\nAdditionally, on December 10, 2013, five financial regulatory agencies, including our primary federal regulator, the FRB, adopted final rules (the Final Rules) implementing the so-called Volcker Rule embodied in Section 13 of the BHCA, which was added by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Final Rules prohibit banking entities from, among other things, (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds (covered funds). The Final Rules are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions. The Final Rules also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Community banks, such as the Company, have been afforded some relief under the Final Rules. If such banks are engaged only in exempted proprietary trading, such as trading in U.S. government, agency, state and municipal obligations, they are exempt entirely from compliance program requirements. Moreover, even if a community bank engages in proprietary trading or covered fund activities under the rule, they need only incorporate references to the Volcker Rule into their existing policies and procedures. The Final Rules became effective April 1, 2014, but the conformance period has been extended from its statutory end date of July 21, 2014 until July 21, 2015. The FRB has extended the conformance period to July 21, 2016 for investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013. The FRB has also announced an extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017 for ownership interests in and relationships with legacy funds. The expiration of the conformance periods may impact the types of investments we may make, which in turn could impact our profitability.\nFlorida financial institutions face a higher risk of noncompliance and enforcement actions with the Bank Secrecy Act and other Anti-Money Laundering statutes and regulations.\nSince September 11, 2001, banking regulators have intensified their focus on Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements, particularly the Anti-Money Laundering provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Since 2004, federal banking regulators and examiners have been extremely aggressive in their supervision and examination of financial institutions located in the State of Florida with respect to institutions\u2019 Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering compliance. Consequently, a number of formal enforcement actions have been issued against Florida financial institutions.\nIn order to comply with regulations, guidelines, and examination procedures in this area, the Bank has been required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems. If the Bank or future Bank acquisitions have policies, procedures, and systems that are deemed deficient, then the Bank would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plan including its acquisition plans.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our business strategy and as a result, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nOur future success will depend on management\u2019s ability to successfully implement its business strategy, which includes managing nonperforming assets and operating expenses, continuing to grow our mortgage banking, our commercial and industrial lending, warehouse lending, and small business lending businesses, as well as our banking services to small businesses. While we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully implement our strategy, it will take time to fully implement our strategy. We expect that it may take a significant period of time before we can achieve the intended results of our business strategy. During the period we are implementing our plan, our results of operations may be negatively impacted. In addition, even if our strategy is successfully implemented, it may not produce positive results.\nAdditionally, future success in the expansion of mortgage banking, commercial and industrial lending, warehouse lending, and small business lending businesses will depend on management\u2019s ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated loan originators. The Bank competes against many institutions with greater financial resources to attract these qualified individuals. Failure to recruit and retain adequate talent could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our business and profitability.\nWe may face risks with respect to future expansion.\nTo supplement our current growth strategy, we may engage in additional de novo branch expansion, expansion through acquisitions of existing branches of other financial institutions, or the acquisition of existing financial institutions. Branch expansion, acquisitions and mergers involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022 the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners, and negotiations and consummation of any such transaction;\n\u2022 the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate;\n\u2022 the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022 our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing stockholders;\n\u2022 the diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;\n\u2022 entry into new markets where we lack experience;\n\u2022 the introduction of new products and services into our business;\n\u2022 the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with an acquisition and possible adverse effects on our results of operations; and\n\u2022 the risk of loss of key employees and customers.\nWe may incur substantial costs to expand and can give no assurance that such expansion will result in the levels of profits we would expect. We may issue equity securities, including common stock, in connection with future acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our stockholders. There is no assurance that, following any future mergers or acquisitions, our integration efforts will be successful or, after giving effect to the acquisition that we will achieve profits comparable to, or better than, our historical experience.\nOur internal controls may be ineffective.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the controls are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which we are subject, or in reducing the potential for losses in connection with such risks.\nOur enterprise risk management framework is designed to minimize or mitigate the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited in their ability to anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. The ineffectiveness of our enterprise risk management framework in mitigating the impact of known risks or the emergence of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to keep pace with technological changes, invest in technological improvements, and manage our information systems and related risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to serving clients better, the effective use of technology may increase efficiency and may enable financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in operations. We may need to make significant additional capital investments in technology in the future, and we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. Failures or interruptions affecting information technology and telecommunications systems maintained by us or our service providers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThird parties provide key components of our business infrastructure, such as banking services, processing, and internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle currently or higher volumes of use could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect our business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. Further, in some instances we may be responsible for the failure of such third parties to comply with government regulations. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and our insurance coverage may not be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in our business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the cost of doing business.\nFailure to detect or prevent a breach of our technological infrastructure or information security systems, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of a cyberattack, \u201chacking\u201d or identity theft, could disrupt our business, result in a disclosure or misuse of confidential or propriety information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, or have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of client transactions on a continuous basis. As client, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As noted, above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking and other businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and e-mail systems, software and networks to conduct our operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our clients may use personal smartphones, tablets, personal computers, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we have information security procedures and controls in places, our technologies, systems, networks and our client\u2019s devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss of destruction of our or our client\u2019s confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations.\nWe may be subject to losses due to the errors or fraudulent behavior of employees or third parties.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical recordkeeping errors and transactional errors. Our business is dependent on our employees as well as third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. We could be materially adversely affected if any of our employees cause a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems or if one of our third-party service providers experiences an operational breakdown or failure. When we originate loans, we rely upon information supplied by loan applicants and third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal and title information, if applicable, and employment and income documentation provided by third parties. If any of this information is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business, potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nThe Bank is currently subject to extensive laws and regulations, as well as supervision and examination by the FDIC (which insures the Bank\u2019s deposits) and the OFR. As a bank holding company, we are also currently subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities. Intended to protect clients, depositors, the deposit insurance fund, and the overall financial system, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations or restrictions on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that the Bank can pay to the Company, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than U.S. GAAP, among other things.\nOur operations are also subject to extensive regulation by other federal, state and local governmental authorities, and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions that impose requirements and restrictions on our operations. These laws, rules and regulations are frequently changed by legislative and regulatory authorities. In the future, changes to existing laws, rules and regulations, or any other new laws, rules or regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.\nCompliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. We are currently facing increased regulation and supervision of our industry as a result of the financial crisis in the banking and financial markets, and, to the extent that we participate in any programs established or to be established by the U.S. Treasury or by the federal bank regulatory agencies, there will be additional and changing requirements and conditions imposed on us. Such additional regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure is inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities.\nWe rely on our management team for the successful implementation of our business strategy.\nTurnover of key management and directors, or the loss of other senior managers could have a disproportionate impact on the Company and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan. As we are a relatively small bank with a relatively small management team, certain members of our senior management team have more responsibility than his or her counterpart typically would have at a larger institution with more employees, and we have fewer management-level personnel who are in a position to assume the responsibilities of our executive management team.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile due to limited trading volume.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market. However, the average daily trading volume in our common stock is relatively small, approximately 19,000 shares per day in 2016, and sometimes significantly less than that. As a result, trades involving a relatively small number of shares may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock, and it may be difficult for investors to acquire or dispose of large blocks of stock without significantly affecting the market price. If our Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (as defined under NASDAQ rules) falls below $5.0 million or the price per share of the common stock falls below $1.00 for a specified amount of time, under applicable NASDAQ rules, we will generally have 180 calendar days from the date of the receipt of the notification from NASDAQ that we have failed to comply with its applicable listing standards to regain compliance with those standards. If we are unable to regain compliance, we may have to transfer the listing of our common stock to the NASDAQ Capital Market or begin trading on the over-the-counter market, which may adversely affect the trading market for our shares.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited.\nWe have not paid dividends to our common stockholders since July 2009. Our ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory requirements and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital to meet the capital needs of our business, including capital needs related to future growth. The Company\u2019s primary source of funds available for the payment of dividends is the dividend payments we receive from Atlantic Coast Bank. A Florida state-chartered commercial bank may not pay cash dividends that would cause the bank\u2019s capital to fall below the minimum amount required by federal or state law. Accordingly, Florida state-chartered commercial banks may only pay dividends out of the total of current net profits plus retained net profits of the preceding two years to the extent it deems expedient, except no bank may pay a dividend at any time such that the total of net income for the current year when combined with retained net income from the preceding two years, produces a loss. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to pay dividends to common stockholders in the future, and, if we are able to pay dividends, we cannot provide assurances as to the amount or timing of any such dividends. If we are able to pay dividends in the future, we cannot provide assurances that those dividends will be maintained, at the same level or at all, in future periods.\nWe may need additional financing in the future, and any additional financing may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing in the future for a variety of reasons, including meeting our regulatory obligations, conducting our ongoing operations, or funding expansion, as well as to respond to unanticipated situations. We may try to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor interest. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, it could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders.\nOur Board of Directors may issue shares of preferred stock that would adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders.\nOur authorized capital stock includes 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which no preferred shares are issued and outstanding. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock from the authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. Subject to limitations imposed by law or our articles of incorporation, our Board of Directors is empowered to determine:\n\u2022 the designation and number of shares constituting each series of preferred stock;\n\u2022 the dividend rate for each series;\n\u2022 the terms and conditions of any voting, conversion and exchange rights for each series;\n\u2022 the amounts payable on each series on redemption or our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up;\n\u2022 the provisions of any sinking fund for the redemption or purchase of shares of any series; and\n\u2022 the preferences and the relative rights among the series of preferred stock.\nWe could issue preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the shares of our common stock and with preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends and in liquidation.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock, preferred stock or equity, debt or derivative securities, which could adversely affect the value or voting power of the shares of our common stock.\nIn addition to the securities that we expect to issue upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and the vesting of restricted stock, we may also issue shares of capital stock in future offerings, acquisitions or other transactions, or may engage in recapitalizations or similar transactions in the future, the result of which could cause stockholders to suffer dilution in book value, market value or voting rights. Our Board of Directors has authority to engage in some of these transactions, particularly additional equity, debt or derivative securities offerings or issuances, without stockholder approval. If our Board of Directors decides to approve transactions that result in dilution, the value and voting power of shares of our common stock could decrease.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay favored transactions, including our sale or merger or our issuance of stock or sale of assets.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and various other factors may make it more difficult and expensive for companies or persons to acquire control of us without the consent of our Board of Directors, including:\n\u2022 our classified Board of Directors;\n\u2022 notice and information requirements for stockholders to nominate candidates for election to the Board of Directors or to propose business to be acted on at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders;\n\u2022 requirement that a special meeting called by stockholders may be called only by the holders of at least a majority of all votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;\n\u2022 limitations on voting rights;\n\u2022 restrictions on removing directors from office;\n\u2022 authorized but unissued shares;\n\u2022 stockholder voting requirements for amendments to the articles of incorporation and bylaws; and\n\u2022 consideration of other factors by the Board of Directors when evaluating change in control transactions.\nIt is possible, however, that a takeover attempt could be beneficial because, for example, a potential buyer could offer a premium over the then prevailing price of our common stock which would provide an opportunity for stockholders to liquidate investments in our common stock.\nOur regulators could adversely affect our ability to enter into corporate transactions, including acquisitions of and mergers with other entities.\nThe Company is a bank holding company subject to supervisory regulation and examination by the FRB. The Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. These laws may discourage certain persons from acquiring control of us. Additionally, federal and state approval requirements may delay or prevent certain persons from acquiring us.\nAs a Maryland corporation, we are subject to Maryland General Corporation Law (MGCL). Subject to certain exceptions, MGCL provides that a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d between a Maryland corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d or an affiliate of an interested stockholder, is prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and after the five-year prohibition, any business combination between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the Board of Directors and approved by the affirmative vote of at least: (i) 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock, voting together as a single voting group, and (ii) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock other than the shares held by the interested stockholder or an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder, voting together as a single voting group.\nThe supermajority vote requirements do not apply, however, if the corporation\u2019s common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under the MGCL, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.\nThe MGCL generally defines an interested stockholder as: (i) any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the voting stock after the date on which the corporation had 100 or more beneficial owners of its stock; or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation\u2019s then-outstanding voting stock at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, and after the date on which it had 100 or more beneficial owners of its stock.\nA person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the Board of Directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder.\nThe business combinations covered by the MGCL generally include mergers, consolidations, statutory share exchanges, or, in certain circumstances, certain transfers of assets, certain stock issuances and transfers, liquidation plans and reclassifications involving interested stockholders and their affiliates, or issuances or reclassifications of equity securities.", "PERMNO": 90399, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "ACFC"}
