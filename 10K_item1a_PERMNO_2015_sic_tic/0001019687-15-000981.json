{"cik": "1140098", "company": "Ocata Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, including information in the section of this document entitled \u201cForward Looking Statements.\u201d The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to our Early Stage of Development and Capital Resources\nWe have a history of operating losses and we may not achieve future revenues or operating profits.\nWe have generated modest revenue to date from our operations. Historically, we have had net operating losses each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2014, we have an accumulated deficit of $349,134,225 and a stockholders\u2019 deficit of $2,735,545. We incurred net losses of $34,748,945, $31,022,248, and $34,584,115 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. We have limited current potential sources of income from licensing fees and we do not generate significant revenue from any other source. We have no therapeutic products currently available for sale and do not expect to have any therapeutic products commercially available for sale for a period of years, if at all. Additionally, even if we are able to commercialize our technologies or any products or services related to our technologies if approved, it is not certain that they will result in revenue or profitability.\nOur business is at an early stage of development and we may not develop therapeutic products that can be commercialized.\nOur most advanced product candidates are being prepared for use in Phase 2 clinical trials and we do not have any products that are currently in the marketplace. Though we have recently released clinical data from our Phase I/II clinical trial regarding the safety and tolerability of sub-retinal transplantation of hESC-derived RPE cells transplanted into patients with SMD and dry AMD, our potential therapeutic products will require additional extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing prior to any possible regulatory approval in the United States and other countries and may additionally require post-authorization outcome studies. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for any of our products (see the subsection entitled \u201cRegulatory Risks\u201d below), or commence or continue clinical trials for any of our products, or commercialize any products. Any of our therapeutic and product candidates may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects or other characteristics that could cause adverse effects on patient safety, efficacy or cost-effectiveness that could prevent or limit their therapeutic use, commercialization or acceptance in the medical community. Clinical trial results that we view as positive or proof of safety and/or efficacy may not be viewed in the same manner by regulators or potential collaborators. Any product using any of our technologies may fail to provide the intended therapeutic benefits, or even achieve therapeutic benefits equal to or better than the standard of treatment at the time of testing or production, or may not be safe for use in humans. In addition, we will need to determine whether any of our potential products can be manufactured in commercial quantities or at an acceptable cost, with or without third-party support. Our efforts may not result in a product that can be or will be marketed successfully. Physicians may not prescribe our products, patients may not use our products, or third-party payors may not cover or provide adequate reimbursement for our products. For these reasons and others, we may not be able to generate product revenues.\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\nWe have limited clinical testing, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sales experience capabilities, which may limit our ability to generate revenues. Due to the early stage of our therapeutic products, including regenerative medical therapies and stem cell therapy-based programs, we have not yet invested significantly in regulatory, marketing, distribution or product sales resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to invest or develop any of these resources successfully or as expediently as necessary, either alone or with strategic partners, to generate revenue.\nOur ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenue. We do not anticipate generating revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future, if ever. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:\n\u00b7 continuing and completing research and pre-clinical and clinical development of our therapeutic candidates, including Phase 2 trials of our RPE cell therapies for the treatment of SMD and dry AMD;\n\u00b7 seeking and obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals for therapeutic candidates for which we complete clinical studies;\n\u00b7 developing a sustainable, scalable, reproducible, and transferable manufacturing process for our therapeutic candidates;\n\u00b7 establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate (in amount and quality) products and services to support clinical development and the market demand for our therapeutic candidates, if approved;\n\u00b7 commercializing therapeutic candidates for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval, either by collaborating with a partner or, if launched independently, by establishing a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u00b7 obtaining market acceptance of our therapeutic candidates as a viable treatment option;\n\u00b7 adequately addressing any competing technological and market developments;\n\u00b7 implementing additional internal systems and infrastructure, as needed;\n\u00b7 identifying and validating new therapeutic candidates;\n\u00b7 negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;\n\u00b7 maintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how, to cover our existing and future products;\n\u00b7 obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors;\n\u00b7 having appropriate \u201cfreedom to operate\u201d necessary to manufacture, use and sell our existing and future products; and\n\u00b7 attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if one or more of the therapeutic candidates that we may develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate, including costs related to additional clinical studies, and such costs may exceed our estimates. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of any approved products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. The inability to do so will inhibit or harm our ability to generate revenues or operate profitably.\nOur ability to generate revenues depends on obtaining regulatory approvals for our products.\nIn order to successfully commercialize a product, we or our potential partners will be required to conduct tests and successfully complete clinical trials needed in order to meet regulatory requirements and to obtain applicable regulatory approvals. The costs of developing and obtaining regulatory approvals for therapeutics can be substantial. Our ability to commercialize any of our products in development is dependent upon the success of development efforts in clinical studies. If these clinical trials fail to produce satisfactory results, or if we are unable to maintain the financial and operational capability to complete these development efforts, we may be unable to generate revenues. Even if we obtain regulatory approvals, the timing or scope of any approvals may prohibit or reduce our ability to commercialize products successfully. For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market opportunities, have diminished or exhausted relevant patent rights, and enable other companies to develop competing products or establish market dominance. Additionally, the terms of any approvals may not have the scope or breadth needed for us to commercialize products successfully.\nWe have a limited operating history on which investors may evaluate our operations and prospects for profitable operations.\nIf we continue to suffer losses as we have in the past, investors may not receive any return on their investment and may perhaps lose their entire investment. Our prospects must be considered speculative in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development, particularly in light of the uncertainties relating to the new, competitive and rapidly evolving markets in which we anticipate we will operate. A substantial risk is involved in investing in us because, as an early stage company, we have fewer resources than an established company, our management may be more likely to make mistakes at such an early stage, and we may be more vulnerable operationally and financially to any mistakes that may be made, as well as to external factors beyond our control. We also have no experience bringing therapeutics candidates through the regulatory approval process to commercialization, and we operate with little budgetary margin for error. To attempt to address these risks, we must, among other things, further develop our technologies, products and services, successfully implement our research, development, marketing and commercialization strategies, respond to competitive developments, update our organizational structure to meet new business or market demands, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. Any failure to achieve any of the forgoing would result in an inability to achieve profitability.\nWe will need to expand our organization and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 37 full-time employees. As we mature and undertake the activities required to further develop and commercialize our therapeutic candidates, we may expand our full-time employee base and hire more consultants and contractors. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nWe have determined that material weaknesses existed in our system of internal control over financial reporting, which have in the past, and could in the future, result in a material misstatement of our annual and interim financial statements, which could have a material impact on our business and share price.\nOur ability to implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process. We expect that we will need to improve existing operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, and implement new ones, to manage our future business effectively. Any implementation delays, or disruption in the transition to new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to forecast sales, manage our supply chain, and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis.\nFurthermore we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting adequate to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In connection with the restatement of certain of our financial statements for fiscal years December 31, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, for each quarter in our fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, and for the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, we determined that we have a material weakness as of December 31, 2013, namely that our controls over the evaluation and review of complex and non-routine transactions were not effective. During the year ended December 31, 2014, management has remediated the aforementioned material weakness through a combination of hiring and training of employees.\nWe do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. As a result, we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. A material weakness means a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAny failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties that we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Any such failure could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur primary source of liquidity is our financing arrangement with Lincoln Park, and changes in our share price directly affect our ability to fund our operations.\nWe currently rely on our share purchase arrangement with Lincoln Park to fund our ongoing operations. Pursuant to the 2014 Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, the purchase price of such common stock sold to Lincoln Park is based on the prevailing market price of our common stock immediately preceding the time of sales; we control the timing and amount of any future sales, if any, of common stock. There are no upper limits to the price Lincoln Park may pay to purchase our common stock. The purchase price in most cases is directly derived from the prevailing market price of our common stock on OTCBB. Though the purchase price cannot be less than $1.00, subject to adjustment as set forth in the 2014 Purchase Agreement, this arrangement means that our prevailing share price directly affects the number of shares we need to issue to Lincoln Park at any given time to fund short-term operations. The number of shares issuable under our Certificate of Incorporation and the number of shares sellable to Lincoln Park are both limited, and a share price that falls and stays too low would make it difficult or impossible to fund our operations through sales of shares to Lincoln Park due to these limitations. As of December 31, 2014 $18,619,451 in proceeds remained available to us under the 2014 Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park.\nWe will require substantial additional resources to fund our operations and to develop our product candidates. If we cannot find additional capital resources, we will have difficulty in operating as a going concern and growing our business.\nThe biotechnology industry in general, and research and development efforts in particular, is capital-intensive. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the:\n\u00b7 Progress, interim results and costs of pre-clinical development and laboratory testing and clinical trials;\n\u00b7 time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 number of product candidates we pursue;\n\u00b7 costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims; and\n\u00b7 the costs associated with commercializing our product candidates if they receive regulatory approval, including the cost and timing of developing sales and marketing capabilities, or entering into strategic collaboration with others relating to the commercialization of our product candidates.\nOther than our arrangement with Lincoln Park, we have no sources of debt or equity capital committed for funding. Recent attempts to raise capital in the public equity markets have proven unsuccessful, and we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in any future funding effort. The timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to establish, enforce and maintain strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing;\n\u00b7 the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates of our short- and long-term capital needs, including capital needed to fund the clinical studies of our therapy candidates;\n\u00b7 scientific progress in our research and development programs;\n\u00b7 the magnitude and scope of our research and development programs;\n\u00b7 our progress with pre-clinical development and clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims; and\n\u00b7 the number and type of therapeutic candidates that we pursue.\nOur ability to execute our business strategy and sustain our infrastructure at our currently planned levels will be impacted by whether or not we have sufficient funds. Depending on market conditions and our ability to maintain financial stability, we may not have access to additional funds on reasonable terms or at all. Any inability to obtain additional funds when needed would have an adverse effect on our business and on our ability to operate on an ongoing basis.\nOur independent auditor\u2019s report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nDue to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, in their report on our audited annual financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we might have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. In addition, the inclusion of an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our lack of cash resources may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital or to enter into critical contractual relations with third parties.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaboration, strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted (with such dilution potentially being immediate and substantial), and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.\nAdditional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, or requiring us to devote specific amounts of revenue or other capital to debt service or deleveraging payments. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Any or all of the above may adversely affect the value of your investment in us.\nRisks Relating to Technology\nWe are dependent on new and unproven technologies.\nOur risks as an early stage company are compounded by our heavy dependence on unproven technologies. If these technologies do not produce satisfactory results in the clinical trial setting and/or are unable to gain regulatory approval, our business may be harmed. We have not shown an ability to bring any therapeutic candidate through the regulatory process to marketing approval. Given the unproven nature of our technology and potential product candidates, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may require additional clinical data or manufacturing practices than that required of conventional therapies or may otherwise require additional regulatory processes and reviews prior to any potential approval. Additionally, some of our technologies and potential revenue sources involve ethically sensitive and controversial issues which could become the subject of legislation or regulations materially restricting our development programs, future sales and marketing and other operations and, therefore, harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to commercially develop our technologies and proposed product lines, which, in turn, would significantly harm our ability to earn revenues and result in a loss of investment.\nOur ability to commercially develop our technologies may be limited in part by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, the success of our research and pre-clinical and field testing, the availability of collaborative partners willing and able to finance our work in pursuing applications of cell therapy technologies, and technological or other developments in the biomedical field which may render our technologies obsolete or competitively unattractive. We may not pursue one or more commercialization strategies at all if we cannot locate a collaborative partner or entity willing to fund research and development or if we cannot agree to acceptable terms governing a potential development or marketing collaboration. Our decisions regarding the ultimate products and/or services we pursue could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to earn revenue if we misinterpret trends, underestimate development costs and/or pursue wrong products or services. Any of these factors either alone or in concert could materially harm our ability to earn revenues or could result in a loss of any investment in us.\nState and/or country regulations relating to use and sale of products derived from hESCs may limit the markets we can penetrate.\nOur product candidates consist of cells derived from a renewable hESC line. Certain states have, or have shown interest in, restricting or even banning embryonic stem cell research. Similarly, there are certain countries that restrict or ban hESC research. The laws and regulations surrounding hESC research continue to evolve and change, and this may affect our ability to conduct research, development or commercialization activities these markets.\nWe may not be able to maintain our hESC line that is used for the manufacture of our product candidates reliably and cost-effectively, and we may not be able to grow those cells at sufficient scale to continue development or commercialize our product candidates.\nOperations with human cells, even with a stable, renewable hESC line, can be subject to conditions and influences that we may not be able to control. Cells could be lost due to contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment or laboratory technician error. Storage facilities could also be affected by labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors that could result in the loss of all or a portion of our cell banks. It is also possible that the cells will simply cease to function, or that materials we use in manufacturing the cells could contain viruses or other pathogens, which would result in contamination of the cells. While we take precautions to prevent the cells from ceasing to function or becoming contaminated, long-term maintenance of hESC for our purpose has not been demonstrated and we could encounter unforeseen complications, including contamination, which could result in infection in patients or other adverse effects. In addition, if not all the cells respond to the directed differentiation cues as expected, it is possible that residual hESC could result in the potential for formation of hESC-derived teratoma, a tumor comprised of tissues not normally present at the site that might arise due to uncontrolled, off-target growth of the cells.\nAs we increase production to support future development and if approved, commercialization, we may experience significant quality and cost control issues and our business could be materially harmed.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nCertain aspects of our business are dependent upon maintaining licenses with respect to key technology; if we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nSeveral of the patents we utilize are licensed to us by third parties. These licenses are subject to termination under certain circumstances (including, for example, our failure to make minimum royalty payments or to timely achieve spending, development and commercialization benchmarks). The loss of any of such licenses, or the conversion of such licenses to non-exclusive licenses, could harm our operations and/or enhance the prospects of our competitors. Certain of these licenses also contain restrictions, such as limitations on our ability to grant sublicenses that could materially interfere with our ability to generate revenue through the licensing or sale to third parties of important and valuable technologies that we have, for strategic reasons, elected not to pursue directly. The possibility exists that in the future we will require further licenses to complete and/or commercialize our proposed products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire any such licenses on a commercially viable basis.\nCertain parts of our technology are not protectable by patent.\nCertain parts of our know-how and technology are not patentable. To protect our proprietary position in such know-how and technology, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality and invention ownership agreements with us. We cannot assure you, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. Further, in the absence of patent protection, competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technology may harm our business.\nPatent litigation presents an ongoing threat to our business with respect to both outcomes and costs.\nCompanies in the life science industry typically obtain patents and frequently engage in substantial intellectual property litigation. Our products and technologies could infringe on the rights of others. If a third party successfully asserts a claim for infringement against us, we may be liable for substantial damages, be unable to sell products using that technology, or have to seek a license (which may or may not be on favorable terms) or redesign the related product. These alternatives may be uneconomical or impossible. Intellectual property litigation could be costly, result in product development delays and divert the efforts and attention of management from our business. We may also be unable to obtain licenses under economically viable terms needed to develop its technology or for certain intellectual property needed to develop and commercialize its products.\nIn addition to our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others, our success will also depend, in part, on our ability to maintain protection for our products and technologies under the patent laws of the United States and other countries. Our patent rights could be challenged by others, or if issued, could later be deemed invalid or unenforceable. Patent prosecution, related proceedings, and litigation in the U.S. and in other countries may be expensive, time consuming and ultimately unsuccessful. In addition, patents issued by foreign countries may afford less protection than is available under U.S. patent law and may not adequately protect our proprietary information. We have previously been involved in patent interference litigation, and it is possible that further litigation or patent office proceedings (such as oppositions, observations and/or reexaminations) over one or more of our own patent filings could arise. We could incur substantial litigation costs or costs associated with patent office proceedings in defending ourselves against suits or other actions brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patents against others. If the outcome of any such litigation or patent office proceeding is unfavorable, our business could be materially adversely affected. The expiration of patents on which we rely for protection of key products could diminish our competitive advantage and adversely affect our business and prospects. Our competitors may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes that design around the coverage of our patents.\nWithout additional capital, we may not have the resources to adequately defend or pursue such litigation or patent office proceedings. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology and/or the practice of our technology may infringe other third party patents, which could harm our ability to operate profitably.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries place considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Our success will depend, to a substantial degree, on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products, preserve any trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We cannot assure you that:\n\u00b7 we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7 we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u00b7 any patents issued to us will cover our products as ultimately developed;\n\u00b7 the term of any patents issued to us can be extended under the provisions of patent term extension afforded by U.S. law or similar provisions in foreign countries, where available;\n\u00b7 there is no prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim;\n\u00b7 there is no prior art of which we are aware, which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a patent claim, but which, nonetheless, ultimately may be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim;\n\u00b7 we will succeed in obtaining any patents in a timely manner or at all, or that the breadth or degree of protection of any such patents will protect our interests, or that such patents would even be enforceable;\n\u00b7 the use of our technology will not infringe on the proprietary rights of others;\n\u00b7 patent applications relating to our potential products or technologies will result in the issuance of any patents or that, if issued, such patents will afford adequate protection to us or not be challenged invalidated or infringed;\n\u00b7 if issued, patents might not be declared as unenforceable or invalid by operation of law;\n\u00b7 patents will not issue to other parties, which may be infringed by our potential products or technologies; and\n\u00b7 we will continue to have the financial resources necessary to prosecute our existing patent applications, pay maintenance fees on patents and patent applications, or file patent applications on new inventions.\nWe are aware of certain patents that have been granted to others and certain patent applications that have been filed by others with respect to iPSCs, ESCs, and other stem cell technologies. The fields in which we operate have been characterized by significant efforts by competitors to establish dominant or blocking patent rights to gain a competitive advantage, and by considerable differences of opinion as to the value and legal legitimacy of competitors\u2019 purported patent rights and the technologies they actually utilize in their businesses.\nPatents obtained by other persons may result in infringement claims against us that are costly to defend and which may limit our ability to use the disputed technologies and prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of potential products.\nA number of other pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies, universities and research institutions have patents or patent applications potentially relevant to or required in the manufacturing, storage, sale or use of our expected products. In the case of pending patent application, we cannot predict which, if any, of such applications will issue as patents or the claims that might be allowed. We are aware that a number of companies have filed patent applications, which in some cases have resulted in issued patents, relating to the generation, formulation and uses of various stem cells, as well as RPE cells, photoreceptor progenitor cells, and mesenchymal stem cells.\nIf third party patents or patent applications contain claims infringed by us or any strategic partner or other licensee of our products, such as for the manufacturing, storage, sale or use of our expected products, and such patent claims are ultimately determined to be valid and enforceable against us or our licensees, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost, if at all, or be able to develop or obtain alternative technology. If we are unable to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost, we may not be able to develop some products commercially. We may be required to defend ourselves in court against allegations of infringement of third party patents. Patent litigation is very expensive and could consume substantial resources and create significant uncertainties. An adverse outcome in such a suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties, or require us or our licensees to cease using such technology.\nChanges in U.S. patent law and in patent law in other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and therefore is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings and rulings from the European Patent Office Board of Appeals have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened and potentially eliminated the rights of patent owners in certain situations, including potentially relating to the patentability of certain cells and tissues, including those generated from hESC lines, and their uses as therapeutics. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, and equivalents bodies in other major markets, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nWe may not be able to adequately defend against piracy of intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions.\nConsiderable research in the areas of stem cells, cell therapeutics and regenerative medicine is being performed in countries outside of the United States, and a number of potential competitors are located in these countries. The laws protecting intellectual property in some of those countries may not provide adequate protection to prevent our competitors from misappropriating our intellectual property. Several of these potential competitors may be further along in the process of product development and also operate large, company-funded research and development programs. As a result, our competitors may develop more competitive or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we are able to achieve. Competitive products may render any products or product candidates that we develop obsolete.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In this event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development\nThe risk of failure of clinical development is high. Clinical studies are expensive, time-consuming, uncertain and susceptible to change, delay or termination. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not currently have marketing approval for any products. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for sale of our products, we must conduct extensive clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such product in humans for the desired indications. We are planning to initiate Phase 2 clinical studies for some of our product candidates, initially pursuing treatment of several forms of macular degeneration, such as SMD, dry-AMD and MMD. However, clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, its outcome is inherently uncertain and it will take years to obtain approval, if at all. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates for which we may seek marketing approval will be deemed by the FDA to be safe and effective enough to receive regulatory approval for the desired indications.\nDespite promising results in earlier clinical studies, including the trials for age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt\u2019s macular dystrophy, the results from our clinical studies may neither demonstrate adequate safety and effectiveness to the satisfaction of the FDA nor be predictive of the outcome of later stage trials.\nClinical trial results are subject to varying interpretation. Even if we conclude that the results from our clinical studies demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates, the FDA may not agree with us or could also conclude that the clinical study results are not clinically meaningful, that there were human errors in the conduct of the clinical study, or that for some other reason the clinical study results are inadequate to support approval. Numerous other factors could affect the timing, cost or outcome of our development efforts, including the following:\n\u00b7 conditions imposed on us by regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical studies;\n\u00b7 delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical study sites;\n\u00b7 failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals for the facilities or the processes used to manufacture our product candidates or any changes to such processes;\n\u00b7 insufficient or inadequate supply or quality of product candidates being tested or other necessary materials necessary to conduct our clinical studies;\n\u00b7 delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of our product candidates to the clinical sites;\n\u00b7 problems in engaging institutional review boards, or IRBs, to oversee trials or problems in obtaining or maintaining IRB approval of studies at each clinical study site;\n\u00b7 delays in recruiting and enrolling suitable patients to participate in our clinical studies in conformity with required protocols or projected timelines;\n\u00b7 imposition of a clinical hold on our studies by regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7 failure by our CROs, other third parties or us to adhere to clinical study requirements, comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\n\u00b7 failure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s good clinical practices, or GCPs, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\n\u00b7 delays in having patients complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7 clinical study sites or patients dropping out of a study;\n\u00b7 occurrence of undesirable toxicities, side effects or other unexpected adverse results;\n\u00b7 occurrence of serious adverse events associated with the product being tested that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits;\n\u00b7 negative or inconclusive results from our clinical studies or the clinical studies of others for similar product being tested or inability to generate statistically significant data confirming the efficacy of the product being tested;\n\u00b7 changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n\u00b7 changes in the regulatory environment, including pricing, coverage and reimbursement, that make development no longer desirable;\n\u00b7 delays in filing or acceptance of a supplement to our Biologics License Application; or\n\u00b7 failure or delays in obtaining pricing, coverage and reimbursement approvals.\nAny inability to successfully complete pre-clinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. In addition, clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our products or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our products and may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf side effects are identified during the time our products candidates are in development or after they are approved and on the market, we may either choose to or be required to perform lengthy additional clinical trials, discontinue development of the affected product candidate, change the labeling of any such products, or withdraw any such products from the market, any of which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate revenues.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. The side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete any ongoing clinical trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. Even if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, as greater numbers of patients use a product following its approval, an increase in the incidence of side effects or the incidence of other post-approval problems that were not seen or anticipated during pre-approval clinical trials could result in a number of potentially significant negative consequences, including:\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u00b7 we may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u00b7 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u00b7 our reputation with patients and healthcare providers may suffer.\nAny of these events could substantially increase the costs and expenses of developing, commercializing and marketing any such product candidates or could harm or prevent sales of any approved products.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such studies.\nWe do not independently conduct our own clinical studies but rather rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to perform this function. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it could delay our product development activities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our pre-clinical and clinical studies are conducted in accordance with the study plan and protocols and legal, regulatory, and scientific standards. We and our third party contractors are required to comply with requirements for Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nThe performance of these third parties may be adversely affected by various issues, including less advanced medical infrastructure, lack of familiarity with conducting clinical studies using U.S. standards or using our research materials, insufficient training of personnel and communication difficulties. We remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical studies is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the study. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with GCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical studies to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of patients in clinical studies are protected.\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated study plans and protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, the necessary regulatory approvals and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our products.\nIf our clinical studies fail to demonstrate safety and effectiveness to the satisfaction of the FDA or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nIf the results of our clinical studies are inconclusive or if there are safety concerns or adverse events associated with the product being tested, we may:\n\u00b7 be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for such product, if at all;\n\u00b7 obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u00b7 obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u00b7 be subject to changes with the way such product is administered;\n\u00b7 be required to perform additional clinical studies to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u00b7 have regulatory authorities withdraw their approval of such product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;\n\u00b7 be subject to the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u00b7 be sued; or\n\u00b7 otherwise experience damage to our reputation.\nEven if the results of our clinical studies are favorable, the time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable, and often can take years following the commencement of clinical studies. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all.\nThe FDA or any other regulatory authority may deny or delay an approval because it is not satisfied with the structure or conduct of clinical studies or due to its assessment of the data we supply. A regulatory authority, for instance, may not believe that we have adequately addressed negative safety issues. Clinical data is subject to varied interpretations, and regulatory authorities may disagree with our assessments of data. In any such case, a regulatory authority could insist that we provide additional data, which could substantially delay or even prevent commercialization efforts, particularly if we are required to conduct additional pre-approval clinical studies.\nClinical studies also require the review and oversight of IRBs, which approve and continually review clinical investigations and protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. An inability or delay in obtaining IRB approval could prevent or delay the initiation and completion of clinical studies, and the FDA may decide not to consider any data or information derived from a clinical investigation not subject to initial and continuing IRB review and approval.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain orphan exclusivity for our products, our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions, and our revenues will be reduced.\nThe FDA has designated MA09-hRPE cells as an orphan drug for the treatment of Stargardt\u2019s Macular Dystrophy. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity.\nEven if orphan drug designation has been granted, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for this indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing biological products. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity, that exclusivity may not effectively protect our product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same product for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later product is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan exclusivity neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time, nor gives the product any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. Orphan exclusive marketing rights may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective, if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product, or if a second applicant demonstrates its product is \u201cclinically superior\u201d to the original orphan drug.\nFinally, as a result of the expiration or successful challenge of our patent rights, we could face more litigation with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our competitors\u2019 products. The availability of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for any products that we may develop and commercialize.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical studies, which could delay or prevent our clinical studies.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in our clinical studies is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical studies depends on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical studies as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical studies, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nPatient enrollment is affected by a number of factors including:\n\u00b7 severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u00b7 design of the study protocol;\n\u00b7 estimated and actual size of the patient population;\n\u00b7 eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u00b7 perceived risks and benefits of the product being tested;\n\u00b7 proximity and availability of clinical study sites for prospective patients;\n\u00b7 availability of competing therapies and clinical studies;\n\u00b7 efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical studies;\n\u00b7 patient referral practices of physicians; and\n\u00b7 ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment.\nWe may experience difficulties with patient enrollment for our clinical studies due to the small patient populations for our proposed products, and the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove costly. Additionally, patients may be unwilling to participate in our studies due to negative publicity from adverse events in the biotechnology or other industries or for other reasons, such as concerns about the requirement of surgery with its attendant risks including infection, bleeding, loss of vision, loss of eye, death due to complication, increased risk of infection or malignancy due to immunosuppression, need for randomization of the eye to be treated and ethical concerns regarding embryonic stem cell based therapy. We may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a study, to complete our clinical studies in a timely manner.\nOur employees, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including insider trading and non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, consultants and commercial partners may engage in fraudulent or illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulators, manufacturing standards, healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Whether or not we are successful in defending against such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations.\nWe are subject to federal and state fraud and abuse laws, health information privacy and security laws, which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenge to or investigation into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.\nThere are numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims and physician transparency laws. Our relationships with providers and hospitals are subject to scrutiny under these laws. We may also be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u00b7 the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7 federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u00b7 HIPAA, which created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7 the Physician Payment Sunshine Act under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the PPACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, which is defined broadly to include other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u00b7 state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers;\n\u00b7 state laws that require manufacturers to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and\n\u00b7 state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.\nThese laws, among other things, constrain our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products. We have a variety of arrangements with our customers that could implicate these laws. Due to the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, and the range of interpretations to which they are subject to, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation. Moreover, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could negatively impact our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nHealthcare policy changes, including legislation reforming the United States healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe PPACA makes changes that are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical, biological product and medical device industries. The PPACA, among other things, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and biological products and included coordination and promotion of research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures, initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies, such as bundling of payments across the continuum of care by providers and physicians, and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies. In addition, the PPACA established an Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending. The IPAB has broad discretion to propose policies to reduce health care expenditures, which may have a negative impact on payment rates for services, including our products. The IPAB proposals may impact payments for hospital services beginning in 2020.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect until 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nThe full impact on our business of the PPACA and the other new laws is uncertain. Nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted or how such changes would affect our industry generally or our ability to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates.\nRegulatory Risks\nOur products may not receive regulatory approval, which would prevent us from commercially marketing our products and producing revenues.\nThe FDA and comparable government agencies in foreign countries impose substantial regulations on the manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products through lengthy and detailed laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Satisfaction of these regulations typically takes several years or more and varies substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the proposed product. We cannot assure you that FDA approvals for any products developed by us will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. We may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses. Even if we obtain FDA regulatory approvals, the FDA extensively regulates manufacturing, labeling, distributing, marketing, promotion and advertising after product approval. Moreover, several of our product development areas involve relatively new technologies and have not been the subject of extensive laboratory testing and clinical studies. The regulatory requirements governing these products and related clinical procedures remain uncertain and the products themselves may be subject to substantial review by the FDA and other foreign governmental regulatory authorities that could prevent or delay approval in the United States and any other foreign country. Regulatory requirements ultimately imposed on our products could limit our ability to test, manufacture and, ultimately, commercialize our products and thereby could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any inability or delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, such approvals could have a material adverse effect on the marketing of our products and our ability to generate product revenue.\nWe cannot market our product candidates until we receive regulatory approval; even if we complete the necessary pre-clinical and clinical studies, we cannot predict when or if we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate or the approval may be for a more narrow indication than we expect.\nDevelopment of our products is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. In the United States, the FDA imposes substantial requirements on the introduction of biological products and many medical devices through lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Satisfaction of these requirements typically takes several years and the time required to do so may vary substantially based upon the type and complexity of the biological product or medical device.\nProduct candidates that we believe should be classified as medical devices for purposes of the FDA regulatory pathway may be determined by the FDA to be biologic products subject to the satisfaction of significantly more stringent requirements for FDA approval. Any difficulties that we encounter in obtaining regulatory approval may have a substantial adverse impact on our business and cause our stock price to significantly decline.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates for at least one indication, we will not be permitted to market our product candidates and may be forced to cease our operations. Even if our product candidates demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical studies, the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval at all. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on any approved indications. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and the review process. Regulatory agencies also may approve a treatment candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our treatment candidates.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in a jurisdiction, the regulatory authority may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. Conditions of approval, such as limiting the category of patients who can use the product, may significantly impact our ability to commercialize the product and may make it difficult or impossible for us to market a product profitably. In addition, product manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with good manufacturing practices, or GMP, and adherence to commitments made to the FDA in the approval process. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with the facility where the product is manufactured or manufacturing issues, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nFDA approval of our products may also entail ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies, or limit how or to whom we can sell its products. Even if we obtain regulatory approval, labeling, promotional and manufacturing activities are subject to continual scrutiny by the FDA, state regulatory agencies and, in some circumstances, the Federal Trade Commission. In addition, FDA enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved products for unapproved, or off-label, uses. These regulations and the FDA\u2019s and other third-party payers\u2019 interpretation of them could materially increase our expenses, impair its ability to effectively market its products, and limit our revenue.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. In addition, if our product candidates are approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for the treatment of any indications, regulatory labeling may specify that our product candidates may be used in conjunction with other therapies. The occurrence of any of these events or penalties may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues.\nOnce obtained, regulatory approvals may be withdrawn and can be expensive to maintain.\nRegulatory approval may be withdrawn for a number of reasons, including the later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product. Regulatory approval may also require costly post-marketing follow-up studies, and failure of our product candidates to demonstrate sufficient efficacy and safety in these studies may result in either withdrawal of marketing approval or severe limitations on permitted product usage. In addition, numerous additional regulatory requirements relating to, among other things, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping will also apply. Furthermore, regulatory agencies subject a marketed product, its manufacturer and the manufacturer\u2019s facilities to continual review and periodic inspections. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is time-consuming and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.\nIf any of our product candidates is approved, we will be required to report certain adverse events involving our products to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning the advertisement and promotional labeling of our products. As a result, even if we obtain necessary regulatory approvals to market our product candidates for any indication, any adverse results, circumstances or events that are subsequently discovered could require that we cease marketing the product for that indication or expend additional money, time and effort to ensure full compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nIf our products do not comply with applicable laws and regulations our business will be harmed.\nAny failure by us or by any third parties that may manufacture or market our products, to comply with the law, including statutes and regulations administered by the FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory authorities, could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines and other civil penalties, suspension of regulatory approvals and the resulting requirement that we suspend sales of our products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, export or import restrictions, interruption of production, operating restrictions, closure of the facilities used by us or third parties to manufacture our product candidates, injunctions or criminal prosecution. Any of the foregoing actions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRestrictions on the use of hESCs, the ethical, legal and social implications of stem cell research, and negative public opinion about stem cell therapy may damage public perception of our therapeutic candidates and could prevent us from developing or gaining acceptance for commercially viable products.\nSome of our most important programs involve the use of stem cells that are derived from human embryos. The use of hESCs gives rise to ethical, legal and social issues regarding the appropriate derivation of these cells. In the event that our research related to hESCs becomes the subject of adverse commentary or publicity or increased scrutiny by governmental or regulatory organizations, our business could be harmed or otherwise substantially impaired, and the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed. Some political and religious groups have voiced opposition to our technology and practices. We use stem cells derived from human embryos that have been created for in vitro fertilization procedures but are no longer desired or suitable for that use and are donated with appropriate informed consent for research use. Also, many research institutions, including some of our scientific collaborators, have adopted policies regarding the ethical use of human embryonic tissue. These policies may have the effect of limiting the scope of research conducted using hESCs, thereby impairing our ability to conduct research in this field.\nGovernmental regulations and laws could change.\nThere can be no assurance that our operations will not be restricted by any future legislative or administrative efforts by politicians or groups opposed to the development of hESC technology or nuclear transfer technology. Additionally, the scope of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, a 16-year-old ban on U.S. federal funding for activity related to the harm or destruction of an embryo, was recently under review by the federal courts and while it was determined not to preclude funding of hESC research by the federal government, there can be no assurance that it will not be challenged again or the language modified by Congress so as to restrict government funding of hESC research. Judicial review of this or other U.S. federal or state laws, the occurrence and results of which are difficult to predict with any certainty, could result in a more restrictive interpretation of those laws than is previously the case, and may limit or require us to terminate certain of our research and therapeutic programs.\nWe may not be able to obtain required approvals in countries other than the United States.\nThe requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and cell culturing as well as the marketing approval process for our product candidates outside the United States vary widely from country to country. Foreign approvals may take longer to obtain than FDA approvals and can require, among other things, additional testing and different clinical trial designs. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval processes. Some foreign regulatory agencies also must approve prices of the products. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to market our product candidates in any foreign country. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or fail to obtain and maintain required approvals in any foreign country, we will not be able to sell our product candidates in that country and our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected.\nLicensure of our products may not be available even if safety and efficacy is demonstrated in clinical trials.\nRegulatory requirements for cell therapies, including manufacturing operations, can be different from one jurisdiction to the next in which are or intend to carry out clinical trials. The implementation or interpretation of the rules and regulations relating to manufacturing processes and source materials may occasionally be changed by the regulators, or modified or replaced by other governmental action. Our ability to obtain market authorization or the equivalent in any given jurisdiction may be dependent on our ability to demonstrate compliance with the rules and regulations covering source materials and manufacturing requirements in those jurisdictions, which we may not be able to meet.\nMA09-hRPE cells for the treatment of Stargardt\u2019s Macular Dystrophy, or any other product candidate for which we seek approval as a biologic, may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing reference product. Under the BPCI Act, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original reference product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement the BPCI Act may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWhile products approved under a BLA should qualify for the twelve-year period of exclusivity, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider the approved BLA product to be a reference product for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our potential reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nOur products may be used by physicians for indications that are not approved by the FDA. If the FDA finds that we marketed our products in a manner that promoted off-label use, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nWe plan to pursue FDA approval of product candidates for other indications other than age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt\u2019s macular dystrophy, including: myopic macular degeneration; retinal degenerative conditions; diabetic retinopathy; retinal vascular disorders; macular dysfunction, glaucoma, non-infectious uveitis and inflammatory diseases of the retina and choroid Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting any products for which we may obtain approval for off-label uses. This means that we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of a product or product candidate candidates outside of the approved indication and we may not proactively discuss or provide information on the off-label uses of products or product candidates with very specific and limited exceptions. Physicians, however, may lawfully choose prescribing products for off-label uses in the practice of medicine.\nA company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies, and even criminal sanctions. There can be no assurance that any of our clinical trials will generate data necessary to support approval of any of our product candidates. Should the FDA determine, however, that our activities constitute the promotion of off-label use, the FDA could bring action to prevent us from distributing products for the off-label use and could impose fines and penalties on us and our executives. In addition, failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising can result in, among other things, the FDA's refusal to approve a product, the suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, product recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecutions.\nIf the Office of Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or another federal or state agency determines that we have promoted off-label use of our products, we may be subject to various penalties, including civil or criminal penalties, and the off-label use of our products may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.\nIn addition to the FDA restrictions on marketing of approved products, several other types of state and federal healthcare laws have been applied by DOJ and state attorneys general to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. While physicians may prescribe products for off-label uses and indications other than the approved indications for use, if other federal or state regulatory authorities determine that we have engaged in off-label promotion through remuneration, kickbacks or other monetary benefits to prescribers, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and could be prohibited from participating in government healthcare programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. In addition, government agencies or departments could conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion and, potentially, caused the submission of false claims. Even if we are successful in resolving such matters without incurring penalties, responding to investigations or prosecutions will likely result in substantial costs and could significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and ability to finance our operations. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to patients, and, in turn, the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management's attention and result in substantial damage awards against us.\nRisks Related to Competition\nWe face intense competition and rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are engaged in activities in the biotechnology field, and particularly in the development of products for treating ophthalmological diseases and disorders, which is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments, our ability to operate profitably could suffer. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. The biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies and chemical and medical products companies operating in the fields of regenerative medicine, cell therapy, tissue engineering and tissue regeneration. Development of drug candidates for use in ophthalmology, in particular, has received a greater degree of interest and financing from global pharmaceutical companies to start-up companies. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop, or achieve earlier patent protection, regulatory approval, product commercialization and market penetration than us. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors. We cannot assure you that research and discoveries by other life science, pharmaceutical or other companies will not render our technologies or potential products or services uneconomical or result in products superior to those we develop or that any technologies, products or services we develop will be preferred to any existing or newly-developed technologies, products or services.\nWe believe potential competitors may be developing a variety of technologies and products for treating the same ophthalmological indications for which we are developing products, or indications which are similar and provide potential bases for eventually pursuing the same indications as us. In particular, there are several companies and non-profit entities working on various RPE formulations for treating macular degeneration, including Pfizer, Regenerative Patch Technologies, the Riken Center for Developmental Biology (Japan) and Cell Cure Neurosciences Ltd. (Israel). Other cell types are also being developed for subretinal use in treating various forms of macular degeneration, including by StemCells Inc. (purified human neural stem cells), Bioheart, Inc. (adipose stem cell), the University of California Davis and Retinal Associates of South Florida (CD34+ stem cells from bone marrow), Neurotech, Inc. (encapsulated cells that express CNTF) and Janssen Research & Development, LLC (umbilical cord stem cells).\nIn addition to cell-based therapies, there are a number of gene therapy, biologics and small molecule approaches (non-cell therapies) that range in development status from pre-clinical to phase III trials. Examples of companies involved in the development of gene therapy treatments for macular degeneration which may compete with our RPE programs include Oxford Biomedica, Spark Therapeutics, Avalanche Therapeutics and Genzyme. With respect to small molecules and biological agents (proteins) which may be competitive with our RPE programs, such products in development include, to illustrate, drugs that decrease oxidative stress (AREDS2, OT-551); Visual cycle modulators (emixustat, Fenretinide, ALK-001); Neuroprotectants (CNTF, NT-501, Brimonidine tartrate, Tandospirone); Drugs that reduce toxic by-products (RN6G, GSK933776); Drugs that suppress inflammation (fluocinolone acetonide, compastatin, eculizumab, lampalizumab, LFG316, ARC1905); and Vascular enhancers (MC-1101) .\nMany of these companies are well-established and possess technical, research and development, financial and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, certain smaller biotech companies have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies\u2019 potential research and development and commercialization advantages. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those we are developing. Moreover, many of these competitors may be able to obtain patent protection, obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before we do.\nThere are currently no effective long-term therapies for the diseases and medical conditions we are targeting. Nevertheless, we expect that our technologies and products will compete with a variety of therapeutic products and procedures offered by major pharmaceutical companies. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are investigating new drugs and therapeutic approaches for the same purposes, which may achieve new efficacy profiles, extend the therapeutic window for such products, alter the prognosis of these diseases or prevent their onset.\nWe are aware of ongoing clinical trials and pre-clinical development efforts directed to cell therapies as well as small molecules and biologics for treating many of the same indications for which we pursue treatments. In the case of macular degeneration, these include antibody therapies, small molecules, gene therapies and cell therapies. Some of these third party drug development programs have already reached Phase 3 in clinical trials, some with positive results for patients treated in Phase 1 or 2 of those trials. For example, Roche/Genentech is currently in Phase 3 development of a monoclonal antibody, lampalizumab, for AMD on the strength of positive Phase 2 data. We believe that our products, when and if successfully developed, will compete with these products principally on the basis of improved and extended efficacy and safety and their overall economic benefit to the health care system. Competition for any stem cell products that we may develop may be in the form of existing and new drugs, other forms of cell transplantation, ablative and stimulative procedures and gene therapy. We believe that some of our competitors are also trying to develop stem and progenitor cell-based technologies. We expect that all of these products will compete with our potential stem cell products based on efficacy, safety, cost and intellectual property positions. We may also face competition from companies that have filed patent applications relating to the use of genetically modified cells to treat disease, disorder or injury. In the event our therapies should require the use of such genetically modified cells, we may be required to seek licenses from these competitors in order to commercialize certain of our proposed products, and such licenses may not be granted.\nIf we develop products that receive regulatory approval, they would then have to compete for market acceptance and market share. For certain of our potential products, an important success factor will be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. This timing will be a function of the relative speed with which we and our competitors can develop products, complete the clinical testing and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of a product to market. These competitive products may also impact the timing of clinical testing and approval processes by limiting the number of clinical investigators and patients available to test our potential products.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in the development, pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products, in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of such products and in manufacturing and marketing such products.\nAccordingly our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for products more rapidly or effectively than we can. Our competitors may also be the first to discover and obtain a valid patent to a particular stem cell technology which may effectively block all others from doing so. It will be important for us or our collaborators to be the first to discover any stem cell technology that we are seeking to discover. Failure to be the first could prevent us from commercializing all of our research and development affected by that discovery. Additionally, if we commence commercial sales of any products, we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and sales and marketing capabilities: areas in which we have no experience.\nGeneral Risks Relating to Our Business\nWe are subject to litigation that will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome.\nOur business may bring us into conflict with our licensees, licensors or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships, or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours. If we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties, we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us. That litigation is likely to be expensive and may require a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention, at the expense of other aspects of our business. The outcome of litigation is always uncertain, and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain activities or otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nFor example, in mid-April of 2014 we received a notice of default from CAMOFI Master LDC and CAMHZN Master LDC stating that a failure by us to deliver shares of common stock issuable to this investors under convertible debentures held by these investors event resulted in an event of default under the debentures. In late April 2014, these investors delivered a notice to us stating that all amounts payable under the debentures, subject to adjustment as set forth therein, were immediately due and payable in accordance with their terms. The investors also demanded damages to which we believe they were not entitled and that they did not incur. On May 2, 2014, we paid these holders an amount that we believe satisfies all of our obligations under the debentures. However, there can be no assurance that CAMOFI Master LDC and CAMHZN Master LDC agree with our position that we have satisfied all of our obligations under the debentures and not pursue additional monetary or other damages.\nA significant adverse determination in any claim against us could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. The amount we may be required to pay, in cash or in stock, in connection with any Claim may prove to exceed our estimated reserves and, in the case of payment in the form of stock, may prove to be highly dilutive to our stockholders. Should any judgment or settlement occur that exceeds our estimate, or a new claim arise, or if we become aware of additional information that requires us to adjust our estimation of potential exposure, we may need to adjust our overall reserve and, depending on the amount, such adjustment could be material and adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nForm 4 filing delays by our former Chief Executive Officer gave rise to an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into the delays and our Section 16 compliance procedures, and this investigation resulted in penalties and sanctions against us.\nAs previously disclosed by us, in April 2013, it was determined that Gary Rabin, our then-Chief Executive Officer, failed to report 27 transactions in which Mr. Rabin sold shares of our common stock that took place between February 7, 2011 and January 10, 2013. Mr. Rabin filed a Form 4 under Section 16 of the Exchange Act on April 15, 2013 reporting the previously unreported sale transactions and correcting the total number of shares of our common stock that Mr. Rabin owned as of the date of filing of the Form 4. Our board of directors initiated an investigation into this matter upon becoming aware of it. In September 2014, we settled the SEC action arising from the SEC\u2019s investigation. Under the terms of the settlement accepted by the SEC, we consented to the entry of order under which we neither admit nor deny liability and has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $375,000, which has been previously accrued for, by July 2015. In addition, the settlement requires us to engage an independent Section 16 compliance consultant, provide Section 16(a) training to each Section 16(a) reporting person, and provide a certification of compliance that each of the preceding requirements were completed. The settlement also requires us to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 14a-9 thereunder. The terms of this settlement require us to allocate financial and management resources to complying with the settlement\u2019s terms, which may have adverse effect on our business. Also, if the SEC deems us to not have complied with any portion of the settlement, it may issue additional fines or sanctions against us which may limit our ability to issue securities or otherwise conduct our business as currently conducted.\nThe commercial success of any current or future product candidate will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community, and our products may not be accepted in the marketplace.\nIf we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, the degree of market acceptance of those products will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to provide acceptable evidence of, and the perception of patients and the healthcare community, including third party payors, of, the potential advantages of our product candidates relative to existing treatment methods;\n\u00b7 the incidence and severity of any adverse side effects of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the availability, pricing and efficacy of alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the labeling requirements imposed by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies on our products and related marketing materials, including the scope of approved indications and any safety warnings;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain sufficient third party insurance coverage or reimbursement for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the inclusion of our products on insurance company coverage policies;\n\u00b7 the willingness and ability of patients and the healthcare community to adopt new technologies or therapeutics;\n\u00b7 public opinion and acceptance of stem cell therapy in general, including media coverage and activism by religious, social or political groups;\n\u00b7 The ease of administration and procedure time associated with the use of our product candidates, including time between and frequency of dosage;\n\u00b7 our ability to manufacture or obtain from third party manufacturers sufficient quantities of our product candidates with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost to meet demand; and\n\u00b7 internal or external marketing and distribution support for our products.\nWe cannot predict or guarantee that physicians, patients, healthcare insurers, third party payors or health maintenance organizations, or the healthcare community in general, will accept or utilize any of our product candidates. Failure to achieve market acceptance would limit our ability to generate revenue and would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if any of our product candidates achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if competing products or technologies are introduced that are received more favorably or are more cost-effective.\nWe may not be able to obtain third-party payer reimbursement or favorable product pricing, which would reduce our ability to operate profitably.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize some of our proposed products in the human therapeutic field may depend on a significant degree on obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement of the costs of such products and related treatments at acceptable levels from government authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payers. We cannot assure you that coverage and adequate reimbursement in the United States or foreign countries will be available for any products we may develop or, if available, will not be decreased in the future, or that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products with a consequent harm to our business. We cannot predict what additional regulation or legislation relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such regulation or legislation may have on our business. If additional regulations are overly onerous or expensive, or if health care related legislation makes our business more expensive or burdensome than originally anticipated, we may be forced to significantly downsize our business plans or completely abandon our business model.\nOur products are likely to be expensive to manufacture, and they may not be profitable if we are unable to control the costs to manufacture them.\nOur products are likely to be significantly more expensive to manufacture than most other biologics currently on the market today. Our present manufacturing processes produce modest quantities of product intended for use in our ongoing research activities, and we have not developed processes, procedures and capability to produce commercial volumes of product. We hope to substantially reduce manufacturing costs through process improvements, development of new science, increases in manufacturing scale and outsourcing to experienced manufacturers. If we are not able to make these or other improvements, and depending on the pricing of the product, our profit margins may be significantly less than that of most biologics on the market today. In addition, we may not be able to charge a high enough price for any cell therapy product we develop, even if they are safe and effective, to make a profit. If we are unable to realize significant profits from our potential product candidates, our business would be materially harmed.\nOur current source of revenues depends on the stability and performance of our sub-licensees.\nOur ability to collect royalties on product sales from our sub-licensees will depend on the financial and operational success of the companies operating under a sublicense. Revenues from those licensees will depend upon the financial and operational success of those third parties. We cannot assure you that these licensees will be successful in obtaining requisite financing or in developing and successfully marketing their products. These licensees may experience unanticipated obstacles including regulatory hurdles, and scientific or technical challenges, which could have the effect of reducing their ability to generate revenues and pay us royalties.\nWe depend on key personnel for our continued operations and future success, and a loss of certain key personnel could significantly hinder our ability to move forward with our business plan.\nBecause of the specialized nature of our business, we are highly dependent on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified scientific and technical personnel for the research and development activities we conduct or sponsor. The loss of one or more certain key executive officers, or scientific officers, would be significantly detrimental to us. In addition, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work is critical to our success. Our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise, such as clinical testing, regulatory compliance, manufacturing and marketing, will require the addition of new management personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our present and planned activities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. The failure to attract and retain such personnel or to develop such expertise would adversely affect our business.\nOur insurance policies may be inadequate and potentially expose us to unrecoverable risks.\nAny significant insurance claims would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance availability, coverage terms and pricing continue to vary with market conditions. We endeavor to obtain appropriate insurance coverage for insurable risks that we identify, however, we may fail to correctly anticipate or quantify insurable risks, we may not be able to obtain appropriate insurance coverage and insurers may not respond as we intend to cover insurable events that may occur. We have observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For some risks, we may not have or maintain insurance coverage because of cost or availability.\nAttacks perpetrated against our information systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and exposes us to remediation costs and reputational damage.\nWe rely on information technology in virtually all aspects of our business. A significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect corporate information assets against intruders, and other operational difficulties.\nAlthough we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could lead to misappropriation of assets or data corruption and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire or implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nCyber attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems, or compromise confidential clinical and employee information. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets as a result of cyber terrorism, as well as sustained or significant cyber attacks, could also materially adversely affect our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to raise capital.\nWe have limited product liability insurance, which may leave us vulnerable to future claims we will be unable to satisfy.\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of human therapeutic products entail an inherent risk of product liability claims, and we cannot assure you that substantial product liability claims will not be asserted against us. We have limited product liability insurance. In the event we are forced to expend significant funds on defending product liability actions, and in the event those funds come from operating capital, we will be required to reduce our business activities, which could lead to significant losses. We cannot assure you that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future on acceptable terms, if at all, or that, if available, we will be able to maintain any such insurance at sufficient levels of coverage or that any such insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Whether or not a product liability insurance policy is maintained in the future, any product liability claim could harm our business or financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nStock prices for biotechnology companies have historically tended to be very volatile.\nStock prices and trading volumes for many biotechnology companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following factors (some of which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations):\n\u00b7 clinical trial results;\n\u00b7 the amount of cash resources and ability to obtain additional funding;\n\u00b7 announcements of financing transactions, research activities, business developments, technological innovations or new products by companies or their competitors;\n\u00b7 entering into or terminating strategic relationships;\n\u00b7 changes in government regulation;\n\u00b7 disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 changes in revenues or expense levels;\n\u00b7 public concern regarding the safety, efficacy or other aspects of the products or methodologies being developed,\n\u00b7 reports by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 activities of various interest groups or organizations;\n\u00b7 media coverage; and\n\u00b7 status of the investment markets.\nThis market volatility, as well as general domestic or international economic, market and political conditions, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the return on your investment.\nA significant number of shares of our common stock have become available for sale and their sale could depress the price of our common stock.\nSubstantially all of our common stock is freely tradable in the equity markets.\nWe may also sell a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock in connection with a private placement or public offering of shares of our common stock (or other series or class of capital stock to be designated in the future). The terms of any such transactions would likely require us to register the resale of any shares of capital stock issued or issuable in the transaction. For example, we currently have the ability to issue $18,619,451 worth of our common stock to Lincoln Park under the 2014 Purchase Agreement, which amount would equal 3,057,381 shares of our common stock based on the closing price of our common stock of $6.09 as of December 31, 2014.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock under any of the circumstances described above could adversely affect the market price for our common stock and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock at times and prices that you feel are appropriate.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nAny payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we may incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends.", "PERMNO": 15225, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "OCAT"}
