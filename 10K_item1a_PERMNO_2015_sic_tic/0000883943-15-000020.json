{"cik": "883943", "company": "CHRISTOPHER & BANKS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a variety of risks and thus an investment in our stock is also subject to risk. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements that are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as certain of our other filings with the SEC. Any of the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the trading price of our stock and the outcome of matters to which forward-looking statements are made in this Report. The risk factors described below should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be other risk factors not identified in this Report, that are either not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial, that could cause materially adverse effects.\nAll of our stores are located within the United States, making us highly susceptible to macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the United States, and both of these factors may have a significant impact on consumer demand for our apparel and accessories.\nOur performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions, but is particularly impacted by those in the United States, and how those conditions in turn influence consumer spending levels. Apparel retailing is a cyclical industry that is highly dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending. Purchases of specialty apparel and related goods tend to be highly correlated with the cycles of the levels of disposable income for consumers and overall consumer confidence.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods when disposable income is adversely affected. Any downturn in the U.S. economy may affect consumer purchases of our merchandise and have an adverse impact on our sales, results of operations and cash flows. Because apparel generally is a discretionary purchase, declines in consumer spending may have a more negative effect on apparel retailers than on other retailers. We may not be profitable if there is a decline in consumer spending.\nIn addition, economic conditions could negatively impact the Company's retail landlords and their ability to maintain their shopping centers in a first-class condition and otherwise perform their obligations, which in turn could negatively impact our sales, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe geographic concentration of our stores makes us particularly susceptible to economic conditions in a small number of states.\nA significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in ten states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Therefore, we are particularly dependent on local economic conditions in these states. An economic downturn in any of these states that leads to decreased consumer spending could have a disproportionate negative impact on our sales, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ability to attract customers to our stores that are located in regional malls and other shopping centers depends heavily on the success of the malls and the centers in which our stores are located, and any decrease in customer traffic to these malls and centers could cause our sales to be less than expected, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nThe majority of our current stores are located in shopping malls and other retail centers. Sales at these stores are derived in considerable part from the volume of traffic generated in those malls or retail centers and surrounding areas. To take advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers, we need to maintain or acquire stores in desirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is strong. Our stores benefit from the ability of nearby tenants to generate consumer traffic near our stores, and the continuing popularity of the regional malls and outlet, lifestyle and power centers where our stores are located. Customer traffic and, in turn, our sales volume may be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors. A reduction in customer traffic could result in lower sales and leave us with excess inventory. In such circumstances, we may have to respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory, which could adversely impact our merchandise margins and operating income.\nContinuing to improve our store productivity will be largely dependent upon our success in converting stores to the missy, petite and women\u2019s format (\u201cMPW stores\u201d) and the performance of our outlet stores, as well as in maintaining or increasing customer traffic in our stores and converting that traffic into sales.\nImproving the profitability of our existing stores and optimizing store productivity is critical to our future growth and profitability. Our ability to increase the productivity of our stores will be largely dependent upon our ability to continue to rationalize our existing store portfolio, primarily through store conversions and new outlets, as well as our ability to generate customer traffic to our stores and to convert that traffic into sales.\nOver the past several years, the Company has opened a number of outlet stores and either opened or converted existing stores into MPW stores. We expect that the continued conversion of stores to the MPW format and the opening of additional outlet stores will increase our store productivity by eliminating overlap in certain markets and allow management to focus its resources, such as store merchandise inventories and capital expenditures, on a more streamlined and more productive store base. If the improvements in store productivity are not at the level that we expect, our revenues, margins, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing all of our store locations.\nWe currently lease all of our store locations. Our leases range from month-to-month to approximately ten years in length. A number of our leases have early termination provisions that apply if we do not achieve specified sales levels after an initial term and, in some cases, allow us to pay rent based on a percent of sales if we fail to achieve certain specified sales levels. The leases for approximately 33% of our store base expire between February 1, 2015 and January 30, 2016. We believe that, over the last few years, we have generally been able to negotiate favorable rental rates and extend leases due, in part, to the state of the economy and higher than usual vacancy rates. It is possible this trend may not continue and that we may not be able to renew our leases on as favorable terms, or in certain circumstances, at all. As a result, we may need to pay higher occupancy costs or close stores, which could adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations and ability to generate positive cash flow.\nOur growth plan is dependent upon our ability to successfully implement our strategic and tactical initiatives.\nThe Company has implemented a growth plan that contemplates sales per store to grow at a low-single digit rate; improved selling, general and administrative expense leverage; and gross margin expansion intended to result in operating income as a percentage of net sales in the high single digits over the long term. Our ability to achieve our growth plan depends upon a variety of factors, including a number of factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to successfully implement and execute the strategic and tactical initiatives underlying our growth plan, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to sustain an acceptable level of gross margins, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, profitability and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s gross margins have improved over the past several fiscal years. However, our ability to maintain or improve these margins is subject to a variety of challenges. The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to consumers, which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions\nwith comparable reductions in our operating costs or cost of goods. If our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, it will adversely impact our operating income. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur sales and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to retain our current leadership team and to attract, develop and retain qualified employees.\nOur business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization in order to timely deliver and display fashionable, quality merchandise in appropriate quantities in our stores. This execution requires experienced and talented management. Our continued success will also depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our executive officers and senior personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain their services.\nThere is considerable competition for personnel in the retail industry. Like most retailers, we experience significant employee turnover rates, particularly among store sales associates and store managers. We therefore must continually attract, hire and train new personnel to meet our staffing needs. If we are unable to maintain or lower our turnover rate or attract, train, assimilate and retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able to service our customers as effectively, which could impair our ability to increase sales and could otherwise harm our business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive retail apparel industry. The size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, which could reduce our revenues and gross margins.\nThe women's specialty retail apparel business is highly competitive. We believe we compete primarily with department stores, specialty stores, discount stores, mass merchandisers, business to consumer websites, off-price retailers and direct marketers that sell women's apparel. Because a number of our competitors are companies with greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources available to them, and may offer a broader selection of merchandise than we do or maintain comparatively lower costs of operations, we may lack the resources to effectively compete with them. They may be able to adapt to changes in customer preferences more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. Given greater financial resources and larger staff, our competitors may be better able to prioritize and manage large or complex projects, as well as respond more quickly to economic, operational, regulatory or organizational changes. Further, we do not typically advertise using television or radio media and thus do not reach customers through methods some of our competitors may use. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable store locations, lease terms and qualified associates. Increased competition in any of these areas may result in higher costs, which could reduce our revenue and gross margins.\nFailure to successfully manage and execute our marketing initiatives could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur future success and growth is dependent on both retaining existing customers and acquiring new customers in order to gain sales momentum in our stores and drive traffic to our website. Successful marketing efforts require the ability to reach customers through various methods of communication. A number of our marketing programs are planned well in advance of the date the related product is available for sale. Our inability to accurately predict our customers\u2019 preferences, to utilize their desired mode of communication, or to ensure availability of advertised products could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur ability to anticipate or react to changing consumer preferences in a timely and accurate manner and offer a compelling product at an attractive price impacts our sales, gross margins and results of operations.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to consistently gauge and respond on a timely basis to fashion trends and provide a balanced assortment of merchandise that satisfies changing fashion tastes and customer demands for style, fit, quality and price. Forecasting consumer demand for our merchandise is challenging. In addition, our merchandise assortment differs from season to season and, at any given time, our assortment may not resonate with our customers in terms of style, fit, quality or price. Generally, we begin the design process for apparel six to nine months before the merchandise is available to customers, and we typically begin to make purchase commitments several months in advance of delivery to stores. These lead times can make it difficult for us to respond quickly to changes in the demand for our\nproducts or to adjust the cost of the product in response to customers' fashion or price preferences. Any missteps may affect merchandise desirability and gross margins, and result in excess inventory levels, which could impair our profitability.\nIf we miscalculate the market for our merchandise, our customers' tastes or purchasing habits or the demand for our products, we may have fewer sales at an acceptable mark-up over cost. As a result, we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups over cost, or below cost, which would have an adverse effect on our margins and results of operations. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our merchandise, we may experience inventory shortages, resulting in missed sales opportunities and lost revenues.\nThere are risks associated with our eCommerce business.\nWe sell merchandise over the internet through our web site, www.christopherandbanks.com, which represents a modest percentage of our overall net sales. Our eCommerce operations are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\nunanticipated operating problems;\n\u00b7\nrapid technological change;\n\u00b7\nthe successful implementation of, and costs to implement, new systems and upgrades;\n\u00b7\nreliance on a single third-party relating to the operation of the website, order fulfillment and customer service;\n\u00b7\nreliance on third-party computer hardware and software;\n\u00b7\nthe need to invest in additional computer systems;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of sales from our stores;\n\u00b7\nliability for on-line content;\n\u00b7\nlack of compliance with, or violations of, applicable state or federal laws and regulations, including those relating to privacy and the resulting impact on consumer purchases;\n\u00b7\nincreased or unfavorable governmental regulation of eCommerce (which may include regulation of privacy, data protection, eCommerce payment services and other related topics);\n\u00b7\ncredit card fraud;\n\u00b7\nsystem failures or security breaches and the costs to address and remedy such failures or breaches; and\n\u00b7\nuntimely delivery of our merchandise to our customers by third parties.\nIf we do not successfully manage these operations, we may not realize the full benefits of our Omni-Channel business model, which could adversely affect our results of operations. There also can be no assurance that our eCommerce operations will meet our sales and profitability plans, and the failure to do so could negatively impact our revenues and earnings.\nCosts of raw materials, commodities, transportation or labor may rise resulting in an increase in component and delivery costs, and overall product costs, all of which could erode margins and impact our profitability.\nThe raw materials and labor used to manufacture our products and our transportation and contract manufacturing labor costs are subject to availability constraints and price volatility. The results of our business operations could suffer due to significant increases or volatility in the prices of certain commodities, including but not limited to cotton, polyester and other items used in the production of fabric and accessories, as well as fuel, oil and natural gas. Price increases of these items or other inflationary pressures may result in significant cost increases for our raw materials, product components and finished products, as well as increases in the cost of distributing merchandise to our retail locations. Consequently, higher product costs as a result of one or more of these factors could have a negative effect on our gross profits, as we may not be able to pass such costs on to our customers.\nOur reliance on foreign sources of production poses various risks.\nFor the last fiscal year, we directly imported approximately 39% of our merchandise, and much of the merchandise we purchase domestically is made overseas. Substantially all of our directly imported merchandise is manufactured in Asia.\nBecause a significant portion of our merchandise is produced overseas, we are subject to the various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as:\n\u00b7\ndelays in the delivery of cargo;\n\u00b7\nimposition of, or increases in, duties, taxes or other charges on imports;\n\u00b7\nnew legislation or regulations relating to increased tariffs, import quotas, embargoes, customs or other trade restrictions that may limit or prohibit merchandise that may be imported into the United States from countries or regions where we do business, or increase the cost or reduce the supply of the merchandise we purchase;\n\u00b7\nfinancial or political instability in any of the countries in which our merchandise is manufactured;\n\u00b7\nsignificant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies or restrictions on the transfer of funds, or additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or foreign governments;\n\u00b7\nsupply chain security initiatives undertaken by the United States or foreign governments that delay or impede the delivery of imports and normal flow of product;\n\u00b7\ndelayed receipt or non-delivery of goods due to the failure of suppliers to comply with applicable import regulations;\n\u00b7\ndelayed receipt or non-delivery of goods due to labor strikes or unexpected or significant port congestion at United States or foreign ports;\n\u00b7\npotential recalls or cancellations of orders for any merchandise that does not meet our quality standards;\n\u00b7\ninability to meet our production needs due to labor shortages;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters, extreme weather, political or military conflicts, terrorism, disease epidemics and public health related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in affected areas; and\n\u00b7\nthe United States may impose new initiatives that adversely affect the trading status of countries where our apparel is manufactured. These initiatives may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that, if enacted, would increase the cost of products imported from countries where our suppliers manufacture merchandise.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or a combination of them, could increase our costs or result in our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise, thereby negatively impacting sales, gross profit and operating income.\nIt is also possible that the inability of our suppliers to access credit may cause them to extend less favorable terms to us, which could adversely affect our cash flows, margins and financial condition. Additionally, delays by our vendors in supplying our inventory needs could cause us to incur more expensive transportation charges, which may adversely affect our margins.\nOur reliance on a few suppliers means that our business could suffer if we needed to replace them.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Instead we depend on independent third parties to manufacture our merchandise. For the most recently completed fiscal year, our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70% of the merchandise we purchased, and we purchased 27.6% and 9.5% of our goods respectively from our two largest suppliers.\nWe generally maintain non-exclusive relationships with the suppliers that manufacture our merchandise, and we compete with other companies for production facilities. As a result, we have no contractual assurances of continued supply or pricing, and any supplier, including our key suppliers, could discontinue selling to us at any time. Moreover, a key supplier may not be able to supply our inventory needs due to capacity constraints, financial instability or other factors beyond our control, or we could decide to stop using a supplier due to quality or other performance or cost issues. If we determined to cease doing business with one or more of our key suppliers or if a key supplier were unable to supply desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms, we could experience delays in receipt of inventory until\nalternative supply arrangements were secured; such delays could result in lost sales and adversely effect our results of operations and cash flow.\nIf third parties with whom we do business do not adequately perform their functions, we might experience disruptions in our business, resulting in decreased profits, or losses, and damage to our reputation.\nWe depend upon independent third parties, both domestic and foreign, for the manufacture of all of the goods that we sell. The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our standards could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe also use third parties in various aspects of our business to support our operations. We have a long-term contract with a third party to manage most of our eCommerce operations, including order management, order fulfillment and customer service. We rely on third parties to inspect the factories where our products are made for compliance with our vendor code of conduct. From time-to-time we may rely on a third party for assistance with the implementation and/or management of certain aspects of our information technology infrastructure. We also rely on third parties to transport merchandise and deliver it to our distribution center, as well as to ship merchandise to our stores and to our third-party eCommerce fulfillment center.\nFailure by any of these third parties to perform these functions effectively and properly, or any disruption in our business relationships with any of these third parties, could negatively impact our operations, profitability and reputation.\nOur business could suffer if one or more of our suppliers fails to comply with applicable laws or to follow acceptable labor practices, or is accused of such non-compliance.\nWe expect the manufacturers of the goods that we sell to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and comply with our social compliance program. Although each of our purchase orders requires adherence to accepted labor practices, applicable laws and compliance with our vendor code of conduct, we do not supervise or control our suppliers or the manufacturers that produce the merchandise we sell. Our staff and the staff of third-party auditing services periodically visit to inspect the operations of a number of our independent manufacturers to, among other things, assess compliance with our vendor code of conduct. Nonetheless, we cannot ensure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using ethical or legal labor practices, and the violation of any labor or other laws, or the divergence from ethical labor practices, by any of our suppliers or their U.S. or non-U.S. factories could damage our reputation, interrupt or disrupt shipment of products, result in a decrease in customer traffic to our stores or website and adversely affect our sales and net income. Because manufacturers act in their own interests, they may act in a manner which results in negative public perceptions of us. Moreover, apparel companies can, in some cases, be held jointly liable for the wrongdoings of the manufacturers of their products. Therefore, in certain circumstances, we may be subject to liability or negative publicity which could adversely affect our brand and our business as a result of actions or a lack of actions taken by these manufacturers.\nOur business could suffer if parties with whom the Company does business become insolvent or otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company.\nWe are party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including vendors, suppliers, service providers and lenders, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to us. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, our rights and benefits pursuant to these contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to us, or otherwise impaired. We cannot make any assurance that we would be able to arrange alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships with other third parties on terms as favorable as our existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on our part to do so could negatively affect our cash flows, financial condition and business.\nThere are risks relating to the transportation of our merchandise to our distribution center, to our stores, and to our eCommerce customers.\nWe currently rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments, including shipments to our distribution center, our stores, our eCommerce fulfillment center and our eCommerce customers. Our use of outside delivery services for shipments is subject to a variety of risks which may impact a shipper's ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. If we change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely impact deliveries and we would incur costs and expend resources in connection with such a change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the independent third-party transportation providers we currently use, which would increase our costs.\nIn addition, because the vast majority of our products are shipped by ocean from overseas, there are risks associated with a disruption in the operation of ports through which our products are imported. If a disruption occurs, we are likely to experience delays in the receipt of products, and we or our suppliers may have to find alternative shipping methods, possibly at greater expense, increased lead times and increased costs of our goods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. As a large part of our merchandise is produced in Asia, it is largely shipped to us through the ports on the West Coast. The lengthy and contentious contract negotiations with respect to longshore labor agreements on the West Coast have resulted in port slowdowns and port congestion, which in turn has led to the delayed receipt of merchandise and adjustments in our marketing promotions as a result. These delays may result in lost sales and lower gross margins due to the lack of seasonality of the product at time of receipt, and thus adversely affect our results of operations, gross profit and cash flows.\nWe depend on a single facility to conduct our operations and distribute our merchandise. Our business could suffer a material adverse effect if this facility were shut down or its operations severely disrupted.\nOur corporate headquarters and our only distribution facility are located in one facility in Plymouth, Minnesota. Our distribution facility supplies merchandise to our retail stores and our third party eCommerce provider. Any serious disruption to our distribution facility or a shut down for any reason, could delay shipments to stores and our eCommerce fulfillment center and result in inventory shortages which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations. In addition, much of our computer equipment and all of our senior management, including critical resources dedicated to merchandising, finance and administrative functions, are located at our corporate headquarters. In the event of a disaster or other calamity impacting our corporate facility, our management and staff would have to find and operate out of other suitable locations. We have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating such satellite facilities might have on business, personnel and results of operations.\nAlthough we maintain business interruption and property insurance, we cannot be assured that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or that any insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us if our distribution center or corporate offices were shut down for any unplanned reason.\nIf our long-lived assets become impaired, we may need to record significant non-cash impairment charges.\nPeriodically, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Significant negative industry or general economic trends, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets (such as store relocations or closures) may result in impairment charges. Any such impairment charges, if significant, would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAdverse and/or unseasonable weather conditions in the United States could have a disproportionate effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. For example, inclement weather conditions can make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and/or result in temporary store closures or reduced hours of operation. This will likely\nresult in reduced traffic in our stores and a corresponding reduction in sales and gross margin dollars. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our merchandise offerings incompatible with those unseasonable conditions in the affected areas. Such unseasonable weather conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, acts of war or other catastrophes could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, disruptive global political events, or similar catastrophes could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. To the extent these events result in the closure of our distribution center, corporate headquarters, or a significant number of our stores, or impact one or more of our key third-party providers of services or goods, our operations and financial performance could be adversely affected. These events also could have indirect consequences, such as loss of property or other damage which may or may not be covered by insurance.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information technology systems and our ability to maintain and upgrade these systems from time-to-time and operate them in a secure manner. Any failure, interruption or compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and cash flows.\nThe efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent on our information technology systems (\u201cIT systems\u201d). In particular, we rely on point-of-sale terminals, which provide information to our host analysis systems used to track sales and inventory, and we rely on our eCommerce website through which we sell merchandise to our customers. The host systems help integrate our design, third-party manufacturing, distribution and financial functions, and we integrate with our reporting structure to provide daily financial and sales information. Although our data is backed up and securely stored off-site, our main data center is located at our headquarters in Plymouth, Minnesota. The data center and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u00b7\nfire, flood and other natural disasters;\n\u00b7\ngenerator loss, computer systems failures, technical malfunctions, inadequate systems capacity, Internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator negligence, improper operation by or supervision of employees and similar events;\n\u00b7\nphysical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, IT systems appropriation and similar events; and\n\u00b7\ncomputer viruses or software bugs.\nAny disruption in the operation of our IT systems, the loss of key employees knowledgeable about such systems or our failure to continue to effectively enhance such systems could interrupt our operations or interfere with our ability to sell goods in-store, which could result in reduced sales and affect our operations and financial performance. In addition, any interruption in the operation of our Internet website could cause us to lose sales due to the temporary inability of customers to purchase merchandise through our website.\nFrom time-to-time, we improve and upgrade our IT systems and the functionality of our Internet website in an effort to ensure they meet our evolving business and security needs and are adequate to handle business growth. The cost of any such system upgrades or enhancements can be significant. We are currently in the process of implementing our Customer First initiative which involves an upgrade to, and greater integration among, our customer relationship management system, our order management system and our eCommerce and brick and mortar stores. If we are unable to maintain and upgrade our operating systems or Internet website, or effectively integrate new and updated systems, software or changes to our operating systems or our Internet website in an efficient, timely and secure manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. While we believe that we are diligent in selecting vendors, systems and third party providers to assist us in maintaining the integrity of our information technology systems, we realize that there are risks and that no guarantee can be made that future disruptions, service outages and failures or unauthorized intrusions will not occur.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and may incur additional expenses in order to mitigate such risks or in response to unauthorized access to our data. In addition, an incident in which we fail to protect our customers' information against a security breach could result in costly government enforcement actions and monetary damages against us from private litigation and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe Company and our third-party service providers that manage portions of the Company\u2019s data are subject to cyber security risk. The nature of our business involves the receipt and transmission, and in some cases storage, of customers\u2019 personal information, shopping preferences and credit and debit card information, in addition to employee information and the Company\u2019s financial and strategic data. The protection of our customers\u2019 data, as well as internal Company data is vitally important to the Company. The Company and its third-party service providers employ systems and/or websites that are intended to provide secure storage and/or transmission of proprietary or confidential information by us and these third-party service providers. While the Company has implemented measures to prevent and detect security breaches and cyber incidents, any failure of these measures and any failure of third parties that assist the Company in managing its data could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the Company expects our third-party service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures to protect the proprietary and confidential information once it is received, we cannot control these service providers and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data, disable or degrade storage service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we and the service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties acting on our behalf, through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees or those of our third-party providers. Despite our preventative efforts and those of our third-party service providers, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, privacy attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events which could expose us and our third-party service providers to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary and confidential information, litigation and potential liability. Cyber security attacks may be targeted at us, our third-party service providers, or our customers. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur significant additional expense, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Any cyber security or security breaches, including any breaches that result in theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer, employee or company information, or our lack of compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations, may result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, including claims for unauthorized purchases with stolen credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims, and considerable other additional expenses. Some or all of these costs may not be adequately covered by our insurance, and could result in a loss of confidence in our security measures, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our brand, business and reputation.\nConsumer awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats is very prevalent. Any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us or our service providers, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. Should customers lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, they may discontinue shopping in our stores or on our website.\nState and federal laws on privacy continue to evolve and further limits on how we collect or use customer information could adversely affect our business.\nWe collect and store customer information primarily for marketing purposes. Some of this information is subject to federal and state privacy laws. These laws and the judicial interpretation of such laws are evolving on a frequent basis. If we fail to comply with these laws, we may be subject to fines or penalties, which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any compromise of customer information could subject us to customer, third-party or government litigation and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Any limitations imposed on the use of such customer information, whether imposed by federal or state governments or business partners, could have an adverse effect on our future marketing activities. Governmental focus on data security and/or privacy may lead to additional legislative action, and the increased emphasis on information\nsecurity may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security. As a result, we may have to modify our business with the goal of further improving data security, which would result in increased expenses and operating complexity.\nA failure to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on the use of credit and debit cards to complete sale transactions in our stores and through our website, and because of such use are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI Standards\u201d). If we fail to comply with the PCI Standards, we may become subject to fines or limitations on our ability to accept credit or debit cards, which could adversely affect our sales and operating income. Also, any changes we may be required to make to our private label credit card program in the future could adversely affect the promotional financing arrangements available to our credit card customers and therefore our operating results.\nThe sufficiency and availability of our sources of liquidity may be affected by a variety of factors.\nThe sufficiency and availability of our sources of liquidity may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation: (i) the level of our operating cash flows, which are impacted by consumer acceptance of our merchandise, general economic conditions and the level of consumer discretionary spending; and (ii) our ability to maintain borrowing availability and to comply with applicable covenants contained in our Credit Facility.\nOur ability to continue to be profitable and to generate positive cash flows is dependent upon many factors, including favorable economic conditions and consumer confidence and our continued successful ability to execute our financial plan and strategic and tactical initiatives. There can be no assurance that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient at all times to support our Company without additional financing or credit availability. An inability to generate sufficient cash flow could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow money;\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult for us to open new stores or improve or expand existing stores; and\n\u00b7\nrequire us to incur significant additional indebtedness.\nShould we be unable in the future to borrow under the Credit Facility, it is possible, depending on the cause of our inability to borrow, that we may not have sufficient cash resources for our operations. If that were to occur, our liquidity would be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAccess to additional financing from the capital markets may be limited.\nWhile we have availability under our Credit Facility to bolster our liquidity, we may need additional capital to fund our operations, particularly if our operating results and cash flows from operating activities were to decrease or if the Credit Facility were unavailable. The sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities in order to improve our liquidity could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we borrow under our Credit Facility or incur other debt, our expenses will increase and we could be subject to additional restrictions that may limit our operating flexibility. Newly issued securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior or otherwise superior to those of our common stock. There is no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be more vulnerable to any future downturns in our business or the general economy. Future increases in interest rates or other tightening of the credit markets, or future turmoil in the financial markets, could make it more difficult for us to access funds, to refinance our indebtedness (if necessary), to enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or to obtain funding through the issuance of our securities.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe SEC has promulgated final rules pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as conflict minerals, included in components of products either manufactured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture. These rules require due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo (the \u201cDRC\u201d) or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the DRC. The first conflict minerals report required by the rules was filed as required by June 2, 2014 and is due annually thereafter. While we do not manufacture products, we may be deemed to contract to manufacture products. There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the origin of conflict minerals used in any products we are deemed to contract to manufacture. In addition, by Executive Order in July 2014, the President expanded the sanctions criteria against United States companies to include the direct or indirect support of entities that engage in the illicit trade of the natural resources of the DRC. Complying with these rules and sanctions could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. Also, we may face reputational challenges and potential fines or penalties if we fail to comply with these rules and sanctions.\nOur ability to maintain the value of our brands and our trademarks impacts our business and financial performance.\nThe Christopher & Banks and C.J. Banks brand names are integral to our business. Maintaining, promoting, positioning and growing our brands will depend largely on the success of our design, merchandising and marketing efforts and on our ability to provide a consistent and positive customer experience. Also, our success depends on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers to shop our brand. Our business could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives for our brands. In addition, our public image and reputation could be tarnished by negative publicity. Any of these events could negatively impact sales.\nWe also believe that our \u201cchristopher & banks\u201d, \u201ccj banks\u201d and related trademarks are important to our success and we register a number of our trademarks in the United States in an effort to protect them. Even though we take actions to establish, register and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights, we cannot be sure that we will be successful or that others will not imitate or infringe upon our intellectual property rights. In addition, we cannot assure that others will not seek to block the sale of our products as infringements of their trademark and proprietary rights. If we cannot adequately protect our existing and future trademarks or prevent infringement of them, our business and financial performance could suffer. In addition, others may assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other intellectual property rights or in marks that are similar to ours, and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. Our inability to protect our trademarks could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be subject to adverse outcomes in current or future litigation matters or regulatory proceedings which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources.\nFrom time-to-time, we may be involved in litigation, regulatory actions and other claims against our business. There are also other types of claims that could be asserted against us based on litigation that has been asserted against others, particularly in the retail industry. These matters typically arise in the ordinary course of business but, in some cases, could also raise complex factual and legal issues requiring significant management time and, if determined adversely to the Company, could subject the Company to material liabilities.\nIn recent years, there has been increasing activity by companies which have acquired intellectual property rights, but do not practice those rights (sometimes referred to as \u201cpatent trolls\u201d), to engage in very broad licensing programs aimed at a large number of companies in a wide variety of businesses, or at retail companies specifically. These efforts typically involve proposing licenses in exchange for a payment of money and may also include the threat or actual initiation of litigation for that purpose. Any such litigation can be costly to defend, even if unsubstantiated or invalid. We may also receive communications, from time-to-time, from patent trolls relating to their intellectual property and, in some cases, to proposed licenses. It is not possible to predict the impact, if any, of such claims on our business and operations.\nAn unfavorable outcome in any future litigation or regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings can be expensive and require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nChanges in accounting rules and regulations, or failures in our internal controls may cause us to inaccurately report our financial results or to fail to prevent fraud which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges to and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules and regulations may occur in the future, as well as new accounting rules or regulations. Such changes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we maintain a documented system of internal controls which is reviewed and monitored by management, who meet regularly with our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We devote significant resources to document, test, monitor and improve our internal controls and will continue to do so; however, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our controls are adequate in the future or that adequate controls will be effective in preventing fraud. As of January 31, 2015, the Company concluded that a material weakness existed in its internal control over financial reporting as described in Item 9A - Controls and Procedures. Due to the material weakness, management performed additional analysis and procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report were presented fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and fairly present in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls or to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover. We are entitled to certain other protective provisions under Delaware law.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third-party to acquire control of the Company, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable by, among other things:\n\u00b7\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the Board to designate and issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock;\n\u00b7\nlimiting persons who can call special meetings of the Board of Directors or stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a stockholders\u2019 meeting.\nWe may be subject to increased labor costs.\nOur retail store operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions and overtime pay. If federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Similarly, if federal overtime regulations change, more of our employees may be entitled to overtime pay, which could also increase our labor costs. Wage actions by other retailers may require us to increase wage rates in order to attract and retain talented employees. Labor shortages and increased employee turnover could also increase our labor costs. This in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline.\nContinued changes in the health care regulatory environment could cause us to incur additional expense, and our failure to comply with related legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law in the United States. This legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage of those already insured. The changes required by this legislation could cause us to incur additional health care and other costs, but we do not expect any material short-term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation. However, the costs and other effects of any new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty.", "PERMNO": 77478, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "CBKC"}
