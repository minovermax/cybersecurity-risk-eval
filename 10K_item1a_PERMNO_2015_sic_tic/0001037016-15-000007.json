{"cik": "1037016", "company": "NII HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvestors should be aware that we and our business are subject to various risks, including the risks described below. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of any investment. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below and included elsewhere. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations.\n1.\nThe filing of a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code will subject the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties and may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, results of operations, brand or business prospects, and any plan of reorganization implemented in the bankruptcy proceeding is expected to provide that holders of claims and interests with respect to our equity securities, or rights to acquire our equity securities, would be entitled to no recovery and that those claims and interests would be canceled for little or no consideration.\nOn September 15, 2014, NII Holdings, Inc. and certain of our subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11. As a result of this filing, our operations could be adversely affected, and there can be no assurances as to the length of the bankruptcy proceeding or whether any plan of reorganization will be approved by our creditors and confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. While we expect to continue normal operations, upon commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding, transactions outside the ordinary course of business require Bankruptcy Court approval, which may limit our ability to timely respond to certain events or to take advantage of certain opportunities. The impact of the bankruptcy proceeding cannot be accurately predicted or quantified, and during the bankruptcy proceedings, we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties relating to our ability to:\n\u2022\nobtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in the bankruptcy proceedings from time to time;\n\u2022\nobtain creditor and Bankruptcy Court approval for, and then to confirm, a plan of reorganization to emerge from bankruptcy;\n\u2022\nattract and retain customers who may be unwilling to conduct business with us as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings;\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain acceptable terms with vendors and service providers and to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;\n\u2022\nattract, motivate and retain key employees;\n\u2022\nexecute transactions outside of the normal course of business; and\n\u2022\nexecute our business plan.\nIn addition, we currently expect that, under any plan of reorganization implemented in the bankruptcy proceedings, the holders of claims and interests with respect to our equity securities, or rights to acquire our equity securities, will not be entitled to any recovery and that those claims and interests will be canceled for no consideration.\n2.\nThe inability to complete the sale of Nextel Mexico may have an adverse effect on our ability to emerge from bankruptcy and future liquidity.\nThe completion of the sale of Nextel Mexico is subject to several conditions, including: (i) the Bankruptcy Court having entered all appropriate orders; (ii) obtaining all required governmental approvals; (iii) the absence of a material adverse effect on Nextel Mexico; and (iv) certain other customary conditions. If these closing conditions are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the Purchase Agreement or if the Purchase Agreement is terminated for any other reason other than as a result of our decision to pursue a competing transaction, we may not be able to achieve certain milestone events included in the Revised PSA, including the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s approval and completion of the sale of Nextel Mexico, confirmation of the Revised PSA and the occurrence of the effective date of the Revised Plan. If we fail to achieve any of these milestone events by the applicable date specified in the Revised PSA, the Revised PSA may be terminated and there can be no assurances that we will be able to reach a new plan support agreement or obtain creditor approval for a revised plan of reorganization to emerge from bankruptcy. Our failure to complete the sale of Nextel Mexico would also have an adverse impact on our liquidity requiring us to secure other sources of financing to support our business plan, which could also have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully develop and implement a plan of reorganization to emerge from bankruptcy.\n3.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may adversely affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting.\nAs described in Part II. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures included in this annual report on Form 10-K, we disclosed a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to an aggregation of control deficiencies in Brazil resulting from Nextel Brazil's failure to establish an effective control environment and monitoring activities, including an organizational structure with sufficiently trained resources where supervisory roles, responsibilities and monitoring activities are aligned with our financial reporting objectives. Further, Nextel Brazil did not maintain effective operation of process level controls, including reconciliation and management review controls. Our efforts to remediate these deficiencies are ongoing and include reassessing the organizational structure within Nextel Brazil, providing training on the Company's policies and procedures and the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting, including individuals' responsibilities, improving the documentation and operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and increasing the level of involvement and oversight from the corporate office until the organizational structure and financial reporting processes in Brazil have matured.\nOur inability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, as described above, combined with issues or delays in implementing the improvements described herein, could result in a material misstatement to our financial statements or other disclosures, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n4.\nDue to our Chapter 11 filing and recent results of operations, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nOver the course of the last several years, our results of operations, including our operating revenues and operating cash flows, have been negatively affected by a number of factors, including competitive pressure across all of our markets, the overall depreciation of the value of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, the impact of previous delays in the deployment and launch of services on our WCDMA networks, which combined with competitive conditions to slow the pace of subscriber growth and revenues on those networks, and the increased costs to support both of our networks. These and other factors had a significant negative impact on our results, and as a result, we ended 2014 with a significantly smaller subscriber and revenue base than was necessary to reach the scale required to generate positive operating income.\nThese conditions, and their impact on our liquidity, raise substantial doubt about our ability to fund our debt obligations when they become due, which in addition to our failure to satisfy certain financial covenants under our existing debt obligations, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For this purpose, we assume that a business is generally considered to be a going concern if there is neither the intention nor the need to liquidate or materially curtail the scope of its business plans.\na.\nWe may not be able to execute our business plan or meet our obligations.\nBased on our current cash and investment balances and forecasted payment obligations, it will be necessary for us to raise debtor-in-possession financing by the second quarter of 2015 to ensure we can continue to meet those obligations in the ordinary course of business. We plan to secure $350.0 million in bridge loan financing contemplated by the Revised PSA that would remain\noutstanding in order to provide us with the additional liquidity necessary to fund our business plan until the sale of Nextel Mexico is completed. We expect to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Nextel Mexico to repay this debtor-in-possession loan and support our business plan going forward.\nOur current circumstances, together with the restrictions in our current financing arrangements and/or general conditions in the financial and credit markets would be expected to make it difficult to obtain funding for our business either before or after we emerge from Chapter 11 pursuant to a confirmed plan of reorganization. If available, the cost of any funding could be both significant and higher than the cost of our existing financing arrangements. Moreover, the debtors' access to additional funding will be subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court while our Chapter 11 cases are pending, and we believe that our ability to secure significant additional funding, other than debtor-in-possession financing obtained while we are subject to the Chapter 11 proceedings, will not be available until we emerge from those proceedings. Our inability to obtain suitable financing when it is required for these or other reasons could, among other things, negatively impact our results of operations and liquidity and result in our inability to implement our current or future business plans.\nOur current business plan assumes that customers will find our services attractive and that we will be able to continue to expand our subscriber base on our WCDMA networks. Our business plan also assumes that we will increase our operating revenues and ultimately generate positive operating cash flows. However, given the factors that have negatively affected our business, the difficulties associated with predicting our ability to overcome these factors and the uncertainty regarding our ability to complete the proposed sale of Nextel Mexico and confirm a plan of reorganization that would allow us to successfully restructure our debt obligations and emerge from the Chapter 11 proceedings, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these results.\nb.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we were in violation of one or more of the financial covenants under some of our financing arrangements.\nThe negative impact of the factors discussed above on our results of operations also adversely affected our ability to comply with certain financial covenants in our existing debt obligations. Specifically, as of the June 30, 2014 measurement date, we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants in our equipment financing facilities in Brazil and Mexico. In December 2014, Nextel Brazil and Nextel Mexico and the lender under the equipment financing facilities agreed to amendments to those facilities that removed all financial covenants beginning with the December 31, 2014 measurement date and continuing through the June 30, 2017 measurement date. In addition, in February 2015, Nextel Brazil and the lenders providing the Brazil local bank loans entered into standstill agreements under which the lenders agreed that they would not seek remedies under the provisions of the agreements related to Nextel Brazil's failure to satisfy the financial covenants in the loan agreements in the period before September 15, 2015 and that further principal repayment obligations due between the signing date and September 15, 2015 would be suspended. In addition, the standstill agreements formally commit the lenders to sign amendments once certain conditions are met. Among others, these conditions include an effective date of our emergence from Chapter 11 on or prior to September 15, 2015. In the event of a breach of one or more of the conditions listed above, the lenders have the right to terminate the standstill agreement and exercise all remedies under the agreements in place, including but not limited to declaring an event of default for noncompliance with the financial covenants and/or nonpayment of amounts due under the repayment schedule. Following the declaration of an event of default, the lenders will have the right to accelerate the loans and proceed with claims against the collateral. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\n5.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has indicated that our financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nBased on our results of operations, including our operating revenues and operating cash flows, and the impact such results have had on our liquidity, in combination with the uncertainty surrounding our Chapter 11 filing and other factors, our independent registered public accounting firm has included a statement with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern in their report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014. See \u201c3. Due to our Chapter 11 filing and recent results of operations we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\" and \"- Business Update.\" However, our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The reaction of investors and others to the inclusion of a going concern statement by our auditors, our results of operations and questions regarding our potential inability to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations and may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to continue to execute our business plans, raise new capital and/or make our scheduled debt payments on a timely basis or at all.\n6.\nBecause our cash flows from operating activities are negative, and are expected to continue to be negative through 2015, we will likely need to meet our obligations and fund our working capital with cash on hand and proceeds from asset sales.\nOur cash flows from operating activities were negative in 2014, and based on our current plans, we expect our cash flows from operating activities to remain negative through 2015. Our current plans are based on a number of key assumptions relating to, among other things, our ability to attract and retain customers and build our subscriber and revenue base without significantly increasing our costs. If any of our assumptions are not borne out or are otherwise not correct, our cash flows from operations could be significantly lower than expected. As a result, our cash flows from operating activities could continue to be negative or our capital expenditures could exceed our cash flows from operations beyond 2015 and for an extended period of time. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in executing on our plans or that we will generate positive cash flows from operations or cash flows from operations sufficient to cover our capital expenditures in the future. See \u201c3. Due to our Chapter 11 filing and recent results of operations we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\u201d\nOur current business plan assumes that we will complete the proposed sale of Nextel Mexico, that customers will find our services attractive and that we will be able to continue to expand our subscriber base on our WCDMA network in Brazil. We also assume that we will be able to achieve a partial reversal of the subscriber loss trends we have experienced recently. However, given the factors that have negatively affected our business, the difficulties associated with predicting our ability to overcome these factors and the uncertainty regarding our ability to complete the Nextel Mexico sale and to confirm a plan of reorganization that would allow us to successfully restructure our debt obligations and emerge from the Chapter 11 proceedings, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these results. In addition, we need to pay cash taxes and fund our working capital.\nDue to the combined impact of the commencement of the Chapter 11 cases relating to NII Holdings, Inc. and certain of its non-operating subsidiaries, our recent and projected results of operations and other factors, our access to the capital markets is likely to be limited or nonexistent. The debtors' access to additional funding will also be subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court while they remain in Chapter 11 proceedings, and we believe that our ability to secure significant additional funding, other than any debtor-in-possession financing obtained while we are subject to the Chapter 11 proceedings that we would expect to repay with proceeds from the proposed sale of Nextel Mexico, will be conditioned upon our emergence from those proceedings pursuant to a confirmed plan of reorganization.\n7.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively in the highly competitive wireless communications industry, our future growth and operating results will suffer.\nOur business involves selling wireless communications services to subscribers, and as a result, our economic success is based on our ability to attract new subscribers and retain current subscribers. Our success will depend on the ability of our operating companies to compete effectively with other telecommunications services providers, including other wireless telecommunications companies, internet and cable service providers and providers of fixed wireline services, in the markets in which they operate. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the telecommunications industry in our markets, including the availability of new services, features and technologies; changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends and economic conditions; our ability to fund our operations; and our competitors' pricing strategies.\na.\nThe wireless industries in our markets are highly competitive, making it difficult for us to attract and retain customers. If we are unable to attract and retain customers, our financial performance will be impaired.\nCompetition among telecommunications service providers in our markets is intense as multiple carriers seek to attract and retain customers. Some of the factors contributing to this competitive environment include a higher relative penetration of wireless services in our markets compared to historic levels, which drives more aggressive competition as competitors seek to attract and retain customers that support the growth of their businesses in a more saturated market, the development and availability of new products and services, including services supported by new technologies, and the entry of new competitors. We also expect the current trend of alliances, cost-sharing arrangements and consolidation in the wireless and communications industries to continue as companies respond to the need for cost reduction and additional spectrum. This trend may result in the creation of larger and more efficient competitors with greater financial, technical, promotional and other resources to compete with our businesses. In addition, as we continue to pursue our plans to expand our marketing and sales focus to include a larger segment of high value consumers, we will be increasingly seeking to attract customers in segments that have historically been predominantly served by our competitors, many of which are larger companies with more extensive networks, financial resources and benefits of scale that allow them to spend more money on marketing and advertising than us and to exploit scale advantages that allow them to offer products and services at a lower cost.\nIn order to obtain a competitive advantage, our competitors have, among other things:\n\u2022\nprovided increased handset subsidies;\n\u2022\noffered higher commissions to distributors;\n\u2022\noffered a broader range of handsets and, in some cases, offered those handsets through exclusivity periods;\n\u2022\nprovided discounted or free airtime or other services;\n\u2022\nexpanded their networks to provide more extensive network coverage;\n\u2022\ndeveloped and deployed networks that use new technologies and support new or improved services;\n\u2022\noffered incentives to larger customers to switch service providers, including reimbursement of cancellation fees; and\n\u2022\noffered bundled telecommunications services that include local, long distance and data services.\nIn addition, number portability requirements, which enable customers to switch wireless providers without changing their wireless numbers, have been implemented in all of our markets, making it easier for wireless providers to effectively target and attract their competitors' customers.\nThe competitive environment in our markets and competitive strategies of our competitors will put pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and for handsets and other devices that we sell in connection with our service offerings. These developments and actions by our competitors could continue to negatively impact our operating results and our ability to attract and retain customers. These competitive conditions may also require that we incur increased costs such as higher sales commissions or handset subsidies as we add new customers, which may reduce our profitability even while customer growth continues. If we are unable to respond to competition and compensate for declining prices by adding new customers, increasing usage and offering new services, our revenues and profitability could continue to decline.\nb.\nCompetition and technological changes in the market for wireless services, including competition driven by our competitors' deployment of long-term evolution or other advanced technologies, could negatively affect our average revenue per subscriber, customer turnover, operating costs and our ability to attract new subscribers, resulting in adverse effects on our revenues, future cash flows, growth and profitability. If we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes or if we fail to deploy our WCDMA networks and offer new services on these networks in a manner that delivers a quality customer experience, we may not be able to attract and retain customers.\nThe wireless telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological change. Spending by our competitors on new wireless services and network improvements could enable them to obtain a competitive advantage with new technologies or enhancements that we do not offer. Rapid change in technology may lead to the development of wireless communications technologies that support products or services that consumers prefer over the products or services that we offer. If we are unable to keep pace with future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis, or at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to compete effectively and could lose subscribers to our competitors.\nWhile we have deployed or are in the process of deploying our WCDMA networks in our markets other than Argentina, they have yet to achieve wide acceptance, and competitors in each of our markets have launched new or upgraded networks that use technology similar to the WCDMA networks that we have deployed or are in the process of deploying and are designed to support services that use high speed data transmission capabilities, including internet access and video telephony, and some of those competitors have expended significant resources and made substantial investments to deploy upgrades to the technology used in their networks. Some of our competitors have also deployed or announced their plans to deploy new network technologies that could provide further enhancements to data speed and capacity in our markets, including services utilizing LTE technologies. These and other future technological advancements may enable competitors to offer features or services we cannot provide or exceed the quality of services we offer, thereby making our services less competitive. In addition, we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace in the near term, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could continue to be adversely affected. In particular, our push-to-talk services on our new WCDMA networks may not meet the continually changing demands of our customers and may no longer serve to differentiate our services in the future.\nIn Brazil and Argentina, our current 800 MHz spectrum holdings are largely contiguous, making it possible to use that spectrum to support future technologies, if certain technical, operational and regulatory requirements are met, including, for example, the availability of compatible network and subscriber equipment. In Mexico, our 800 MHz spectrum is either partially contiguous or non-contiguous. As a result, while it may be feasible to use a portion of the spectrum to support future technologies, it will be necessary to reconfigure the spectrum band to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum for it to be used to efficiently support those technologies. In Argentina, we do not hold rights to use additional spectrum in bands that would facilitate a transition\nto a new network technology, which could make it more difficult or impossible for us to deploy new and more competitive services in Argentina.\nc.\nSome of our competitors are financially stronger than we are, which may limit our ability to compete based on price.\nBecause of their size, scale and resources, some of our competitors may be able to offer services to subscribers at prices that are below the prices that our operating companies can offer for comparable services. Many of our competitors are well-established companies that have:\n\u2022\nsubstantially greater financial and marketing resources;\n\u2022\nlarger customer bases;\n\u2022\nlarger spectrum positions;\n\u2022\nhigher profitability and positive free cash flow;\n\u2022\nmore access to funding, lower leverage and lower cost of financing; and\n\u2022\nlarger service coverage areas than those of our operating companies.\nIf we cannot compete effectively based on the price of our service offerings and related cost structure, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nd.\nThe network and subscriber equipment we currently use and expect to use is more expensive than the equipment used by our competitors, which may limit our ability to compete.\nOur iDEN-based networks utilize a proprietary technology developed and designed by Motorola Solutions, and Motorola Mobility is the primary supplier for the network equipment and handsets we sell for use on our iDEN networks. In contrast, all of our competitors use infrastructure and customer equipment that are based on standard technologies like the global system for mobile communications standard, or GSM, and WCDMA, which are substantially more widely used technologies than iDEN, are available from a significant number of suppliers and are produced in much larger quantities for a worldwide base of customers. While we expect to capture cost benefits from our transition to WCDMA networks and services, our plans to continue to offer handsets that feature push-to-talk services, as well as our smaller size relative to our competitors, may result in the cost of our handsets being higher, particularly those that are designed specifically to support push-to-talk services, because they will not be produced in the same quantities as our competitors' more standardized WCDMA handsets. As a result, our competitors benefit from economies of scale and lower costs for handsets and infrastructure equipment than are available to us. The higher costs of our handsets and other equipment may make it more difficult for us to attract or retain customers, and may require us to absorb a comparatively larger cost of offering handsets to new and existing customers. The combination of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our growth and profitability.\nIn addition, the spectrum band that we use to support our WCDMA networks and services in Mexico is not as widely used throughout the world to support WCDMA networks as other spectrum bands that are being used by some of our competitors. Utilizing this type of spectrum band may have an adverse impact on the availability of certain types of handsets that our customers may desire and may increase the costs of the handsets we offer.\ne.\nOur operating companies may face disadvantages when competing against government-owned and formerly government-owned incumbent wireline operators or wireless operators affiliated with them.\nIn some markets, our operating companies compete against a government-owned telecommunications operator or a formerly government-owned telecommunications operator, some of which enjoy a near monopoly position relating to the provision of wireline telecommunications services and may have a wireless affiliate. For example, an affiliate of Telcel, which is our largest competitor in Mexico, is the incumbent provider of wireline services in Mexico and was formerly a government-owned monopoly. In Argentina, we expect to compete against ARSAT, which is a government-owned telecommunications operator. Our operating companies may be at a competitive disadvantage in these markets because former government-owned incumbents or affiliated competitors may have:\n\u2022\nclose ties with national regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncontrol over connections to local telephone lines; or\n\u2022\nthe ability to subsidize competitive services with revenues generated from services they provide on a monopoly or near-monopoly basis.\nFor example, the services that we provide on our new WCDMA networks require significantly greater data capacity than is the case on our iDEN networks, and this higher capacity demand have made it necessary for us to obtain wireline or other connecting\ncircuits between elements of our network such as switches and transmitter and receiver sites that are capable of transporting a significantly higher volume of data traffic. In some instances, the availability of those higher capacity circuits is limited and in many cases, our access to those circuits is controlled by entities that are affiliated with our competitors. As a result, we are dependent on entities that are affiliated with our competitors to provide us with the data transport services needed to support our networks and services. Our ability to offer services could be adversely affected if those entities were to choose to allocate limited transport capacity to other customers including their wireless affiliates or otherwise make it more difficult for us to obtain the necessary transport capacity to support our networks and services.\nOur operating companies may also encounter obstacles and setbacks if local governments adopt policies favoring these competitors or otherwise afford them preferential treatment. As a result, our operating companies may be at a competitive disadvantage to incumbent providers, particularly as our operating companies seek to offer new telecommunications services.\nf.\nOur coverage is not as extensive as those of other wireless service providers in our markets, which may limit our ability to attract and retain subscribers.\nIn recent years, we have deployed and will continue to expand and enhance our WCDMA networks, but our current networks do not offer nationwide coverage in the countries in which we operate nor will they provide the coverage available on some of our competitors' networks. Although we have entered into roaming agreements relating to our WCDMA services in Brazil and Mexico that allow our customers to use roaming services in a broader area in those markets, we are not able to supplement our iDEN network coverage using roaming arrangements because the uniqueness of our iDEN technology limits our potential roaming partners for subscribers solely on iDEN networks. In addition, the implementation of the roaming services that support our WCDMA services are subject to the risks described below, and the costs of such services may be uneconomical, particularly if the competitive environment continues to put pressure on the prices we are able to charge for services provided to our customers. As a result, we will not be able to utilize roaming arrangements to extend the coverage of our iDEN networks and may not be able to economically extend the coverage of our WCDMA networks using our existing or future roaming arrangements, making it difficult for us to provide geographic coverage for our services that is sufficient to attract and retain certain subscribers and compete effectively with competitors that operate mobile networks with more extensive service areas.\nWe have entered into roaming arrangements with respect to services supported by our WCDMA networks in Brazil and Mexico that enable our customers in Brazil and Mexico to roam within those markets in areas where we do not offer network coverage. There is no guarantee we will be able to effectively implement or maintain these agreements to provide roaming service in areas where we do not have network coverage or that the terms of those agreements will allow us to utilize roaming services to economically extend our coverage areas. In addition, we have entered into agreements with wireless carriers in a number of countries that allow customers whose service is supported by our WCDMA networks to utilize roaming services in those countries. Both in-market and international roaming requires our customers to rely on networks that are owned and operated by third parties and, in the case of in-market roaming, by our competitors. We are unable to ensure the availability of services or data speeds on these networks, and in most cases, push-to-talk service, one of our key differentiators, will not be available or will not have the same level of performance when our subscribers are roaming, which could negatively affect the service experience of our customers and ultimately make it more difficult to retain these subscribers.\ng.\nIf there is a substantial increase in our customer turnover rate, our business could be negatively affected.\nIn recent years, we have experienced a higher consolidated customer turnover rate compared to earlier periods, which resulted primarily from the combined impact of weaker economic conditions, more competitive sales environments in the markets in which we operate and our offering of prepaid and hybrid services to customers who are more likely to change service providers.\nIn addition, we have broadened our target market to include customers that have typically demonstrated a willingness to change service providers more frequently and have increased our usage of prepaid and hybrid post and prepaid payment terms as part of our service plans in order to attract more price sensitive customers, both of which had an adverse impact on our consolidated customer turnover rate. These and other changes in our marketing strategies and the types of customers we target have recently had a negative impact on our consolidated customer turnover rate and could continue to have that impact in the future. Subscriber losses adversely affect our business and results of operations because these losses result in lost revenues and cash flow, drive higher bad debt expenses and require us to attract replacement customers and incur the related sales commissions and other costs. Although attracting new subscribers and retaining existing subscribers are both important to the financial viability of our business, there is an added focus on retaining existing subscribers because the cost of acquiring a new subscriber is much higher. Accordingly, increased levels of subscriber deactivations have had and could continue to have a negative impact on our results, even if we are able to attract new subscribers at a rate sufficient to offset those deactivations. If we experience further increases in our customer turnover rate, or if the higher customer turnover rates we are currently experiencing do not decline to levels that are closer to what we have historically experienced, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nh.\nIf our networks do not perform in a manner that meets subscriber expectations, we will be unable to attract and retain customers.\nCustomer acceptance of the services we offer on our networks is and will continue to be affected by technology-based differences and by the operational performance and reliability of these networks. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining customers if: we are unable to satisfactorily address and resolve performance or other transmission quality issues as they arise; these issues limit our ability to deploy or expand our network capacity as currently planned; or these issues place us at a competitive disadvantage to other wireless providers in our markets. In Mexico, our subscriber base, operating revenues and operating cash flows were negatively impacted by Sprint's decision to deactivate its iDEN network in the U.S. in mid-2013 and our failure to effectively deploy and optimize our WCDMA network to meet the needs of customers who were seeking new services to replace their iDEN services, particularly customers living in areas near the border of Mexico and the U.S. These factors contributed to the negative market perception of our brand and services provided using our WCDMA network that developed in Mexico in late 2013, and our competitors in Mexico used this negative perception as an opportunity to aggressively target our existing and potential subscribers, making it difficult for us to attract and retain subscribers and resulting in a significant decline in our subscriber base from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014.\ni.\nCustomer concerns about our financial condition, ability to continue as a going concern and ability to implement our business plan, including our network development and deployment efforts, may have an additional adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain customers.\nWe believe that our customers may take our medium- to long-term operating and financial outlook, particularly to the extent that it is perceived to impact our network deployment and development, into account when deciding whether to continue or begin service with us. Recently, our results of operations, including our operating revenues and operating cash flows, have been negatively affected by a number of factors. See \u201c3. Due to our Chapter 11 filing and recent results of operations, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\u201d If customers or potential customers who are aware of our recent results of operations, or of current and future adjustments to our business plan in response to those results, become concerned that we will be unable to continue to provide service to them at a quality level that meets their needs, customer deactivations could increase and new subscribers could decrease relative to our business plans. Our current business plan assumes that customers will find our services attractive and that we will be able to increase our subscriber base. However, given the factors that have negatively affected our business and the difficulties associated with predicting our ability to overcome these factors, there can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove to be correct. Increases in customer deactivations and decreases in new subscribers relative to our business plan would adversely affect our revenues and our ability to generate the cash needed to fund our business and meet our other obligations.\n8.\nIf we are not able to manage our future growth, our operating results will suffer.\nOur ability to achieve our long-range business goals and to grow profitably is dependent on our ability to manage changes to our business model and cost structure that are necessary to allow us to pursue our plans to expand both our service offerings and our targeted customer segments, including by implementing new and more efficient supporting business systems and processes. Our inability to complete these efforts in a timely fashion, or to manage the related costs, could have an adverse impact on our business.\na.\nWe may be limited in our ability to grow unless we successfully expand network capacity and launch competitive services.\nTo continue to successfully retain our existing customers, increase our customer base and pursue our business plan, we must economically:\n\u2022\nexpand the capacity and coverage of our WCDMA networks;\n\u2022\nsecure sufficient transmitter and receiver sites at appropriate locations to meet planned system coverage and capacity targets;\n\u2022\nobtain adequate quantities of base radios and other system infrastructure equipment; and\n\u2022\nobtain an adequate volume and mix of handsets to meet customer demand.\nIn particular, the deployment and expansion of the coverage and capacity of our WCDMA networks will require us to deploy a significant number of new transmitter and receiver sites in order to meet the expanded coverage and capacity requirements for those networks resulting from differences in our commercial strategies, differences in the propagation characteristics of the spectrum bands being used to support those networks and the coverage requirements associated with the spectrum licenses being utilized for those networks. In some of our markets, individuals and governments are opposing new tower construction and supporting laws restricting the construction of towers and other transmitter and receiver sites. Compliance with such laws could increase the time and costs associated with our planned network deployments. The effort required to locate and build a significant number of\nadditional transmitter sites across our markets in coming years will be substantial, and our failure to meet this demand could delay or impair the expansion of our WCDMA networks, which would adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, as we launch a broader array of services on our WCDMA networks, we must develop, test and deploy new supporting technologies, software applications and systems intended to enhance our competitiveness both by supporting existing and new services and features, and by reducing the costs associated with providing those services. Successful deployment and implementation of new services and technology on our WCDMA networks depend, in part, on the willingness and ability of third parties to develop new handsets and applications that are attractive to our customers and that are available in a timely manner. We may not be able to successfully expand our WCDMA networks as needed or complete the development and deployment of competitive services using our new networks. Failure to successfully expand those networks and services could also be expected to result in subscriber dissatisfaction that could affect our ability to retain subscribers and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth prospects. If this occurs, we may be unable to recover the substantial investment we are making in our new networks and the related costs we incur to offer these new services.\nb.\nFailure to successfully implement core information technology and operating systems may adversely affect our business operations.\nOur business strategy envisions growing our business by successfully building and deploying our WCDMA networks, expanding our product and service offerings and expanding our target customer base. Even if we do expand our business, if we fail to manage our growth effectively, our financial results could be adversely affected. Separately, growth may place a strain on our management systems and resources. We must continue to refine and expand our business development and sales capabilities, our network operations and information technology infrastructure, and the hardware, software, systems, processes and people to effectively support current and future sales, customer service and information requirements of our business in an efficient and cost-effective manner. In addition, failure to prioritize technology initiatives and effectively allocate resources in order to achieve our strategic goals could result in a failure to realize those goals, including the expected benefits of our growth, and could negatively affect our financial results.\nChanges to our networks and business strategies require us to implement new operating and supporting systems to improve our ability to address the needs of our customers, as well as to create additional efficiencies and strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting. We may not be able to successfully implement these new systems in an effective or timely manner or we could fail to complete all necessary data reconciliation or other conversion controls when implementing the new systems. In addition, we may incur significant increases in costs and encounter extensive delays in the implementation and rollout of these new systems. Failure to effectively implement our new operating systems may adversely affect our results of operations, customer perceptions and internal controls over financial reporting.\nAs we grow, we must continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. We cannot assure you that we will be able to allocate our human resources optimally or identify and hire qualified employees or retain valued employees. If we are unable to manage our growth and operations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nc.\nCosts, regulatory requirements and other problems we encounter as we deploy our WCDMA networks could adversely affect our operations.\nIn some instances, the rights to use the spectrum that supports our WCDMA networks come with significant regulatory requirements governing the coverage of these networks, the timing of deployment of these networks and the loading of new customers on these networks. If we fail to meet these regulatory requirements, the applicable regulators could assess fines and, in some instances, take action to revoke our spectrum rights.[In addition, our deployment of these new networks will require significant capital expenditures and will result in incremental operating expenses prior to fully launching services. Costs could increase beyond expected levels as a result of unforeseen delays, cost overruns, unanticipated expenses, regulatory changes, engineering design changes, problems with network or systems compatibility, equipment unavailability and technological or other complications.\nIn addition, regulators could require us to provide competitors with the ability to interconnect with our push-to-talk services and, accordingly, gain access to our push-to-talk customers in the future. This access could dilute the competitive advantage and negatively affect the quality of this key differentiator, which could affect the willingness of current customers to remain on our network and negatively impact the willingness of potential customers to choose our service.\n9.\nLaws restricting the exchange of currencies or expatriating funds limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make funds available to us.\nBecause almost all of our business operations and assets are conducted and held by our foreign subsidiaries, we depend on those subsidiaries to provide us with cash to satisfy our obligations whether in the form of advances from our subsidiaries, the repayment by our subsidiaries of intercompany loans or the payment of dividends and other distributions from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries. Laws or regulations restricting the exchange of currencies or expatriation of funds limit the ability of these subsidiaries to distribute cash or assets. For example, in Argentina, the Argentine Central Bank has\nimplemented certain formal and informal requirements related to the acquisition of foreign currency by Argentine and non-Argentine residents and on the inflow and outflow of capital to and from Argentina, including those for the purposes of repayment of principal and interest, dividend payments and repatriation of capital. From time to time, the Argentine Central Bank and other authorities in Argentina have used these formal and informal requirements to limit the convertibility of currency and our ability to repatriate capital from Nextel Argentina to its parent companies. Due to these restrictions, cash and investments held by Nextel Argentina are not available to our holding company or our subsidiaries located outside of Argentina. Brazilian law provides that the Brazilian government may, for a limited period of time, impose restrictions on the remittance by Brazilian companies to foreign investors of the proceeds of investments in Brazil. These restrictions may be imposed whenever there is a material imbalance or a serious risk of a material imbalance in Brazil's balance of payments. The inability to receive sufficient cash from our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets to meet those obligations. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such financing or sell assets at acceptable terms or at all and, under such circumstances, our failure to do so could prevent us from satisfying our obligations and from maintaining cash for dividends.\n10.\nWe operate exclusively in foreign markets, and our assets, subscribers and cash flows are concentrated in Latin America, which presents risks to our operating plans. These risks will become more concentrated in Brazil if we complete the sale of Nextel Mexico.\nAs a holding company with operations concentrated in Latin America, our growth and operating results are dependent on the strength and stability of the economic, political and regulatory environments in which we operate. If we successfully complete the proposed sale of Nextel Mexico, as discussed in \"Item 1. Business - Business Update,\" the risks associated with operating exclusively in foreign markets will relate primarily to the events and conditions in Brazil, and changes in the economic, political and regulatory environment or foreign currency exchange rates in Brazil will have a more significant impact on our operating results than has been the case historically with operations in multiple Latin American markets. As a result, our business and operations may be subject to a higher degree of risk and volatility due to the impact of the risks described below.\na.\nA decline in foreign exchange rates for currencies in our markets may adversely affect our growth and our operating results.\nHistorically, in the countries in which we do business, the values of the local currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar have been volatile. The unstable global economic environment and recent weakness in the economies of some of the countries where we operate has led to increased volatility in these currencies. Nearly all of our revenues are earned in non-U.S. currencies, but we report our results in U.S. dollars. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and can have a significant impact on our reported results that may not reflect the operating trends in our business. In addition, almost 50% of our outstanding debt that has not been classified as subject to compromise is denominated in U.S. dollars. A decline in the values of the local currencies in the markets in which we operate makes it more costly for us to service our U.S. dollar-denominated debt obligations and affects our operating results because we generate nearly all of our revenues in foreign currencies, but we pay for some of our operating expenses and capital expenditures in U.S. dollars. Further, because we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, declines in the value of local currencies in our markets relative to the U.S. dollar result in reductions in our reported revenues, as well as a reduction in the carrying value of our assets, including the value of cash investments held in local currencies. Depreciation of the local currencies also results in increased costs to us for imported equipment. We have entered into some limited hedging arrangements to mitigate short-term volatility in foreign exchange rates, but have not hedged against long-term movements in foreign exchange rates because the alternatives currently available for hedging against those movements are limited and costly. As a result, if the values of local currencies in the countries in which our operating companies conduct business depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar, we would expect our reported operating results in future periods, and the value of our assets held in local currencies, to be adversely affected.\nb.\nWe face economic and political risks in our markets, which may limit our ability to implement our strategy and could negatively impact our financial flexibility, including our ability to repatriate and redeploy profits, and may disrupt our operations or hurt our performance.\nOur operations depend on the economies of the markets in which our operating companies conduct business, all of which are considered to be emerging markets. These markets are in countries with economies in various stages of development, some of which are subject to volatile economic cycles and significant, rapid fluctuations in terms of commodity prices, local consumer prices, employment levels, gross domestic product, interest rates and inflation rates, which have been generally higher, and at times, significantly higher than the inflation rate in the U.S. If these economic fluctuations and higher inflation rates make it more difficult for customers to pay for our products and services, we may experience lower demand for our products and services and a decline in the growth of their customer base and in revenues. In addition, in recent years, the economies in some of the markets in which we operate have also been negatively affected by volatile political conditions and, in some instances, by significant intervention by the relevant government authorities relating to economic and currency exchange policies. For more information, see \"9. Laws restricting the exchange of currencies or expatriating funds limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make funds available\nto us.\" Limitations on our ability to convert currency and repatriate and redeploy capital may prevent us from managing our business and financial obligations in a cost effective manner, compete effectively, take advantage of new business opportunities and grow our business.\nWe are unable to predict the impact that local or national elections and the associated transfer of power from incumbent officials or political parties to newly elected officials or parties may have on the local economy or the growth and development of the local telecommunications industry. Changes in leadership or in the ruling party in the countries in which we operate may affect the economic programs developed under the prior administration, which in turn, may adversely affect the economies in the countries in which we operate. Other risks associated with political instability could include the risk of expropriation or nationalization of our assets by the governments in the markets where we operate. Although political, economic and social conditions differ in each country in which we currently operate, political and economic developments in one country or in the U.S. may affect our business as a whole, including our access to international capital markets to obtain funding needed for our business or to refinance our existing indebtedness.\nc.\nOur operating companies are subject to local laws and government regulations in the countries in which they operate, and we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which could limit our growth and strategic plans and negatively impact our financial results.\nOur operations are subject to local laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, which may differ substantially from those in the U.S., and we could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with those local laws and regulations. In some foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, persons may engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business. Our employees and agents interact with government officials on our behalf, including interactions necessary to obtain licenses and other regulatory approvals necessary to operate our business and through contracts to provide wireless service to government entities, creating a risk that actions may occur that could violate the FCPA. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations as well as U.S. laws and regulations, including the FCPA, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, contractors and agents will abide by our policies. The penalties for violating the FCPA can be severe. Any violations of law, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, in each market in which we operate, one or more regulatory entities regulate the licensing, construction, acquisition, ownership and operation of our wireless communications systems. Adoption of new regulations, changes in the current telecommunications laws or regulations or changes in the manner in which they are interpreted or applied could adversely affect our operations by increasing our costs, reducing our revenues or making it more difficult for us to compete.\nThe regulatory schemes in the countries in which we operate allow third parties, including our competitors, to challenge our actions or decisions of the regulators in our markets that potentially benefit us such as decisions regarding the allocation and licensing of spectrum. If our competitors are successful in pursuing claims such as these, or if the regulators in our markets take actions against us in response to actions initiated by our competitors, our ability to pursue our business plans and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFinally, rules and regulations affecting placement and construction of our transmitter and receiver sites affect our ability to deploy and operate our networks in each of our markets, and therefore impact our business strategies. In some of our markets, local governments have adopted very stringent rules and regulations related to the placement and construction of wireless towers, or have placed embargoes on some of the cell sites owned by our operating companies, which can significantly impede the planned expansion of our service coverage area or require us to remove or modify existing towers, which can result in unplanned costs, negatively impact network performance and impose new and onerous taxes and fees. Compliance with such laws, rules and regulations could increase the time and costs associated with our planned network deployments. The propagation characteristics of the spectrum bands being used to support our WCDMA networks and the coverage requirements associated with the spectrum licenses being utilized for those networks, particularly in Brazil, will require substantially more transmitter and receiver sites to meet the minimum coverage requirements of those licenses and to provide coverage to the areas needed to provide competitive services. In addition, our licenses to use spectrum in some of our markets require us to build our networks within proscribed time periods, and rules and regulations affecting tower placement and construction could make it difficult to meet our build requirements in a timely manner or at all, which could lead us to incur unplanned costs or result in the loss of spectrum licenses.\nd.\nWe pay significant import duties on our network equipment and handsets, and any increases could impact our financial results.\nOur operations are highly dependent upon the successful and cost-efficient importation of network equipment and handsets and other devices from locations outside the countries in which we operate. Network equipment and handsets may be subject to\nsignificant import duties and other taxes in the countries in which our operating companies conduct business. Any significant increase in import duties in the future could significantly increase our costs. To the extent we cannot pass these costs on to our customers, our financial results will be negatively impacted.\ne.\nWe are subject to foreign taxes in the countries in which we operate, which may reduce amounts we receive from our operating companies or may increase our tax costs.\nMany of the foreign countries in which we operate have increasingly turned to new taxes, as well as aggressive interpretations of current tax law, as a method of increasing revenue. For example, our operating company in Brazil is required to pay two types of income taxes, which include a corporate income tax and a social contribution tax and is subject to various types of non-income related taxes, including value-added tax, excise tax, service tax, importation tax and property tax. In addition, the reduction in tax revenues resulting from the economic downturn that has occurred in the last several years has led to proposals and new laws in some of our markets that increase the taxes imposed on sales of handsets and on telecommunications services. The provisions of new tax laws may attempt to prohibit us from passing these taxes on to our customers or our ability to do so may be limited by competitive conditions. These taxes may reduce the amount of earnings that we can generate from our services or in some cases may result in operating losses.\nDistributions of earnings and other payments, including interest, received from our operating companies may be subject to withholding taxes imposed by some countries in which these entities operate. Any of these taxes will reduce the amount of after-tax cash we can receive from those operating companies.\nIn general, a U.S. corporation may claim a foreign tax credit against its federal income tax expense for foreign withholding taxes and, under certain circumstances, for its share of foreign income taxes paid directly by foreign corporate entities in which the company owns 10% or more of the voting stock. Our ability to claim foreign tax credits is, however, subject to numerous limitations, and we may incur incremental tax costs as a result of these limitations or because we do not have U.S. Federal taxable income.\nWe may also be required to include in our income for U.S. federal income tax purposes our proportionate share of specified earnings of our foreign corporate subsidiaries that are classified as controlled foreign corporations, without regard to whether distributions have been actually received from these subsidiaries.\nf.\nWe have entered into a number of agreements that are subject to enforcement in foreign countries, which may limit efficient dispute resolution.\nA number of the agreements that we and our operating companies enter into with third parties are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of or through arbitration proceedings in, the countries or regions in which the operations are located. We cannot accurately predict whether these forums will provide effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. Even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis. Our ability to obtain or enforce relief in the U.S. is also uncertain.\n11.\nThe costs we incur to connect our operating companies\u2019 networks with those of other carriers are subject to local laws in the countries in which they operate and may increase, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur operating companies must connect their telecommunication networks with those of other carriers in order to provide the services we offer. We incur costs relating to these interconnection arrangements and for local, long distance and data transport services relating to the connection of our transmitter sites and other network equipment. These costs include interconnection charges and fees, charges for terminating calls on the other carriers\u2019 networks and transport costs, most of which are measured based on the level of our use of the related services. We are able to recover a portion of these costs through revenues earned from charges we are entitled to bill other carriers for terminating calls on our network, but because users of mobile telecommunications services who purchase those services under contract generally, and business customers like ours in particular, tend to make more calls that terminate on other carriers\u2019 networks and because we have a smaller number of customers than most other carriers, we incur more charges than we are entitled to receive under these arrangements. The terms of the interconnection and transport arrangements, including the rates that we pay, are subject to varying degrees of local regulation in most of the countries in which we operate, and often require us to negotiate agreements with the other carriers, most of whom are our competitors, in order to provide our services. In some instances, other carriers offer their services to some of their subscribers at prices that are near or lower than the rates that we pay to terminate calls on their networks, which may make it more difficult for us to compete profitably. Our costs relating to these interconnection and transport arrangements are subject to fluctuation both as a result of changes in regulations in the countries in which we operate and the negotiations with the other carriers. Changes in our customers\u2019 calling patterns that result in more of our customers\u2019 calls terminating on our competitors\u2019 networks and changes in the interconnection arrangements either as a result of regulatory changes or negotiated terms that are less favorable to us could result in increased\ncosts for the related services that we may not be able to recover through increased revenues, which could adversely impact our financial results.\n12.\nBecause we rely on one supplier for equipment used in our iDEN networks, any failure of that supplier to perform could adversely affect our operations.\nSome of the spectrum that our operating companies are licensed to use, other than the spectrum that supports our WCDMA networks, is non-contiguous, and the iDEN technology is the only commercially available technology that operates on non-contiguous spectrum. As a result, Motorola Solutions is the primary supplier for the network equipment and Motorola Mobility, which is currently owned by Lenovo Group, is the primary supplier of the handsets we sell for use on our iDEN networks. If either Motorola Solutions or Motorola Mobility fails to deliver system infrastructure equipment and handsets or enhancements to the features and functionality of our iDEN-based networks and handsets on a timely, cost-effective basis, we may not be able to adequately service our existing customers or attract new customers to services supported by our iDEN networks, particularly in Argentina where we do not currently hold rights to use spectrum that would support the deployment of a WCDMA-based network. Accordingly, if Motorola Solutions is unable to, or determines not to, continue supporting our iDEN-based infrastructure or if Motorola Mobility is unable to, or determines not to, continue to manufacture iDEN-based handsets, our business in Argentina will be materially adversely affected.\n13.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by our reliance on indirect distribution channels for a significant portion of our sales.\nOur business depends heavily upon third party distribution channels for securing a substantial portion of the new customers to our services, and with the expansion of our target market, we expect to rely more heavily on retailers and other sales channels for a growing portion of our sales. In many instances, we rely on these third party dealers and retailers to serve as the primary contact between us and the customer and to interact with other third parties on our behalf. As a result, there may be risks associated with the actions taken by our distributors or the operators of our other retail channels, including potential risks associated with the failure of our distributors or other retail channels to follow regulatory requirements. The volume of our new customer additions, our ability to retain customers and our profitability could also be adversely affected if these third party dealers or retailers terminate their relationship with us, if there are adverse changes in our relationships with them, if we alter our compensation arrangements with these dealers or retailers or if the financial condition of these dealers or retailers deteriorates.\n14.\nIf our licenses to provide mobile services are not renewed, or are modified or revoked, our business may be restricted.\nWireless communications licenses and spectrum allocations are subject to ongoing review and, in some cases, to modification or early termination for failure to comply with applicable regulations. If our operating companies fail to comply with the terms of their licenses and other regulatory requirements, including installation deadlines and minimum loading or service availability requirements, their licenses could be revoked. This is particularly true with respect to the grants of licenses for spectrum we use to support our WCDMA networks, most of which impose strict deadlines for the construction of network infrastructure and supporting systems as a condition of the license. Further, compliance with these requirements is a condition for eligibility for license renewal. Most of our wireless communications licenses have fixed terms and are not renewed automatically. Because governmental authorities have discretion to grant or renew licenses, our licenses may not be renewed or, if renewed, renewal may not be on acceptable economic terms. In addition, the regulatory schemes in the countries in which we operate allow third parties, including our competitors, to challenge the award and use of our licenses. If our competitors are successful in pursuing claims such as these, or if regulators in our markets take actions modifying or revoking our licenses in response to these claims, our ability to pursue our business plans, including our plans to deploy WCDMA networks, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n15.\nAny modification or termination of our trademark license with Nextel Communications could increase our costs.\nNextel Communications has licensed to us the right to use \u201cNextel\u201d and other of its trademarks on a perpetual basis in Latin America. However, Nextel Communications may terminate the license on 60 days notice if we commit one of several specified defaults (namely, unauthorized use, failure to maintain agreed quality controls or a change in control of NII Holdings). If there is a change in control of one of our subsidiaries, upon 90 days notice, Nextel Communications may terminate the sublicense granted by us to the subsidiary with respect to the licensed marks. The loss of the use of the \u201cNextel\u201d name and trademark could require us to incur significant costs to establish a new brand in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n16.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats and other material disruptions of our wireless networks.\nMajor equipment failures and the disruption of our wireless networks as a result of natural disasters, severe weather, terrorist attacks, acts of war, cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses, result in a loss of subscribers or impair our ability to attract new subscribers, which in\nturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the past, more stringent network performance standards and reporting obligations have been adopted by the governments in some of our markets in order to ensure quality of service during unforeseen disturbances. We could be required to make significant investments in our existing networks in order to comply with these types of network performance standards. In addition, while we maintain information security policies and procedures designed to comply with relevant privacy and security laws and restrictions, if we suffer a security breach of customer or employee confidential data, we may be subject to significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and loss of confidence in the security of our products and services.", "PERMNO": 89685, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "NIHD"}
