{"cik": "1699039", "company": "Ranger Energy Services, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the information in this Annual Report, including the matters addressed under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the following risks before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occur, the trading price of our Class A Common Stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also materially affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nOur operations are subject to inherent risks, some of which are beyond our control. These risks may be self-insured, or may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, blowouts, explosions, craterings, fires, oil spills and releases of drilling, completion or fracturing fluids or hazardous materials into the environment. These conditions can cause:\n\u2022disruption or suspension of operations;\n\u2022substantial repair or replacement costs;\n\u2022personal injury or loss of human life;\n\u2022significant damage to or destruction of property and equipment;\n\u2022environmental pollution, including groundwater contamination;\n\u2022unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures and industrial accidents; and\n\u2022substantial revenue loss.\nIn addition, our operations are subject to, and exposed to, employee/employer liabilities and risks such as wrongful termination, discrimination, labor organizing, retaliation claims and general human resource-related matters.\nThe occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and may increase our costs. Claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the well services industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are being used may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. Similarly, our operations involve the storage, handling and use of explosives. Accidents resulting from the use of explosives in our operations could expose us to reputational risks and liability for damages or otherwise adversely impact our operations or the operations of our customers. Any such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe do not have insurance against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against or the failure of an insurer to meet its insurance obligations could result in substantial losses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, it may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could rise significantly in the future so as to make such insurance prohibitively expensive.\nSeasonal weather conditions and natural disasters could severely disrupt normal operations and harm our business.\nOur operations are located in different regions of the United States. Some of these areas, including the Denver-Julesburg Basin and the Bakken Shale, are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions. During periods of heavy snow, ice, wind or rain, we may be unable to move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues, or we could suffer weather-related damage to our facilities and equipment, resulting in delays in operations. The exploration activities of our customers may also be affected during such periods of adverse weather conditions. Additionally, extended drought conditions in our operating regions could impact our ability or our customers\u2019 ability to source sufficient water or increase the cost for such water. As a result, a natural disaster or inclement\nweather conditions could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, climate change may result in various physical risks, such as the increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events or changes in meteorological and hydrological patterns, that could adversely impact us, our customers\u2019, and our suppliers\u2019 operations. Such physical risks may result in damage to our customers\u2019 facilities or otherwise adversely impact our operations, such as if facilities are subject to water use curtailments in response to drought, or demand for our customers\u2019 products, such as to the extent warmer winters reduce the demand for energy for heating purposes, which may ultimately reduce demand for the products and services we provide. Such physical risks may also impact our suppliers, which may adversely affect our ability to provide our products and services. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured.\nA terrorist attack, armed conflict or civil unrest could harm our business.\nThe occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries, including continued hostilities in the Middle East or domestic civil unrest, may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. For example, on February 24, 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine that has led to significant armed hostilities. As a result, the United States, the United Kingdom, the member states of the European Union and other public and private actors have levied severe sanctions on Russia. The geopolitical and macroeconomic consequences of this invasion and associated sanctions cannot be predicted, and such events, or any further hostilities in Ukraine or elsewhere, could severely impact the world economy. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas-related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers\u2019 operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and its potential adverse effect on business operations and financial condition.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 spread across the globe and was declared a public health emergency by the WHO and a National Emergency by the President of the United States in March of 2020. Significant progress has been made to combat COVID-19 and its multiple variants, however, it remains a global challenge and continues to have an impact on our financial results. The extent of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company\u2019s operational and financial performance will significantly depend on further developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and continued impact on our personnel, customer activity and third-party providers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted, and is likely to continue to result, in significant economic disruption and has, and will likely continue to, adversely affect the operations of the Company\u2019s business, as the significantly reduced global and national economic activity has resulted in reduced demand for oil and natural gas and an oversupply of crude oil. The direct impact to the Company\u2019s operations began to take affect at the close of the first quarter ended March 31, 2020, and have continued through the year ended December 31, 2021, however, the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact, newly discovered strains of the virus and uncertainty surrounding the vaccine supplies and implementation. At the time of this filing, cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. remain high, particularly in Texas, where we conduct significant operations.\nIndustry Conditions and Competition\nOur business depends on domestic capital spending by the oil and natural gas industry, and reductions in such capital spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business is directly affected by our customers\u2019 capital spending to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices that began in mid-2014 has caused a reduction in the exploration, development and production activities of most of our customers and their spending on our services. These cuts in spending have curtailed drilling programs, which resulted in a reduction in the demand for our services as compared to activity levels in early 2014, as well as in the prices we can charge. In addition, certain of our customers could become unable to pay their vendors and service providers, including us, as a result of the decline in commodity prices. Reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves in our areas of operation as a result of decreased capital spending may also have a negative long-term impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices, to the extent the\nreduced number of wells that need our services or equipment more than offsets new drilling and completion activity and complexity. Any of these conditions or events could adversely affect our operating results. If the recent recovery does not continue or our customers fail to further increase their capital spending, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIndustry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022domestic and foreign economic conditions and supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the level and cost of global and domestic oil and natural gas exploration, production, transportation of reserves and delivery;\n\u2022taxes and governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022political and economic conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022actions by the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other countries, such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, with respect to oil production levels and announcements of potential changes in such levels, including the failure of such countries to comply with production cuts;\n\u2022sanctions and other restrictions placed on oil producing countries, such as Iran and Venezuela;\n\u2022global weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022worldwide political, military and economic conditions;\n\u2022the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022shareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022uncertainty in capital and commodities markets.\nThe volatility of oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the demand for our services and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe demand for our services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related levels of capital spending and drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility, or the perception that oil or natural gas prices will decrease, affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells. This could lead to decreased demand for our services and lower utilization of our assets. We have, and may in the future, experience significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of the reactions of our customers to changes in oil and natural gas prices.\nPrices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the posted West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) price for oil has ranged from a low of negative $37 per Barrel (\u201cBbl\u201d) in April 2020. This negative pricing resulted from the holders of expiring front month oil purchase contracts being unable or unwilling to take physical delivery of crude oil and accordingly forced to make payments to purchasers of such contracts in order to transfer the corresponding purchase obligations. During the second half of 2020, there was a partial recovery as the closing price of oil reached $49 per Bbl in December 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the lowest price for oil was $47 per Bbl in January 2021, however increased significantly with the closing price of oil reaching a high of $85 per Bbl in October 2021.\nIn May 2020, the Texas Railroad Commission decided against imposing oil production cuts, however, waived fees related to new crude oil storage projects. Several other state agencies have made similar decisions. We cannot predict whether any of these activities will reduce the global supply and demand imbalance or whether or when oil and natural gas production and economic activities will return to normalized levels. In the absence of additional reductions to global production, oil, natural gas and NGLs prices could remain at current levels, or decline further, for an extended period of time, which will adversely impact the demand for our services. If the prices of oil and natural gas continue to be volatile, reverse their recent\nincreases or decline, our operations, financial condition, cash flows and level of expenditures may be materially and adversely affected.\nFuel conservation measures could reduce demand for oil and natural gas which would in turn reduce the demand for our services.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas products could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, and biofuels) could reduce demand for hydrocarbons and therefore for our services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues.\nWe may incur significant capital expenditures for new equipment as we grow our operations and may be required to incur further capital expenditures as a result of advancements in oilfield services technologies.\nAs we grow our operations we may be required to incur significant capital expenditures to build, acquire, update or replace our existing fixed assets and other equipment. Such demands on our capital and the increase in cost of labor necessary to operate such assets and other equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and may increase our costs. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have less equipment available for service or our equipment may not be attractive to current or potential customers.\nIn addition, because the oilfield services industry is characterized by significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage as competitors and others use or develop new technologies or technologies comparable to ours in the future. Further, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do, which may allow them to gain technological advantages or implement new technologies before we can. Additionally, we may be unable to implement new technologies or services at all, on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost.\nIn addition to technological advancements by our competitors, new technology could also make it easier for our customers to vertically integrate their operations or otherwise conduct their activities without the need for our equipment and services, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for our services. For example, if further advancements in drilling and completion techniques cause our E&P customers to require well service rigs with different or higher specifications than those in our existing and expected future fleet, or to otherwise require well service equipment that we do not currently own or operate, we may be required to incur significant additional capital expenditures to obtain any such new rigs or other equipment in an effort to meet customer demand. Limits on our ability to effectively obtain, use, implement or integrate new technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowth in accordance with our business plan, if achieved, could place a significant strain on our financial, operational and management resources. As we expand the scope of our activities and our geographic coverage through both organic growth and acquisitions, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers, engineers and other professionals in the oilfield services industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and our ability to successfully or timely execute our business plan.\nWe face intense competition that may cause us to lose market share and could negatively affect our ability to market our services and expand our operations.\nThe oilfield services business is highly competitive and fragmented. Some of our competitors are small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, while others have a broader geographic scope, greater financial and other resources, or other cost efficiencies. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements. Additionally, there may be new companies that enter our business, or re-enter our business with significantly reduced indebtedness following emergence from bankruptcy, or our existing and potential customers may develop their own oilfield services business. Our ability to maintain current revenues and cash flows, and our ability to market our services and expand our operations, could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the\ndevelopment and marketing of competitive services or substantially decrease the prices at which they offer their services, we may be unable to effectively compete. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. The competitive environment may be further intensified by mergers and acquisitions among oil and natural gas companies or other events that have the effect of reducing the number of available customers. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Some of our larger competitors provide a broader range of services on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may have a greater ability to continue oilfield service activities during periods of low commodity prices and to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations. Any inability to compete effectively could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing competition for workers, as well as labor shortages, could adversely affect our business.\nA number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, increased competition for employees both within the oilfield service industry and the larger labor market, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations. Although we have not experienced any material labor shortages to date, we have observed an increasingly competitive labor market. The increasing competition for employees could result in higher compensation costs and difficulties in maintaining a capable workforce to operate our equipment. If we are unable to hire and retain employees, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. A sustained labor shortage, lack of skilled labor force, increased turnover, or labor cost inflation, caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, which could negatively affect our ability to efficiently staff and operate our equipment, deploy additional assets to meet customer demand, and have other adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCustomers and Employees\nReliance upon a few large customers may adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nIf a major customer fails to pay us, our revenues would be impacted and our operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. During times when the natural gas or crude oil markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience financial difficulties, including being unable to access debt or equity financing, which could result in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending for our services and their non-payment or inability to perform obligations owed to us. Further, if a customer was to enter into bankruptcy, it could also result in the cancellation of all or a portion of our service contracts with such customer at significant expense or loss of expected revenues to us. If we were to lose any material customer, we may not be able to redeploy our equipment at similar utilization or pricing levels or within a short period of time and such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects until the equipment is redeployed at similar utilization or pricing levels. It is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, EOG and Conoco, accounted for approximately 15% and 10% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. The table below presents the percentage of revenues, for each respective segment, from our top five customers for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nOur customers may be forced to curtail or shut in production due to a lack of storage capacity.\nThe marketing of oil, natural gas and NGLs production depends in large part on the availability, proximity and capacity of trucks, pipelines and storage facilities, gas gathering systems and other transportation, processing and refining facilities, as well as the existence of adequate markets. Because of the significantly reduced demand for oil and natural gas as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current oversupply of oil and natural gas in the market, available storage and transportation capacity for our customers\u2019 production may be limited or completely unavailable in the future. If there is insufficient capacity available on these systems, if these systems are unavailable to our customers, or if these systems are unavailable to our customers on commercially reasonable terms, the prices our customers receive for their production could\nbe significantly depressed. In April 2020, extreme shortages of transportation and storage capacity caused the WTI oil futures closing price to go as low as a negative $37 per Bbl. This negative pricing resulted from the holders of expiring front month oil purchase contracts being unable or unwilling to take physical delivery of crude oil and accordingly forced to make payments to purchasers of such contracts in order to transfer the corresponding purchase obligations.\nAs a result of any further storage and/or transportation shortages, our customers could be forced to shut in some or all of their production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons while they construct or purchase their own facilities or system. If our customers are forced to shut in production, it would result in decreased demand for our services and lower utilization of our assets.\nWe rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business.\nMany key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The loss of their services could adversely affect our business. In particular, the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team, including our President and Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, could disrupt our operations. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nUnsatisfactory safety performance may negatively affect our current and future customer relationships and, to the extent we fail to retain existing customers or attract new customers, adversely impact our revenues.\nOur ability to retain existing customers and attract new business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to demonstrate that we can reliably and safely operate our business in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and permits, which legal requirements are subject to change. Existing and potential customers consider the safety record of their third-party service providers to be of high importance in their decision to engage such providers. If one or more accidents were to occur at one of our operating sites, the affected customer may seek to terminate or cancel its use of our equipment or services and may be less likely to continue to use our services, which could cause us to lose substantial revenues. Furthermore, our ability to attract new customers may be impaired if they view our safety record as unacceptable. In addition, it is possible that we will experience multiple or particularly severe accidents in the future, causing our safety record to deteriorate. This may be more likely as we continue to grow, if we experience high employee turnover or labor shortage, or hire inexperienced personnel to bolster our staffing needs.\nWe may be subject to claims for personal injury and property damage, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur services are subject to inherent risks that can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment or the suspension of our operations. Litigation arising from operations where our services are provided may cause us to be named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims including claims for exemplary damages. We maintain what we believe is customary and reasonable insurance to protect our business against these potential losses, but such insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities, and we are not fully insured against all risks.\nIn addition, and subject to certain exceptions, our customers typically assume responsibility for, including control and removal of, all other pollution or contamination which may occur during operations, including that which may result from seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of drilling and completion fluids. We may have liability in such cases if we are negligent or commit willful acts. Our customers generally agree to indemnify us against claims arising from their employees\u2019 personal injury or death to the extent that, in the case of our operations, their employees are injured or their properties are damaged by such operations, unless resulting from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Our customers also generally agree to indemnify us for loss or destruction of customer-owned property or equipment. In turn, we agree to indemnify our customers for loss or destruction of property or equipment we own and for liabilities arising from personal injury to or death of any of our employees, unless resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the customer. However, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation or might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation. As a result, we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe provide services to customers who operate on federal and tribal lands, which are subject to additional regulations.\nWe provide services to companies operating on federal and tribal lands. Various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the BLM and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, along with certain Native American tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas operations on Native American tribal lands and minerals where some of our customers operate. Such operations are subject to additional regulatory requirements, including lease provisions, drilling and production requirements, surface use restrictions, environmental standards, royalty considerations and taxes. Operations on federal and tribal lands are frequently subject to delays.\nIn November 2016, the BLM finalized a rule regulating the venting and flaring of natural gas, leak detection, air emissions from equipment, well maintenance and unloading, drilling and completions and royalties potentially owed for loss of such emissions from oil and natural gas facilities producing on federal and tribal leases. In September 2018, the BLM published a revised rule which rescinded and revised several components of the 2016 rule. However, in July 2020 and October 2020, federal district courts in California and Wyoming, respectively, vacated these rulemakings, and on January 20, 2021, President Biden published an executive order calling for the review and potential revision of the September 2018 rule. Because of the foregoing, methane requirements on federal land remain uncertain at this time.\nThe EPA also issued a FIP in June 2016 to implement the Federal Minor New Source Review Program on tribal lands for oil and natural gas production. The FIP creates a permit-by-rule process for minor air sources that also incorporates emission limits and other requirements under various federal air quality standards, applying them to a range of equipment and processes used in oil and natural gas production. Neither the FIP nor the revisions apply in areas of ozone non-attainment, except, as the result of a May 2019 rule, to the Indian country portion of the Uinta Basin Ozone Nonattainment Area. As a result, the EPA may impose area-specific regulations in certain areas identified as tribal lands that may require additional emissions controls on existing equipment. Such requirements will likely result in increased operating and compliance costs for our customers in these regions. Additionally, the Biden Administration has taken several actions to curtail oil and gas development on federal lands; for more information, see our regulatory disclosure titled \u201cHydraulic Fracturing.\u201d\nDepending on the ultimate outcome of any agency reviews and pending litigation, these regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions for us and our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, and demand for our services.\nGovernmental and Regulatory Changes\nIncreases in the scope or pace of midstream infrastructure development, or decreased federal or state regulation of natural gas pipelines, could decrease demand for our services.\nIncreases in the scope or pace of midstream infrastructure development could decrease demand for our services. Our processing solutions are designed for the processing of rich natural gas streams at the wellhead or central gathering points in basins where drilling and completion activity has outpaced the development of permanent processing infrastructure. Specifically, our modular MRUs are used by our customers to meet pipeline specifications, extract higher value NGLs, provide fuel gas for well sites and facilities and reduce emissions at the flare tip, services that are generally required when E&P companies drill oil and natural gas wells in basins without immediate access to sufficient midstream infrastructure and takeaway capacity. To the extent that permanent midstream infrastructure is developed in the basins in which we operate, or the pace of existing development is accelerated as a result of customer demand, the demand for our processing solutions could decrease.\nIn addition, there has recently been increasing public controversy regarding construction of new natural gas pipelines and the stringency of current regulation of natural gas pipelines, creating uncertainty as to the probability and timing of such construction. Decreases to the stringency of regulation of existing natural gas pipelines at either the state or federal level could reduce the demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDelays or restrictions in obtaining permits by us for our operations or by our customers for their operations could impair our business.\nIn most states, our operations and the operations of our customers require permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to perform drilling and completion activities, secure water rights, or other regulated activities. Such permits are typically issued by state agencies, but federal and local governmental permits may also be required. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location where such regulated activities will be conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit\nto be issued, and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. In addition, some of our customers\u2019 drilling and completion activities may take place on federal land or Native American lands, requiring leases and other approvals from the federal government or Native American tribes to conduct such drilling and completion activities or other regulated activities. Under certain circumstances, federal agencies may cancel proposed leases for federal lands and refuse to grant or delay required approvals. Therefore, our customers\u2019 operations in certain areas of the United States may be interrupted or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a loss of revenues to us and adversely affecting our results of operations in support of those customers.\nFederal or state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to induced seismicity could result in operating restrictions or delays in the drilling and completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur oil and natural gas customers dispose of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas producing operations in accordance with permits issued by government authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of flow back and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity.\nIn response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. From time to time regulators develop and implement plans directing certain wells located in proximity to seismic incidents to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. For example, in September 2021, the TRRC issued a notice to disposal well operators in the Gardendale Seismic Response Area near Midland, Texas to reduce daily injection volumes following multiple earthquakes above a 3.5 magnitude over an 18 month period. The notice also required disposal well operators to provide injection data to TRRC staff to further analyze seismicity in the area. Subsequently, the TRRC ordered the indefinite suspension of all deep oil and gas produced water injection wells in the area, effective December 31, 2021. In addition, ongoing lawsuits allege that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our customers to dispose of flowback and produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal.\nAny one or more of these developments may result in our customers having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require our customers or third party disposal well operators that are used to disposals of customers\u2019 wastewater to shut down disposal wells, which developments could adversely affect our customers\u2019 business and result in a corresponding decrease in the need for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in transportation regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various transportation regulations including as a motor carrier by the DOT and by various federal, state and tribal agencies, whose regulations include certain permit requirements of highway and safety authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers over our trucking operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing, driver requirements and specifications and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, such as changes in fuel emissions limits, hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, requirements for on-board black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size. To the extent the federal government continues to develop and propose regulations relating to fuel quality, engine efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, we may experience an increase in costs related to truck purchases and maintenance, impairment of equipment productivity, a decrease in the residual value of vehicles, unpredictable fluctuations in fuel prices and an increase in operating expenses. Increased truck traffic may contribute to deteriorating road conditions in some areas where our operations are performed.\nFurther, our operations could be affected by road construction, road repairs, detours and state and local regulations and ordinances restricting access to certain roads, including through routing and weight restrictions. In recent years, certain states, such as North Dakota and Texas, and certain counties have increased enforcement of weight limits on trucks used to transport raw materials, such as the fluids that we transport in connection with our fluids management services, on their public roads. It\nis possible that the states, counties and cities in which we operate our business may modify their laws to further reduce truck weight limits or impose curfews or other restrictions on the use of roadways. Such legislation and enforcement efforts could result in delays in, and increased costs to, transport fluids and otherwise conduct our business. Proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, are also made from time to time, and any such increase would increase our operating costs. Also, state and local regulation of permitted routes and times on specific roadways could adversely affect our operations. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes or municipal ordinances applicable to our logistics operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.\nWe are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of natural resources and the environment, occupational health and safety, air emissions and water discharges, and the management, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and other materials. These laws and regulations impose numerous obligations that may impact our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the imposition of restrictions on the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected in formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities, the incurrence of capital expenditures to mitigate or prevent releases of materials from our equipment, facilities or from customer locations where we are providing services, the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations, and the application of specific health and safety standards or criteria addressing worker protection. Any failure on our part or the part of our customers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in prohibitions or restrictions on operations, assessment of sanctions including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, issuance of corrective action orders requiring the performance of investigatory, remedial or curative activities or enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in a particular area, the occurrence of delays in the permitting or performance of projects and/or government or private claims for personal injury or property or natural resources damages.\nOur business activities present risks of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities, including costs and liabilities resulting from our handling and disposal of oilfield and other wastes, air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations and the historical operations and waste disposal practices of our predecessors. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. In addition, private parties, including the owners of properties upon which we perform services and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability even if our conduct was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties.\nThe trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects if we are unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Our customers may also incur increased costs or delays or restrictions in permitting or operating activities as a result of more stringent environmental laws and regulations, which may result in a curtailment of exploration, development or production activities that would reduce the demand for our services.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays as well as adversely affect demand for our support services.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. While we do not perform hydraulic fracturing, many of our customers do.\nHydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel and issued permitting guidance in 2014 that applies to such activities. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA finalized regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants.\nIn December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain limited circumstances. Since the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, this years-long study report does not appear to provide any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level at this time.\nHowever, certain of our customers have operations on federal or tribal lands. The Biden Administration has announced that it is considering more stringent regulations for operations on such lands, and in January 2021, President Biden issued an executive order suspending new leasing activities, but not operations under existing leases, for oil and gas exploration and production on non-Indian federal lands pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices that take into consideration potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities on such lands and waters. Although the federal court for the Western District of Louisiana issued a preliminary injunction against the leasing pause, in response to the executive order, the Department of Interior issued a report recommending various changes to the federal leasing program, though many such changes would require Congressional action. As a result, we cannot predict the final scope of regulations or restrictions that may apply to oil and gas operations on federal lands. However, any regulations that ban or effectively ban such operations may adversely impact demand for our products and services.\nVarious state and local governments have also implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, well construction, and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas. For example, in April 2019, the State of Colorado adopted Senate Bill 19-181 which made sweeping changes to Colorado oil and gas law to include the adopting of rules to minimize emissions of methane and other air contaminants and the prioritization of public health and environmental concerns in decisions made by the COGCC. In keeping with these changes, in November 2020, COGCC made substantial revisions to several regulations concerning protections for public health, safety, welfare, wildlife, and environmental resources. For further information, see our disclosure \u201cPart I, Item 1. Business - State and Local Regulations.\u201d In addition, state and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements on hydraulic fracturing fluid disposal practices, including restrictions on the operations of produced water disposal wells and imposing more stringent requirements on the permitting of such wells. For more information, see our regulatory disclosure titled \u201cHydraulic Fracturing.\u201d The adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our customers\u2019 ability to dispose of produced water could result in increased operating costs for the customer, which in turn could indirectly reduce demand for our services.\nLocal governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could result in decreased oil and natural gas E&P activities and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our services and our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nOur operations, and those of our customers, are subject to a series of risks arising from climate change.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHG.\nIn the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, President Biden has highlighted addressing climate change as a priority of his administration, which includes certain potential initiatives for climate change legislation to be proposed and passed into law. Moreover, following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, and together with the DOT, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. The federal regulation of methane emissions from oil and gas facilities has been subject to substantially controversy in recent years; for more information, please see our regulatory disclosure \u201cAir Emissions.\u201d Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement, requires member states to submit non-binding individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. Following President Biden\u2019s executive order in January 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement and, in April 2021, established a goal of reducing economy-wide net GHG emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Additionally, at the 26th Conference of the Parties (\u201cCOP26\u201d) in Glasgow in November 2021, the United States and the European Union jointly announced the launch of a Global Methane Pledge; an initiative committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, including \u201call feasible reductions\u201d in the energy sector. However, the impacts of these actions remain unclear at this time.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate change related pledges made by certain candidates for political office. These have included promises to pursue actions to limit emissions and curtail the production of oil and gas on federal land. For more information, see our regulatory disclosure titled \u201cHydraulic Fracturing.\u201d Other actions that could be pursued by the Biden Administration may include the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of LNG export facilities, as well as more restrictive GHG emission limitations for oil and gas facilities. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of parties have sought to bring suit against certain oil and natural gas companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change or alleging that companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors or customers by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for companies in the fossil fuel sector as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel related companies may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments to other sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. For example, at COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (\u201cGFANZ\u201d) announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over $130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals. The various sub-alliances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short-term, sector-specific targets to transition their financing, investing, and/or underwriting activities to net zero emissions by 2050. There is also a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. In late 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve has issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced its intention to promulgate rules requiring climate disclosures. Although the form and substance of these requirements is not yet known, this may result in additional costs to comply with any such disclosure requirements.\nThe adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas, which could reduce demand for our services and products. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in our oil and natural gas customers restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand\nfor our services and products. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nMoreover, climate change may result in various physical risks, such as the increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events or changes in meteorological and hydrological patterns, that could adversely impact us, our customers\u2019, and our suppliers\u2019 operations. For more information, see our risk factor titled \u201cSeasonal weather conditions and natural disasters could severely disrupt normal operations and harm our business.\u201d\nIncreased attention to environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters and conservation measures may adversely impact our or our customers\u2019 business.\nIncreasing attention to, and societal expectations on companies to address, climate change and other environmental and social impacts, investor and societal expectations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures, and consumer demand for alternative forms of energy may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our customers\u2019 products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change and environmental conservation, for example, may result in demand shifts for oil and natural gas products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against us or our customers. To the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For more information, see our risk factor titled \u201cOur operations, and those of our suppliers and customers, are subject to a series of risks arising from climate change.\u201d\nMoreover, while we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, certain statements in those voluntary disclosures may be based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters. Additionally, we may announce various targets or product and service offerings in an attempt to improve our ESG profile. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet any such targets or that such targets or offerings will have the intended results on our ESG profile, including but not limited to as a result of unforeseen 27 costs, consequences, or technical difficulties associated with such targets or offerings. Also, despite any voluntary actions, we may receive pressure from certain investors, lenders, or other groups to adopt more aggressive climate or other ESG-related goals or policies, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement such goals because of potential costs or technical or operational obstacles.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings and recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, to the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, we may not be able to compete as effectively to recruit or retain employees, which may adversely affect our operations.\nThe Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act and other restrictions intended to protect certain species of wildlife govern our and our customers\u2019 operations and additional restrictions may be imposed in the future, which constraints could have an adverse impact on our ability to expand some of our existing operations or limit our customers\u2019 ability to develop new oil and natural gas wells.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife, which may limit our ability to operate in protected areas. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures.\nFor example, to the extent species that are listed under the Endangered Species Act or similar state laws, or are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, or the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we or our customers operate could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and could result in delays or limitations in our or our customers\u2019 performance of operations, which could adversely affect or reduce demand for our services.\nAnti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\nWe typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the provision of our services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party\u2019s indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy\nWe may be subject to interruptions or failures in our information technology systems.\nWe rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business, including process control technology. Any of these systems are susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, usage errors by employees, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other security breaches or similar events. The failure of any of our information technology systems may cause disruptions in our operations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nWe depend on information technology systems that we manage, and others that are managed by our third-party service and equipment providers, to conduct our day-to-day operations, including critical systems, and these systems are subject to risk associated with cyber incidents or attacks, especially originating from countries such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as broadly reported in the media. Our technology systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches. These cyber security risks could disrupt our operations and result in downtime or the loss, theft, corruption or unauthorized release of intellectual property, proprietary information, customer and vendor data or other critical data, as well as result in higher costs to correct and remedy the effects of such incidents. Certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period of time. As the sophistication of cyber incidents continues to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Our insurance coverage for cyber-attacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of such cyber-attacks.\nRisks Related to Our Ownership and Capital Structure\nFinancial Leverage and Liquidity\nWe have debt obligations, and any additional future indebtedness, could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020 our total debt was $63.2 million and $25.2 million, respectively.\nWe may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could intensify. Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022we may fail to comply with the various covenants in instruments governing any existing or future indebtedness;\n\u2022we may be unable to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022we may be unable to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service the debt;\n\u2022we could become more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, to the extent that we incur variable rate indebtedness; or\n\u2022we may be competitively disadvantaged compared to our competitors that have greater access to capital resources.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility subjects us to various financial and other restrictive covenants. These restrictions may limit our operational or financial flexibility and could subject us to potential defaults under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility subjects us to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, such that our ability to comply with financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our control, including economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. Further, the borrowing base of our Revolving Credit Facility is dependent upon our receivables, which may be significantly lower in the future due to reduced activity levels or decreases in pricing for our services. Changes to our operational activity levels have an impact on our total eligible accounts receivable, which could result in significant changes to our borrowing base and therefore our availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. If we are unable to remain in compliance with the financial covenants of our Revolving Credit Facility, then amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become due immediately. Any such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn the event that we are unable to access sufficient capital to fund our business and planned capital expenditures, we may be required to curtail potential acquisitions, strategic growth projects, portions of our current operations and other activities. A lack of capital could result in a decrease in our operations, subject us to claims of breach under customer and supplier contracts and may force us to sell some of our assets or issue additional equity on an untimely or unfavorable basis, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including a certain minimum fixed charge coverage ratio during certain testing periods. The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base that is calculated based upon a percentage of the value of the Company\u2019s eligible accounts receivable less certain reserves. The Revolving Credit Facility includes cash dominion provisions where the Administrative Agent sweeps cash daily from the Company\u2019s bank accounts into an account of the Administrative Agent to repay the Company\u2019s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating acquired assets, including assets acquired in the Patriot Acquisition, the PerfX Acquisition and the Basic Acquisition, into our business and in realizing the expected benefits of an acquisition.\nThe success of an acquisition, if completed, will depend in part on our ability to realize anticipated business opportunities from combining acquired assets, including assets acquired in the Patriot Acquisition, the PerfX Acquisition and the Basic Acquisition, with our business in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or other third parties or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits, and could harm our financial performance. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate acquired assets with our business, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the anticipated benefits, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe growth of our business through potential future acquisitions may expose us to various risks, including those relating to difficulties in identifying suitable, accretive acquisition opportunities and integrating businesses, assets and personnel, as well as difficulties in obtaining financing for targeted acquisitions and the potential for increased leverage or debt service requirements.\nWe will continue to pursue selected, accretive acquisitions of complementary assets and businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022unanticipated costs and exposure to liabilities assumed in connection with the acquired business or assets, including but not limited to environmental liabilities;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the operations and assets of the acquired business and the acquired personnel;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to properly assess and maintain an effective internal control environment over an acquired business;\n\u2022potential losses of key employees and customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022risks of entering markets in which we have limited prior experience; and\n\u2022increases in our expenses and working capital requirements.\nOur ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend, in part, upon whether we can integrate the acquired business and/or assets into our existing business in an efficient and effective manner. The process of integrating an acquired business, including in connection with our corporate reorganization, may involve unforeseen costs and delays or other operational, technical and financial difficulties and may require a significant amount of time and resources. Our failure to incorporate the acquired business and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, any acquisition may involve other risks that may cause our business to suffer, including:\n\u2022diversion of our management\u2019s attention to evaluating, negotiating for and integrating acquired assets;\n\u2022the challenge and cost of integrating acquired assets with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business; and\n\u2022the failure to realize the full benefits anticipated from the acquisition or to realize these benefits within our expected time frame.\nBecause the historical utilization rates of any acquired assets may be lower than ours in recent periods, our utilization could decrease during the course of an initial integration period. Accordingly, there can be no assurance the utilization for acquired assets will align with the utilization of our existing fleet or on our anticipated timeline or at all. Furthermore, there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions.\nIn addition, we may not have sufficient capital resources to complete any additional acquisitions. We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity, debt or convertible securities in connection with such acquisitions. Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain additional financing as needed or on satisfactory terms.\nOur ability to continue to grow through acquisitions and manage growth will require us to continue to invest in operational, financial and management information systems and to attract, retain, motivate and effectively manage our employees. The inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions, including in connection with our corporate reorganization, could reduce our focus on current operations, which, in turn, could negatively impact our earnings and growth. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely impact the price of our shares, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes.\nInterest rates on future borrowings, credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. In addition, the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other \u201cbenchmark\u201d rates are subject to ongoing national and international regulatory scrutiny and reform. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR rates after 2021 (the \u201cFCA Announcement\u201d). The Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a committee convened by the Federal Reserve that includes major market participants, has selected an alternative rate to replace U.S. Dollar LIBOR: the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or \u201cSOFR.\u201d Lenders are considering We are unable to predict the effect of the FCA Announcement or other reforms, whether currently enacted or enacted in the future. The outcome of reforms may result in increased interest expense to us. Changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes.\nEquity and Common Stock\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in those internal controls, subject to any exemptions that we avail ourselves to under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). We and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company is working to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting and is taking steps to improve the internal control environment. Specifically, the Company is enhancing processes, and designing and implementing additional internal controls to properly account for complex transactions. Additionally, the Company is hiring additional accounting personnel and implementing training of new and existing personnel on proper execution of designed control procedures.\nOur failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIf we were to pay cash dividends in the future on our Class A Common Stock, our Revolving Credit Facility places certain restrictions on our ability to do so. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our Class A Common Stock appreciates.\nWe have not paid any dividends since our inception to holders of our Class A Common Stock and currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth of our business. Additionally, our Revolving Credit Facility places certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if you sell your Class A Common Stock at a price greater than you paid for it. There is no guarantee that the price of our Class A Common Stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price that you paid for it.\nFuture sales of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or preferred stock or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell additional shares of Class A Common Stock or preferred stock that is convertible into Class A Common Stock in subsequent public offerings. As of March 23, 2022, we had 18,671,361 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding, which may be resold immediately in the public market, and 6,000,001 shares of preferred stock outstanding. The Legacy Owners and the Bridge Loan Lenders are parties to a registration rights agreement, which requires us to effect the registration of any shares of Class A Common Stock held by a Legacy Owner or Bridge Loan Lender or that a Legacy Owner or Bridge Loan Lender receives upon redemption of its shares of Class B Common Stock.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A Common Stock or preferred stock convertible into Class A Common Stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A Common Stock will have on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe may issue additional preferred stock, the terms of which could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A Common Stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A Common Stock. For example, we may grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the Class A Common Stock.\nRisks Associated with Owning Our Common Stock\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company and/or a smaller reporting company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements that apply to other public companies.\nWe are classified as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d) and as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the Exchange Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company (\u201cEGC\u201d), which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to, among other things: (i) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley; (ii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; (iii) provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or (iv) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation. We will remain an EGC for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if we have more than $1.07 billion of revenues in a fiscal year, have more than $700.0 million in market value of our Class A Common Stock held by non-affiliates or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. The Company will lose its EGC status during the year ending December 31, 2022, as this will represent the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial Form S-1, which was filed in August 2017.\nFor as long as we are a smaller reporting company, we will have certain reduced disclosure requirements with the SEC, including the ability to provide two years of audited financial statements and corresponding Management's Discussion and Analysis disclosures. We will lose our EGC status at the end of that five-year period, we will be required to comply with all the reporting requirements applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates, calculated as of the end of our most recently complete second fiscal quarter, exceeds $250 million. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because of our reliance on any of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nTo the extent that we rely on any of the exemptions available to EGC\u2019s and/or SRC\u2019s, you will receive less information about our executive compensation and internal control over financial reporting than issuers that are not emerging growth companies. If some investors find our Class A Common Stock to be less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAs a result of the delay in completing the Rule 3-05 financial statements related to the Basic Energy acquisition, we are currently unable to register securities with the SEC.\nThis may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and the cost of raising future capital. As a result of the delay in completing the Rule 3-05 financial statements required by the Current Report on Form 8-K relating to the acquisition of certain assets of Basic, we have been, and remain, unable to register securities for sale by us or for resale by other security holders, which adversely affects our ability to raise capital. Additionally, following the filing of this Form 10-K we will remain ineligible to use Form S-3 to register securities until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the Exchange Act for at least 12 calendar months. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public when we are ineligible to use Form S-3, both our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase as a result of having to use Form S-1, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction quickly and successfully, and as a result potentially harming our financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A Common Stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company adversely changes his or her recommendation with respect to our Class A Common Stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nCSL and Other Directors\nCSL, Bayou Holdings and their respective affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could enable CSL and Bayou Holdings to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nOur governing documents provide that CSL, Bayou Holdings and their respective affiliates (including portfolio investments of CSL and its affiliates) are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, among other things:\n\u2022permits CSL, Bayou Holdings and their respective affiliates to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and\n\u2022provides that if CSL, Bayou Holdings or their respective affiliates, or any employee, partner, member, manager, officer or director of CSL, Bayou Holdings or their respective affiliates who is also one of our directors or officers, becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us.\nCSL, Bayou Holdings or their respective affiliates may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Furthermore, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to not be available to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue. In addition, CSL, Bayou Holdings and their respective affiliates may dispose of equipment or other assets in the future, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. As a result, our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to CSL, Bayou Holdings and their respective affiliates could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours.\nCSL controls a large portion of our voting stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other shareholders.\nCSL and its affiliates beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 38% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. As long as CSL controls a large portion of our voting stock, it may be able to significantly influence the election of the Board of Directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote. Moreover, CSL\u2019s concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a significant shareholder. CSL\u2019s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion.\nA significant reduction of CSL\u2019s ownership interests in us could adversely affect us.\nWe believe that CSL\u2019s ownership interest in us provides with it an economic incentive to assist us to be successful. CSL is not subject to any obligation to maintain its ownership interest in us and may elect at any time to sell all or a substantial portion of or otherwise reduce its ownership interest in us. If CSL sells all or a substantial portion of its ownership interest in us, it may have less incentive to assist in our success and its affiliate(s) that are expected to serve as members of our Board of Directors may resign.\nCertain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may compete with us in seeking acquisitions and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities.\nCertain of our directors, who are responsible for managing the direction of our operations, hold positions of responsibility with other entities (including affiliated entities) that are in the oil and natural gas industry. These executive officers and directors may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to the other entities with which they are or may become affiliated. Due to these existing and potential future affiliations, these individuals may present potential business opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. They may also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated, and as a result, they may elect not to present those opportunities to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor.", "PERMNO": 16866, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "RNGR"}
