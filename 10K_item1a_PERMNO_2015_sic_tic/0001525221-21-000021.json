RISK FACTORS\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by numerous risks and uncertainties. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. These risks and uncertainties represent some of the more critical risk factors that affect us, in addition to the other information that has been provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business operations or actual results could also be similarly impacted by additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial to our operations.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\u2022the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions, including a decrease in the price of and demand for oil.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u2022failure to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger;\n\u2022inadequate or unfavorable sources of capital funding;\n\u2022potential significant corporate transactions may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations or result in unforeseeable risks to our business;\n\u2022inherent risks related to our operations, some of which may not be covered by our insurance;\n\u2022failure to maintain standards of acceptable safety performance;\n\u2022unsuccessful diversification efforts into other aviation services;\n\u2022a concentration of certain helicopter models in our fleet could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations should any problems specific to these particular models occur;\n\u2022the market value of our helicopter fleet is dependent on a number of external factors;\n\u2022the level of activity in the North Sea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico;\n\u2022failure to dispose of aircraft through sales into the aftermarket;\n\u2022dependence on a small number of helicopter manufacturers and lessors;\n\u2022a shortfall in availability of aircraft components and parts required for maintenance and repairs of our helicopter and fixed wing aircraft and supplier cost increases;\n\u2022ability to grow in core markets and expand into new business lines and international markets; and\n\u2022our operations are subject to weather-related and seasonal fluctuations.\nRisks Related to Our Customers and Contracts\n\u2022a focus by our customers on cost-saving measures rather than quality of service;\n\u2022our industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition;\n\u2022we depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue;\n\u2022our contracts often can be terminated or downsized by our customers without penalty;\n\u2022our U.K. SAR contract can be terminated and is subject to certain other rights of the DfT;\n\u2022reductions in spending on aviation services by governmental agencies could lead to modifications of contract terms or delays in receiving payments;\n\u2022our fixed operating expenses and long-term contracts with customers could adversely affect our business under certain circumstances; and\n\u2022consolidation of and asset sales by, our customer base could materially adversely affect demand for our services and reduce our revenues.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Gas Industry\n\u2022the demand for our services is substantially dependent on the level of offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production activity;\n\u2022unconventional crude oil and natural gas sources and improved economics of producing natural gas and oil from such sources have exerted and could continue to exert downward pricing pressures; and\n\u2022any significant development impacting deepwater drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nRisks Related to Legal, Tax and Regulatory Matters\n\u2022we operate in many international areas through entities that we do not control and are subject to government regulation that limits foreign ownership of aircraft companies in favor of domestic ownership;\n\u2022environmental regulations and liabilities;\n\u2022U.S. and foreign social, political, regulatory and economic conditions as well as changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. government;\n\u2022legal compliance risks, including anti-corruption statutes;\n\u2022actions taken by governmental agencies, such as the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation and the FAA, and similar agencies in the other jurisdictions in which we operate; and\n\u2022changes in effective tax rates, taxation of our foreign subsidiaries or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns;\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Corporate Structure\n\u2022our stock price may fluctuate significantly;\n\u2022securities analyst coverage or lack of coverage may have a negative impact on our stock price;\n\u2022provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in our management;\n\u2022regulations limit foreign ownership of the Company, which could reduce the price of our common stock and cause owners of our common stock who are not U.S. persons to lose their voting rights; and\n\u2022our certificate of incorporation includes a forum selection clause, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nGeneral Risks\n\u2022failure to attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022adverse results of legal proceedings;\n\u2022service interruptions, data corruption, cyberattacks or network security breaches;\n\u2022material weaknesses in or failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls;\n\u2022failure to develop or implement new technologies; and\n\u2022increasing attention to environmental, social and governance matters.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have resulted, and may continue to result, in a decrease in the price of and demand for oil, which has caused, and may continue to cause, a decrease in the demand for our services.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility, uncertainty and turmoil in businesses globally, particularly in the oil and gas industry. These events have directly affected our business and have exacerbated the potential negative impact from many of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those relating to our customers\u2019 capital spending and trends in oil and natural gas prices. In addition, our ability to move aircraft has been impacted by the quarantine requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIn an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including those in which we have significant operations such as the U.K. and the U.S., imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel and business leading to a substantial reduction in global economic activity. While lower infection rates coupled with the availability of vaccines for COVID-19 has caused some economic activity to recover, the return to a normal business and economic environment, as well as the capital spending decisions of oil and gas producers, will ultimately depend on infections rates and the pace of deployment of the vaccine.\nIn the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in the first quarter of 2020, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producing countries (\u201cOPEC+\u201d) were initially unable to reach an agreement to continue to impose limits on the production of crude oil. Oil demand significantly deteriorated as a result of the preventative measures taken around the world to mitigate the spread of the virus. The convergence of these events created the unprecedented dual impact of a global oil demand decline.. Although OPEC+ agreed in April 2020 to cut oil production and extended production cuts through March 2021, there is no assurance that the agreement will continue or be observed by its parties. Although oil and gas prices have recovered from their April 2020 lows, if OPEC+ is unable to agree on production limits in the future it could cause prices to decrease to pre-pandemic prices.\nIn addition to the effect on demand for our services discussed above, the pandemic affected the health of our workforce. International, national and local government interventions enacted to reduce the spread of COVID-19 limited our employees\u2019 ability to work and travel in certain circumstances. As a result, we may continue to see our workforce productivity reduced or incur increased medical costs or insurance premiums as a result of these health risks, which could also significantly disrupt our ability to provide helicopter services and equipment to our customers. For instance, if an outbreak occurs among our pilots, technicians or other employees who must be present at operating bases, it is highly unlikely that we will be able to find replacements while the affected employees are quarantined. We are strongly encouraging our workforce to obtain a vaccine to the extent available in their respective jurisdiction.\nThe duration and severity of the business disruption and related financial impact from the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. While we believe we currently have sufficient liquidity to operate our business even if the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period of time or worsens, we cannot provide assurance that any such event related to the pandemic would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger.\nThe success of the June 2020 Merger, including operational benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the businesses of the merged companies in a manner that does not materially result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees. The success of our integration may be more difficult than expected because of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our operations, including the fact that many of our key employees are working remotely. Other difficulties that may arise include: integrating the companies\u2019 operations and corporate functions; integrating and unifying the product offerings and services available to customers; combining operating practices, employee development, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes; possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies; consolidating the companies\u2019 administrative and information technology systems; integrating accounting, finance, payroll, reporting and regulatory compliance systems; and managing a significantly larger company than before the Merger.\nWe incurred material one-time costs to achieve Merger-related synergies and may fail to realize such estimated synergies. While we believe these synergies are achievable, our ability to achieve such estimated synergies in the amounts and time frame expected is subject to various assumptions based on expectations that are subject to a number of risks, which may or may not be realized, the incurrence of other costs in our operations that may offset all or a portion of such synergies and other factors outside our control. In addition, if we fail to achieve the anticipated cost benefits in a timely manner, we may be unable to realize all the anticipated synergies. Failure to achieve the expected synergies could significantly reduce the expected benefits associated with the Merger and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to support our business, we may require additional capital in the future that may not be available to us.\nOur business is capital intensive, and to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we will need to raise additional funds to, among other things, purchase new equipment and maintain currently owned equipment. Adequate sources of capital funding may not be available when needed, or may not be available on favorable terms. If we raise additional debt financing, we will incur additional interest expense and the terms of such debt may be at less favorable rates than existing debt and could require the pledge of additional assets as security or subject us to financial and/or operating covenants that affect our ability to conduct our business. The issuance of additional equity or equity-linked capital could have the effect of diluting current stockholders. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may be unable to acquire additional aircraft, take advantage of business opportunities, fund operating losses or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. See discussion of our capital commitments in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources-Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments.\u201d\nWe may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.\nWe continuously evaluate the acquisition or disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions, such as the Merger. Any such transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests. The consideration for such acquisitive transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in us or our subsidiaries, or a contribution of equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets.\nThese transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant revenue and income streams, increased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain covenants in our debt agreements (including accelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations or the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, thereby diluting holders of our common stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate, or the replacement of the London Interbank Offered Rate with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.\nIt is expected that a number of private-sector banks currently reporting information used to set the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) will stop doing so after 2021 when their current reporting commitment ends, which could either cause LIBOR to stop publication immediately or cause LIBOR\u2019s regulator to determine that its quality has degraded to the degree that it is no longer representative of its underlying market. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. Borrowings under our current and future indebtedness may bear interest at rates tied to LIBOR. In the future, we may need to renegotiate our existing indebtedness or incur other indebtedness, and the phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOur operations involve a degree of inherent risk, some of which may not be covered by our insurance and may increase our operating costs or adversely affect our liquidity.\nThe operation of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft inherently involves a substantial degree of risk. Hazards such as harsh weather and marine conditions, mechanical failures, facility fires, spare parts damage, pandemic outbreaks, human error, crashes and collisions are inherent risks in our business and may result in personal injury, loss of life, damage to property and equipment, suspension or reduction of operations, reduced number of flight hours, the grounding of the aircraft involved in the incident or an entire fleet of the same aircraft type, or insufficient ground facilities or spare parts to support operations. In addition to any loss of property or life, our revenue, profitability and margins could be materially affected by an accident or asset damage.\nWe, or third parties operating our aircraft, may experience accidents or damage to our assets in the future. These risks could endanger the safety of both our own and our customers\u2019 personnel, equipment, cargo and other property, as well as the environment. If any of these incidents were to occur with equipment or other assets that we need to operate or lease to third parties, we could experience loss of revenue, termination of charter contracts, higher insurance rates and damage to our reputation and client relationships. In addition, to the extent an accident occurs with aircraft we operate or to assets supporting operations, we could be held liable for resulting damages.\nCertain models of aircraft that we operate, or have operated in the past, such as the Eurocopter H225, have also experienced accidents while operated by third parties. If other operators experience accidents with aircraft models that we\noperate or lease, obligating us to take such aircraft out of service until the cause of the accident is rectified, we could lose revenue and customers. In addition, safety issues experienced by a particular model of aircraft could result in customers refusing to use that particular aircraft model or a regulatory body grounding that particular aircraft model. The value of the aircraft model might also be permanently reduced in the market if the model were to be considered less desirable for future service and the inventory for such aircraft may be impaired, leading to impairment and similar changes.\nWe attempt to protect ourselves against financial losses and damage by carrying insurance, including hull and liability, general liability, workers\u2019 compensation, employers\u2019 liability, auto liability and property and casualty insurance. Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and maximum coverage amounts, and we do not carry insurance against all types of losses, including business interruption. We cannot assure you that our existing coverage will be sufficient to protect against all losses, that we will be able to maintain our existing coverage in the future or that the premiums will not increase substantially. We also carry insurance for war risk, expropriation and confiscation of the aircraft we use in certain of our international operations. Future terrorist activity, risks of war, accidents or other events could increase our insurance premiums. The loss of any insurance coverage, inadequate coverage from our liability insurance, the payment of significant deductibles or substantial increases in future premiums could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain standards of acceptable safety performance may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customers and could adversely impact our reputation, operations and financial performance.\nOur customers consider safety and reliability as two of the primary attributes when selecting a provider of air transportation services. If we fail to maintain standards of safety and reliability that are satisfactory to our customers, our ability to retain current customers and attract new customers may be adversely affected.\nAccidents or disasters could impact client or passenger confidence in a particular fleet type, we or the air transportation services industry as a whole and could lead to a reduction in client contracts, particularly if such accidents or disasters were due to a safety fault in a type of aircraft used in our fleet. In addition, the loss of aircraft as a result of accidents could cause significant adverse publicity and the interruption of air services to our customers, which could adversely impact our reputation, operations and financial results.\nOur diversification efforts into other aviation services may prove unsuccessful.\nOur business has traditionally been significantly dependent upon the level of offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production activity. Although we, through the Merger and organic growth initiatives, continue to diversify into other aviation services, including SAR services, and we believe that additional government services contracts, prospective offshore wind projects and advanced air mobility present attractive growth and diversification opportunities, the effect of the downturn in the oil and gas industry has nevertheless negatively impacted our financial results and could continue to negatively impact our financial results in future periods. While diversification into other aviation services is intended over the long term to grow the business and offset the cyclical nature of the underlying oil and gas business, we cannot be certain that benefits associated with those other lines of business will be realized at any point or that the costs of entry into such other lines of business, including non-economic costs such as management focus on such new lines of business instead of or in addition to our core business, won\u2019t ultimately exceed the benefit derived from these businesses.\nThe concentration of certain helicopter models in our fleet could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations should any problems specific to these particular models occur.\nCertain helicopter models comprise a significant portion of our helicopter fleet. If the market demand for such models declines, if such models experience technical difficulties or if such models are involved in operational incidents, it could cause a diminution in value of the affected models or the inability to provide services with such model without significant expense or at all. In addition, the bankruptcy or shutdown of a helicopter operator or lessor with a large fleet of such helicopter models may result in an oversupply of such models being made available to the market, which could reduce the rates earned by, and/or the value of, such helicopter models. A significant decline in value of such models that is other than temporary could result in an impairment to the carrying value of our helicopter fleet. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe market value of our helicopter fleet is dependent on a number of external factors.\nThe fair market value of each of our helicopters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022general economic and market conditions and, in particular, those affecting the oil and gas industry, including the price of oil and gas and the level of oil and gas exploration, development and production;\n\u2022the number of comparable helicopters servicing the market;\n\u2022the types and sizes of comparable helicopters available for sale or lease;\n\u2022historical issues with helicopters of the same model;\n\u2022the specific age and attributes of the helicopter;\n\u2022demand for the helicopter in different industries; and\n\u2022changes in regulation or competition from other air transport companies and other modes of transportation.\nDue to the market downturn that the oil and gas industry experienced in recent years, the fair market value of our helicopters has declined in recent periods and may decline further in the future. A decline in helicopter values could result in asset impairment charges, breaches of loan covenants or lower proceeds upon helicopter sales, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations in certain regions of the world are subject to additional risks.\nOperations in certain regions are subject to various risks inherent in conducting business in international locations, including:\n\u2022political, social and economic instability, including risks of war, general strikes and civil disturbances;\n\u2022physical and economic retribution directed at U.S. and foreign companies and personnel;\n\u2022governmental actions that restrict payments or the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights;\n\u2022violations of our Code of Business Integrity;\n\u2022adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange that affect demand for our services and our profitability;\n\u2022potential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the \u201cU.K. Bribery Act\u201d) and Brazil\u2019s Clean Companies Act (the \u201cBCCA\u201d);\n\u2022the taking of property without fair compensation; and\n\u2022the lack of well-developed legal systems in some countries that could make it difficult for us to enforce our contractual and other legal rights.\nFor example, there has been continuing political and social unrest in Nigeria, where we derived 9%, 14% and 15% of our gross revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (Successor), the five months ended March 31, 2020 (Successor) and the seven months ended October 31, 2019 (Predecessor), respectively. In addition, our operations in Nigeria are subject to the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act, 2010 (the \u201cNigerian Content Development Act\u201d), which requires that oil and gas contracts be awarded to a company that is seen or perceived to have more \u201clocal content\u201d than a \u201cforeign\u201d competitor. Additionally, the Nigerian Content Development Act allows the monitoring board to penalize companies that do not meet these local content requirements up to 5% of the value of the contract. Future unrest or legislation in Nigeria or our other operating regions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in those regions. We cannot predict whether any of these events will continue to occur in Nigeria or occur elsewhere in the future.\nWe are highly dependent upon the level of activity in the North Sea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which are mature exploration and production regions.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (Successor), the five months ended March 31, 2020 and seven months ended October 31, 2019, approximately 70%, 68% and 65%, respectively, of our gross revenue was derived from aviation services provided to oil and gas customers operating in the North Sea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The North Sea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are mature exploration and production regions that have undergone substantial seismic survey, exploration and production activity for many years. Because a large number of oil and gas properties in these regions have already been drilled, additional prospects of sufficient size and quality that make economic sense, especially in light of the depressed pricing in the energy market since 2014, could be more difficult to identify. The ability of our customers to produce sufficient quantities to support the costs of exploration in different basins could impact the level of future activity in these regions. Generally, the production from these drilled oil and gas properties is declining. In the future, production may decline to the point that such properties are no longer economic to operate, in which case, our services with respect to such properties will no longer be needed. Oil and gas companies may not identify sufficient additional drilling sites to replace those that become depleted. In addition, the U.S. government\u2019s exercise of authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, to restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases together with the U.K. government\u2019s exercise of authority could adversely impact exploration and production activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea, respectively. Further, actions of the Biden administration, such as the recently announced moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on U.S. federal lands, onshore and offshore, are likely to negatively impact oil and gas operations in the U.S. in and favor of renewable energy projects.\nIf activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in either the U.S. Gulf of Mexico or the North Sea materially declines, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot predict the levels of activity in these areas.\nWe are exposed to credit risk of our counterparties.\nWe are exposed to credit risk, which depends on the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligations to us. We manage credit risk by entering into arrangements with established counterparties and through the establishment of credit policies and limits, which are applied in the selection of counterparties.\nCredit risk arises from the potential for counterparties to default on their contractual obligations. We monitor our concentration risk with counterparties on an ongoing basis. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure for financial assets.\nCredit risk also arises on our trade receivables when a client cannot meet its obligation to us.. To mitigate trade credit risk, we have developed credit policies that include the review, approval and monitoring of new customers, annual credit evaluations and credit limits. There can be no assurance that our risk mitigation strategies will be effective and that credit risk will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the majority of our customers are engaged in oil and gas production, exploration and development. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (Successor), we generated approximately 72% of our consolidated operating revenue from oil and gas operations. This concentration could impact our overall exposure to credit risk because changes in economic and industry conditions that adversely affect the oil and gas industry could affect the credit worthiness of many of our customers. We generally do not require and do not have the leverage to obtain letters of credit or other collateral to support our trade receivables. Accordingly, a continued or additional downturn in the economic condition of the oil and gas industry could adversely impact our ability to collect our receivables and thus impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to dispose of aircraft through sales into the aftermarket could continue to adversely affect us.\nThe management of our global aircraft fleet involves a careful evaluation of the expected demand for our services across global markets, including the type of aircraft needed to meet this demand. As offshore oil and gas drilling and production globally moves to deeper water, more medium and heavy aircraft and newer technology aircraft may be required. As older aircraft models come off of current contracts and are replaced by new aircraft, our management evaluates our future needs for these aircraft models and ultimately the ability to recover our remaining investments in these aircraft through sales into the aftermarket. We depreciate our aircraft over their expected useful life to the expected salvage value to be received for the\naircraft at the end of that life. However, depending on the market for an aircraft type when we seek to sell an aircraft or anticipate disposing of an aircraft, we may record gains or losses on aircraft sales or impairment. In certain instances where a cash return can be made on newer aircraft in excess of the expected return available through the provision of our services, we may sell newer aircraft. The number of aircraft sales and the amount of gains and losses recorded on these sales depends on a wide variety of factors and is inherently unpredictable. A significant return of aircraft to leasing companies by us or our competitors into an already oversupplied market could undermine our ability to dispose of our aircraft and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nForeign exchange risks and controls may affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThrough our operations outside the U.S., we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks. As a result, a strong U.S. dollar may increase the local cost of our services that are provided under U.S. dollar-denominated contracts, which may reduce the demand for our services in foreign countries.\nBecause we maintain our financial statements in U.S. dollars, our financial results are vulnerable to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, such as the British pound sterling, Australian dollar, euro, Norwegian krone and Nigerian naira. In preparing our financial statements, we must convert all non-U.S. dollar results to U.S. dollars. The effect of foreign currency translation impacts our results of operations as a result of the translation of non-U.S. dollar results and is reflected as a component of stockholders\u2019 investment, while the revaluation of certain monetary foreign currency transactions is credited or charged to income and reflected in other income (expense), net.\nWe operate in countries with foreign exchange controls including Brazil and Nigeria. These controls may limit our ability to repatriate funds from our international operations and unconsolidated affiliates or otherwise convert local currencies into U.S. dollars. These limitations could adversely affect our ability to access cash from these operations.\nOur dependence on a small number of helicopter manufacturers and lessors poses a significant risk to our business and prospects, including when we seek to grow our business.\nWe contract with a small number of manufacturers and lessors for most of our aircraft expansion, replacement and leasing needs. If any of the manufacturers face production delays due to, for example, natural disasters, pandemics, labor strikes or availability of skilled labor, we may experience a significant delay in the delivery of previously ordered aircraft. During these periods, we may not be able to obtain orders for additional aircraft with acceptable pricing, delivery dates or other terms. Also, we have operating leases for many of our helicopters. The number of companies that provide leasing for helicopters is limited. If any of these leasing companies face financial setbacks, we may experience delays or restrictions in our ability to lease aircraft.\nDelivery delays or our inability to obtain acceptable aircraft orders or lease aircraft have from time to time adversely affected, and could adversely affect in the future, our revenue and profitability and could jeopardize our ability to meet the demands of our customers and grow our business.\nA shortfall in availability of aircraft components and parts required for maintenance and repairs of our helicopter and fixed wing aircraft and supplier cost increases could adversely affect us.\nIn connection with the required maintenance and repairs performed on our aircraft in order for them to stay fully operational and available for use in our operations, we rely on a few key vendors (such as Sikorsky Commercial Inc., Milestone Aviation Group, General Electric Aviation Inc. and Leonardo SpA) for the supply and overhaul of components fitted to our aircraft. These vendors have historically worked at or near full capacity supporting the aircraft production lines and the maintenance requirements of various government and civilian aircraft operators that may also operate at or near capacity in certain industries, including operators such as us who support the energy industry. Such conditions can result in backlogs in manufacturing schedules and some parts being in limited supply from time to time, which could have an adverse impact upon our ability to maintain and repair our aircraft. To the extent that these suppliers also supply parts for aircraft used by governments in military operations, parts delivery for our aircraft may be delayed in favor of those deliveries. Our inability to perform timely maintenance and repairs can result in our aircraft being underutilized, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, our operations in remote locations, where delivery of these components and parts could take a significant period of time, may also impact our ability to maintain and repair our aircraft. While every effort is made to mitigate such impact, this may pose a risk to our operating results. Additionally, supplier cost\nincreases for critical aircraft components and parts also pose a risk to our operating results. As certain of our contracts are long-term in nature, cost increases may not be able to be passed on to our customers until the contracts are up for renewal.\nAdditionally, operation of a global fleet of aircraft requires us to carry spare parts inventory across our global operations to perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance activity. Changes in the aircraft model types of our fleet or the timing of exits from model types can result in inventory levels in excess of those required to support the fleet over the remaining life of the fleet. Additionally, other parts may become obsolete or dormant given changes in use of parts on aircraft and maintenance needs. These fleet changes or other external factors can result in impairment of inventory balances where we expect that excess, dormant or obsolete inventory will not recover its carrying value through sales to third parties or disposal.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to grow in core markets and expand into new business lines and international markets.\nOur future growth will depend on our ability to grow in our core markets and expand into new business lines, such as offshore wind and advanced air mobility, and new international markets. Expansion of our business depends on our ability to operate in these other regions.\nExpansion of our business may be adversely affected by:\n\u2022local regulations restricting foreign ownership of helicopter operators;\n\u2022requirements to award contracts to local operators; and\n\u2022the number and location of new drilling concessions granted by foreign governments.\nIf we are unable to continue to operate or retain contracts in international markets, our operations may not grow, and our future business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nLabor problems could adversely affect us.\nMany of our employees are represented under collective bargaining or union agreements, some of which have expired or will expire in one year or less. Disputes over the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with the unions that represent our employees under these agreements could result in strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers. Periodically, certain groups of our employees who are not covered under a collective bargaining agreement consider entering into such an agreement. Further, if our unionized workers engage in an extended strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, other employees elect to become unionized, existing labor agreements are renegotiated or future labor agreements contain terms that are unfavorable to us, we could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to weather-related and seasonal fluctuations.\nCertain of our operations are subject to harsh weather conditions and seasonal factors. Poor visibility, high wind, heavy precipitation, sandstorms and volcanic ash can affect the operation of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and result in a reduced number of flight hours. A significant portion of our operating revenues and profits related to oil and gas exploration, development and production activity is dependent on actual flight hours, and a substantial portion of our operating expenses is fixed. Thus, prolonged periods of harsh weather can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, severe weather patterns, including those resulting from climate change, could affect the operation of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and result in a reduced number of flight hours, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe fall and winter months in the Northern hemisphere have fewer hours of daylight, particularly in the North Sea and Canada, and flight hours are generally lower at these times, typically resulting in a reduction in operating revenue during those months. Although some of our helicopters are equipped to fly at night, we generally do not do so except in SAR operations. In addition, drilling activity in the North Sea and Canada is less active during the winter months than the rest of the year. Anticipation of harsh weather during this period causes many oil and gas companies to limit activity during the winter months. Accordingly, our reduced ability to operate in harsh weather conditions and darkness may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Harmattan, a dry and dusty West African trade wind, blows in Nigeria between the end of December and the middle of February. The heavy amount of dust in the air can severely limit visibility and block the sun for several days, similar to a heavy fog. We are unable to operate aircraft during these harsh conditions.\nIn the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the months of December through March typically have more days of harsh weather conditions than the other months of the year. Heavy fog during those months often limits visibility and flight activity. In addition, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, June through November is tropical storm and hurricane season, and in the Asia Pacific region, operations may be impacted by cyclones from November through April. During a tropical storm, hurricane or cyclone, we are unable to operate in the area of the storm. However, flight activity may increase immediately before and after a storm due to the evacuation and return of offshore workers. In addition, as a significant portion of our facilities are located along the coast of these regions, extreme weather may cause substantial damage to our property in these locations, including possibly aircraft. Additionally, we incur costs in evacuating our aircraft, personnel and equipment prior to tropical storms, hurricanes and cyclones.\nConsequently, flight hours may be lower during these periods, resulting in reduced operating revenue, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Customers and Contracts\nA focus by our customers on cost-saving measures rather than quality of service, which is how we differentiate ourselves from competition, could reduce the demand for our services.\nHistorically, we had the ability to secure profitable contracts by providing superior quality as compared to our competitors. However, offshore energy companies are continually seeking to implement measures aimed at greater cost savings, including efforts to accept lesser quality services, otherwise improve cost efficiencies with respect to air transportation services, or to provide other alternatives for transportation, such as boats. For example, these companies may reduce staffing levels on both old and new installations by using new technology to permit unmanned installations, may reduce the frequency of transportation of employees by increasing the length of shifts offshore, may change other aspects of how our services are scheduled and may consider other alternatives to our services to achieve cost savings. In addition, these companies could initiate their own helicopter, airplane or other transportation alternatives. The continued implementation of these kinds of measures could reduce the demand or pricing for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition.\nThe helicopter and fixed wing businesses are highly competitive throughout the world. Chartering of such aircraft is often done on the basis of competitive bidding among those providers having the necessary equipment, operational experience and resources. Factors that affect competition in our industry include price, quality of service, operational experience, record of safety, quality and type of equipment, aircraft availability, client relationship and professional reputation.\nOur industry has historically been cyclical and is affected by the volatility of oil and gas price levels. There have been periods of high demand for our services, followed by periods of low demand for our services. Changes in commodity prices can have a significant effect on demand for our services, and periods of low activity intensify price competition in the industry and often result in our aircraft being idle for long periods of time.\nWe have several significant competitors in the North Sea, Nigeria, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Brazil, and a number of smaller local competitors in other markets. Certain of our customers have the capability to perform their own air transportation operations or give business to our competitors should they elect to do so, which has a limiting effect on our rates.\nAs a result of significant competition, we must continue to provide safe and efficient service and we must continue to evolve our technology or we will lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations due to the loss of a significant number of our customers or termination of a significant number of our contracts.\nWe depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from our U.K. SAR contract, as well as from a small number of offshore energy companies. Our loss of one of these significant customers, if not offset by sales to new or other existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See discussion of our customers and contractual arrangements in the \u201cBusiness\u201d section of this Annual Report.\nOur contracts often can be terminated or downsized by our customers without penalty.\nMany of our fixed-term contracts contain provisions permitting early termination by the client at their convenience, generally without penalty, and with limited notice requirements. In addition, many of our contracts permit our customers to decrease the number of aircraft under contract with a corresponding decrease in the fixed monthly payments without penalty. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on the strength of our client contracts or the terms of those contracts.\nOur U.K. SAR contract can be terminated and is subject to certain other rights of the DfT.\nOur U.K. SAR contract, which accounted for approximately 20% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (Successor), allows the DfT to cancel the contract for any reason upon notice and payment of a specified cancellation fee based on the number of bases reduced as a result of the exercise and the timing of the exercise. Prior to any cancellation or termination of the contract, the DfT may also invite tenders to award a contract for the SAR services we provide to a replacement contractor. The DfT has invited tenders due in the summer of 2021 for these services following the expiration of our current U.K. SAR contract in 2026.\nAdditionally, the U.K. SAR contract grants the DfT the option to require us to transfer to the DfT, at termination or expiration, either the lease or the ownership of some or all of the helicopters and ground facilities that service the U.K. SAR contract. The DfT may alternatively require that we or the owner, as the case may be, transfer the lease or ownership of the helicopters and ground facilities to any replacement service provider. If the DfT wishes to transfer ownership, it must pay a specified option exercise fee based on the value of the helicopters. If the DfT wishes to transfer the lease, it does not have to pay an option exercise fee. We currently lease a significant number of the aircraft that service the U.K. SAR contract. Although we are entitled to some compensation for termination or early expiration if we are not at fault, termination or early expiration of the U.K. SAR contract would result in a significant loss of expected revenue. Additionally, we do not have the right to cause the transfer of the ground facilities supporting the U.K. SAR contract to the replacement service provider. If alternative long-term uses were not identified for these facilities, we could incur recurring fixed expenses for these non-revenue producing assets if we were unable to sell them to a replacement contractor or other party in the event the U.K. SAR contract is terminated.\nOur customers may shift risk to us.\nWe give to and receive from our customers indemnities relating to damages caused or sustained by us in connection with our operations. Our customers often seek to capitalize on their market leverage to shift responsibility for risk. In difficult markets, we may be obliged to accept greater risk to win new business, retain renewing business or could result in us losing business if we are not prepared to take such risks. To the extent that we accept such additional risk, and seek to insure against it, if possible, our insurance premiums could rise. If we cannot insure against such risks or otherwise choose not to do so, we could be exposed to catastrophic losses in the event such risks are realized.\nReductions in spending on aviation services by governmental agencies could lead to modifications of contract terms or delays in receiving payments, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur U.K. SAR contract and U.S. governmental agencies, consisting primarily of the BSEE contract, accounted for approximately 21% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (Successor).\nGovernmental agencies receive funding through budget appropriations, which are determined through the political process, and as a result, funding for the agencies with which we do business may fluctuate. In recent years, there has been increased Congressional scrutiny of discretionary program spending by the U.S. government in light of concerns over the size of the national debt and lawmakers have discussed the need to cut or impose caps on discretionary spending, which could result in budget cuts to federal agencies to which we provide services. If any agencies experience reductions in their budgets or if the Government changes its spending or service priorities, it may substantially reduce or cease using our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a prolonged shutdown of the federal government would, in turn, cause a shutdown of these agencies which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFurther, any reductions in the budgets of governmental agencies for spending on aviation services, implementation of cost saving measures by governmental agencies, including the DfT and the BSEE, imposed modifications of contract terms or delays in collecting receivables owed to us by our governmental agency customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, there are inherent risks in contracting with governmental agencies. Applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate may enable our governmental agency customers to (i) terminate contracts for convenience, (ii) reduce, modify or cancel contracts or subcontracts if requirements or budgetary constraints change, (iii) terminate contracts or adjust their terms or (iv) require contractors to assume more risk under the terms of the contracts. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur fixed operating expenses and long-term contracts with customers could adversely affect our business under certain circumstances.\nOur profitability is directly related to demand for our services. Because of the significant expenses related to aircraft financing and leasing, crew wages and benefits and insurance and maintenance programs, a substantial portion of our operating expenses are fixed and must be paid even when aircraft are not actively servicing customers and thereby generating revenue. A decrease in our revenue could therefore result in a disproportionate decrease in our earnings, as a substantial portion of our operating expense would remain unchanged. Similarly, the discontinuation of any rebates, discounts or preferential financing terms offered to us by manufacturers, lenders or lessors could have the effect of increasing our related expenses, and without a corresponding increase in our revenue, could negatively impact our results of operations.\nCertain of our long-term aircraft services contracts contain price escalation terms and conditions. Although supplier costs, fuel costs, insurance costs and other cost increases are typically passed through to our customers through rate increases where possible, these escalations may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup increased costs in full and we may not be able to realize the full benefit of contract price escalations during a market downturn. There can be no assurance that we will be able to estimate costs accurately or recover increased costs by passing these costs on to our customers. We may not be successful in identifying or securing cost escalations for other costs that may escalate during the applicable client contract term. In the event that we are unable to fully recover material costs that escalate during the terms of our client contracts, the profitability of our client contracts and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and negatively affected.\nConsolidation of and asset sales by, our customer base could materially adversely affect demand for our services and reduce our revenues.\nMany of our customers are international, independent and major integrated oil and gas exploration, development and production companies and offshore energy companies. In recent years, these companies have undergone substantial consolidation and engaged in sales of specific assets. Additional consolidation and asset sales are possible. In addition, since 2014 there have been a significant number of bankruptcy filings, with related consolidations and asset sales in the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry. Consolidation shrinks our customer base. In the event one of our customers combines with, or sells assets to, a company that is using the services of one of our competitors, the combined or successor company could decide to use the services of that competitor or another provider. Further, merger activity among both major and independent oil and natural gas companies affects exploration, development and production activity as the consolidated companies often put projects on hold while integrating operations or cancel projects deemed too small in context of a larger business or use cost savings to reduce debts.\nReductions in the budgets of oil and gas companies could adversely affect demand for our services that could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Gas Industry\nThe demand for our services is substantially dependent on the level of offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production activity.\nWe provide helicopter and fixed wing services to companies engaged in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production activities. As a result, demand for our services, as well as our revenue and our profitability, are substantially dependent on the worldwide levels of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production. These activity levels are principally affected by trends in, and expectations regarding, oil and natural gas prices, as well as the capital expenditure budgets of offshore energy companies and shifts in technology for energy exploration, development and production. The increase in U.S. onshore production in recent years resulting from onshore hydraulic fracturing activity and shale development has had a negative impact on the price of oil and provided a competitive investment opportunity for capital, reduced thereby the demand for our services. We cannot predict future exploration, development and production activity or oil and gas price movements. Historically, the prices for oil and gas and activity levels have been volatile and are subject to factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022the supply of and demand for oil and gas and market expectations for such supply and demand;\n\u2022actions of OPEC+ to control prices or change production levels;\n\u2022increased supply of oil and gas resulting from onshore hydraulic fracturing activity and shale development;\n\u2022general economic conditions, both worldwide and in particular regions;\n\u2022governmental regulation;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022weather conditions, including the impact of hurricanes and other weather-related phenomena;\n\u2022advances in exploration, development and production technology;\n\u2022the changing environmental and social landscape;\n\u2022the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves; and\n\u2022the worldwide political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in the Middle East, Nigeria or other geographic areas, or further acts of terrorism in the U.K., U.S. or elsewhere.\nSo far in 2021, although oil and gas prices have recovered somewhat, there is new uncertainty regarding the long-term outlook for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as a result of the indefinite moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on U.S. federal lands imposed by the Biden administration.\nUnconventional crude oil and natural gas sources and improved economics of producing natural gas and oil from such sources have exerted and could continue to exert downward pricing pressures.\nThe level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production is affected by the relative economics of and resultant level of activity in land-based oil and gas exploration, development and production. In recent years, there has been a significant focus on and increase in production from land-based North American shale reservoirs, which has been facilitated by hydraulic fracturing and other technologies. The availability of more economical oil and gas reserves, including, if applicable, land-based North American shale reservoirs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny significant development impacting deepwater drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could materially adversely affect us.\nWe are highly dependent on offshore oil and gas activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As a result of the well-publicized sinking of the Deepwater Horizon, a semi-submersible deepwater drilling rig operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico after an apparent blowout and fire resulting in a significant flow of hydrocarbons from the BP Plc. Macondo well, the U.S. Department of Interior temporarily imposed a moratorium on offshore drilling operations and issued new rules designed to improve drilling and workplace safety in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. While the moratorium was quickly lifted, the BSEE, the Office of National Resources Revenue and other regulatory agencies may issue new safety and environmental guidelines and regulations for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other geographic regions, the result of which may increase the costs and regulatory burden of exploration, development and production, reduce the area of operations for offshore oil and gas activities and result in permitting delays. It is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of any new guidelines, regulations or legislation that may be implemented, including in response to the Biden administration\u2019s executive orders and policies. A prolonged suspension of drilling activity or permitting delays in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other geographic locations in which we operate, new regulations and/or increased liability for companies operating in the offshore oil and gas sector, whether or not caused by a new incident in any region, could result in reduced demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, actions of the Biden administration, such as the moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on U.S. federal lands, onshore and offshore, are likely to negatively impact oil and gas operations and favor renewable energy projects in the U.S., in turn negatively impacting the demand for our services.\nRisks Related to Legal, Tax and Regulatory Matters\nWe operate in many international areas through entities that we do not control and are subject to government regulation that limits foreign ownership of aircraft companies in favor of domestic ownership.\nWe conduct many of our international operations through entities in which we have a noncontrolling investment or through strategic alliances with foreign partners. For example, we have acquired interests in, or in some cases have lease and service agreements with, entities that operate aircraft in Canada and Egypt. We provide engineering and administrative support to certain of these entities. We derive significant amounts of lease revenue, service revenue, equity earnings and dividend income from these entities. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (Successor), the five months ended March 31, 2020 (Successor) and the seven months ended October 31, 2019 (Predecessor), we received approximately $42.4 million, $23.3 million and $30.6 million, respectively, of revenue from the provision of aircraft and other services to unconsolidated affiliates. As a result of not owning a majority interest or maintaining voting control of our unconsolidated affiliates, we do not have the ability to control their policies, management or affairs. The interests of persons who control these entities or partners may differ from ours and may cause such entities to take actions that are not in our best interest. Certain of our co-owners of these entities have the right to require us to purchase their interest in which case we would need to find a qualifying person to hold the interest. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation\u201d for additional information. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with our partners in these entities, we could lose our ability to operate in these areas, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, an operational incident involving one of the entities over which we do not have operational control may nevertheless cause us reputational harm.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation that limits foreign ownership of aircraft companies in favor of domestic ownership. Based on regulations in various markets in which we operate, the use of our local Air Operator\u2019s Certificates (\u201cAOCs\u201d) may be halted and we may lose our ability to operate within these countries if certain levels of local ownership are not maintained. The inability to utilize our local AOCs for any reason, including foreign ownership in excess of permitted\nlevels, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct operations within these markets. We cannot assure you that there will be no changes in aviation laws, regulations or administrative requirements or the interpretations or applications thereof that could restrict or prohibit our ability to operate in certain regions or that would cause the cost of operating in the region uneconomical. Any such restriction or prohibition on our ability to operate in non-US jurisdictions or any significant increase in cost operating in such jurisdictions as a result of changes in law and regulation or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental regulations and liabilities may increase our costs and adversely affect us.\nOur operations are subject to U.S. federal, state and local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment, storage, recycling and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes. The nature of the business of operating and maintaining aircraft requires that we use, store and dispose of materials that are subject to environmental regulation. Environmental laws and regulations change frequently, which makes it impossible for us to predict their cost or impact on our future operations. Liabilities associated with environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could be exposed to strict, joint and several liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Additionally, any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking action against us that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including the:\n\u2022issuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n\u2022imposition of limitations on our operations; and\n\u2022performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.\nIn January 2021, the Biden administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and any similar agency actions promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the current administration\u2019s policies. Also in January 2021, the Biden administration issued an executive order focused on addressing climate change. Among other things, the executive order called for the elimination of certain subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, increased emphasis on climate-related risk across governmental agencies and economic sectors and directed the Secretary of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. Additionally, in January 2021, the Biden administration issued executive orders recommitting the U.S. to the Paris Agreement. The prior administration had withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Agreement. The impacts of these orders and the terms of any legislation or regulation to implement the United States\u2019 commitment under the Paris Agreement remain unclear at this time.\nAdditional changes in environmental laws or regulations, including laws relating to the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases or other climate change concerns, could require us to devote capital or other resources to comply with those laws and regulations. These changes could also subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased fuel costs. In addition, such changes in laws or regulations could increase costs of compliance and doing business for our customers and thereby decrease the demand for our services. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and gas or limit drilling opportunities.\nOur results could be impacted by U.S. and foreign social, political, regulatory and economic conditions as well as by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. government.\nChanges in U.S. political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade (including the U.S. trade agreements and U.S. tariff policies), travel to and from the U.S., immigration, manufacturing, development and\ninvestment in the territories and countries in which we operate, and any negative sentiments or retaliatory actions towards the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect the industry, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects. Given the change in the U.S. presidential administration, we face uncertainty with regard to U.S. government trade policy.\nThe presidential administration under former President Trump, along with Congress, created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and other countries with respect to the trade policies, treaties, taxes, government regulations and tariffs that would be applicable. It is unclear what changes, if any, might be considered or implemented and what response to any such changes may be by the governments of other countries. These changes have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and China, as well as other countries, including with respect to the trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs that could apply to trade between the U.S. and other nations. Changes in these policies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the consequences of Brexit may also cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting economy and oil and gas prices as well as our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees.\nWe are subject to legal compliance risks, including anti-corruption statutes, the violation of which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including import and export controls, the payment of taxes, employment and labor relations, fair competition, data privacy protections, securities regulation, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, economic sanctions and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. A failure to comply could also result in significant fines, damages and other criminal sanctions against us, our officers, employees, joint venture partners or strategic partners, prohibitions or additional requirements on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Further, we could be charged with wrongdoing for any violation of such laws and regulations by our agents, local partners or joint ventures, even though such parties may not be subject to the applicable statutes or may not operate under our control. Failure by us or one of our agents, joint ventures or strategic partners to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges. Certain violations of law could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracts. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global regulations and the changes in laws or regulations and related interpretations and other guidance could result in higher expenses and payments. Uncertainty relating to such laws or regulations, including how they affect a business or how we are required to comply with the laws, may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights.\nIn many foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies, it may be customary for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and the BCCA in Brazil, an anti-bribery law that is similar to the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, agents and business partners will not take action in violation of our internal policies and applicable law and any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActions taken by governmental agencies, such as the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation and the FAA, and similar agencies in the other jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase our costs and prohibit or reduce our ability to operate successfully.\nOur industry is regulated by various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The scope of such regulation includes infrastructure and operational issues relating to helicopters, maintenance, spare parts and route flying rights as well as safety and security requirements. We cannot fully anticipate all changes that might be made to the laws and regulations to which we are subject or the possible impact of such changes. These changes could subject us to additional costs and restrictions.\nU.S. Our operations are highly regulated by several U.S. government regulatory agencies. For example, as a certified air carrier, we are subject to regulations promulgated by the DOT and the FAA. The FAA regulates our flight operations and imposes requirements with respect to personnel, aircraft, ground facilities and other aspects of our operations, including:\n\u2022certification and reporting requirements;\n\u2022inspections;\n\u2022maintenance standards;\n\u2022permitted areas of operation;\n\u2022aircraft equipment and modification requirements;\n\u2022personnel training standards; and\n\u2022maintenance of personnel and aircraft records.\nThe DOT can review our economic fitness to continue our operations, both presently and if a substantial change occurs to our management, ownership or capital structure, among other things. The Department of Commerce, through its International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d), regulates our imports and exports of aircraft (through leases and sales) as well as parts sales to international customers and the use of certain regulated technology in domestic and international airspace. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, or if these agencies develop concerns over our operations, we could face administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties. In addition, we may become subject to regulatory actions that could suspend, curtail or significantly modify our operations. A suspension or substantial curtailment of our operations or any substantial modification of our current operations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther Countries and Regulations. Our operations in other jurisdictions, including the U.K., Nigeria and Brazil, are regulated to various degrees by the governments of such jurisdictions and must be conducted in compliance with those regulations and, where applicable, in accordance with our air service licenses and AOCs. Such regulations may require us to obtain a license to operate in that country, favor local companies or require operating permits that can only be obtained by locally registered companies and often impose other nationality requirements. In such cases, we partner with local persons, but there is no assurance regarding which foreign governmental regulations may be applicable in the future to our helicopter operations and whether we would be able to comply with them.\nThe revocation of any of the licenses discussed above or the termination of any of our relationships with local parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in effective tax rates, taxation of our foreign subsidiaries or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, both domestically and internationally, or the interpretation or application thereof. From time to time, the U.S. Congress and foreign, state and local governments consider legislation that could increase our effective tax rate or the effective tax rates of our consolidated affiliates. President Biden previously provided informal guidance on certain tax law changes that he would support. Among other things, his proposals would raise the rate on both domestic and foreign income and impose a new alternative minimum tax on book income. We cannot determine whether, or in what form, legislation will ultimately be enacted or what the impact of any such legislation could have on our profitability. If these or other changes to tax laws are enacted, our profitability could be negatively impacted.\nOur future effective tax rates could also be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, the ultimate repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S., or by changes in tax treaties, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof in one or more countries in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to the potential examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities where we file tax returns. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nThere can be no assurance that such examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding data privacy and protection is constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. Laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs. The U.K. may enact data privacy laws similar to the GDPR following Brexit, in order to maintain harmony with GDPR requirements, but this is not yet settled. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance and adversely affect our business. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of cyber incidents or attacks, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Corporate Structure\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u2022market conditions in the broader stock market;\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19;\n\u2022commodity prices, including oil and gas prices and the perceived level of offshore oil and gas activities;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our and our competitors\u2019 quarterly financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022introduction of new equipment or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022grounding of all or a portion of our fleet;\n\u2022issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations or a lack of coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022policies of investors, including pension funds, to divest investments in the oil and gas sector based on their environmental and social considerations;\n\u2022sales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our common stock;\n\u2022business or asset acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022regulatory or political developments, including those related to budget appropriations;\n\u2022litigation and governmental investigations;\n\u2022technical factors in the public trading market for our stock that may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock and any related hedging and other technical trading factors; and\n\u2022changing economic conditions.\nThe market for our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations similar to those experienced by the broader stock market in recent years.\nGenerally, the fluctuations experienced by the broader stock market have affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, our announcements of our quarterly operating results, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us, our affiliates or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nSecurities analyst coverage or lack of coverage may have a negative impact on our stock price. If securities analysts or industry analysts downgrade our common stock, publish negative research or reports or fail to publish reports about our business, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business and our market. If one or more analysts adversely change their recommendation regarding our common stock or our competitors\u2019 stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover the Company downgrades our common stock, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in our management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation (\u201ccertificate of incorporation\u201d) and amended and restated bylaws (\u201cbylaws\u201d) include certain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company or changes in our management. Such provisions include, among other things:\n\u2022restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to fill a vacancy on the Board;\n\u2022restrictions related to the ability of non-U.S. citizens owning our common stock;\n\u2022our ability to issue preferred stock with terms that the Board may determine, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022the absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors, which may limit the ability of minority stockholders to elect directors; and\n\u2022advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from soliciting proxies to elect a particular slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nThese provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company that is in the best interest of our stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may materially adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nRegulations limit foreign ownership of the Company, which could reduce the price of our common stock and cause owners of our common stock who are not U.S. persons to lose their voting rights.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that persons or entities that are not \u201ccitizens of the U.S.\u201d (as defined in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the \u201cFederal Aviation Act\u201d)) shall not collectively own or control more than 25% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock (the \u201cPermitted Foreign Ownership Percentage\u201d) and that, if at any time persons that are not citizens of the U.S. nevertheless collectively own or control more than the Permitted Foreign Ownership Percentage, the voting rights of our outstanding voting capital stock in excess of the Permitted Foreign Ownership Percentage owned by stockholders who are not citizens of the U.S. shall automatically be reduced. These voting rights will be reduced pro rata among the holders of voting shares who are not citizens of the U.S. to equal the Permitted Foreign Ownership Percentage based on the number of votes to which the underlying voting securities are entitled. Shares held by persons who are not citizens of the U.S. may lose their associated voting rights and be redeemed as a result of these provisions. Accordingly, in the event of any vote by our stockholders, the voting rights of shares held by non-U.S. citizens would be reduced pursuant to our organizational documents if such ownership remains above 25% of our total outstanding common stock at the time of such vote. These restrictions may also have a material adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of our common stock because\nstockholders may be unable to transfer our common stock to persons who are not citizens of the U.S. and because persons who are not citizens of the U.S. may be unable or unwilling to hold shares of our common stock the voting rights of which have been reduced.\nOur certificate of incorporation includes a forum selection clause, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur certificate of incorporation requires that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This forum selection provision in our certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us, which may discourage such lawsuits against us. It is also possible that, notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in our certificate of incorporation, a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, in which case we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.\nGeneral Risks\nCovenants in our debt agreements may restrict the manner in which we can operate our business.\nThe indenture governing the 6.875% Senior Notes limits, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022Borrow money or issue guarantees;\n\u2022pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022incur liens to secure indebtedness;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022sell certain assets;\n\u2022enter into transactions with our affiliates; or\n\u2022merge with another entity or sell substantially all of our assets.\nIf we fail to comply with these and other covenants, we would be in default under the Lombard Debt and the ABL Facility (together, our \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d) and the indenture governing the 6.875% Senior Notes, and the principal and accrued interest on our outstanding indebtedness may become due and payable. In addition, our Credit Facilities and other debt agreements contain, and our future debt agreements may contain, similar and additional affirmative and negative covenants. Our Credit Facilities and the 6.875% Senior Notes are secured by many of our assets (including most of our helicopters), and such assets may not be available to secure additional financings. As a result, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be significantly restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us.\nOur debt agreements, including our Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the 6.875% Senior Notes, also require us or certain of our subsidiaries, and our future credit facilities may require us or certain of our subsidiaries, to observe certain covenants. Our ability to observe certain of those covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to observe these covenants in the future. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our other debt agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our Credit Facilities, any future credit facilities or the indenture governing the 6.875% Senior Notes, our creditors could elect to declare some or all amounts outstanding thereunder, including accrued interest or other obligations, to be immediately due and payable. There can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay all of our indebtedness in full.\nThe agreements governing certain of our indebtedness, including our Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the 6.875% Senior Notes contain cross-default provisions. Under these provisions, a default under one agreement governing our indebtedness may constitute a default under our other debt agreements.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on us.\nLoss of the services of key management personnel at our corporate and regional headquarters without being able to attract personnel of equal ability could have a material adverse effect upon us. Further, Title 49-Transportation of the United States Code of Federal Regulations and other statutes require our President and two-thirds of the Board and other managing officers be U.S. citizens. Our failure to attract and retain qualified executive personnel or for such executive personnel to work well together or as effective leaders in their respective areas of responsibility could have a material adverse effect on our current business and future growth.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified pilots, mechanics and other highly trained personnel is an important factor in determining our future success. For example, many of our customers require pilots with very high levels of flight experience. The market for these experienced and highly-trained personnel is competitive and may become more competitive. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain such personnel. Some of our pilots, mechanics and other personnel, as well as those of our competitors, are members of military reserves who have been, or could be, called to active duty. If significant numbers of such personnel are called to active duty, it could reduce the supply of such workers and likely increase our labor costs. Additionally, the addition of new aircraft types to our fleet or a sudden change in demand for a specific aircraft type, as happened with the Sikorsky S-92 aircraft type in response to the H225 grounding, may require us to retain additional pilots, mechanics and other flight-related personnel.\nBrexit could adversely affect us.\nIn Europe, political uncertainty has created financial, legal and economic uncertainty, most recently as a result of Brexit. The U.K. formally exited the E.U. on January 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and E.U. agreed to a trade deal (the \u201cTrade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d), which was ratified by the U.K. on December 30, 2020. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement is subject to formal approval by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union before it comes into effect and has been applied provisionally since January 1, 2021. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement allows the U.K and E.U. to continue trading without tariffs or quotas; however, the movement of goods between the U.K. and the remaining member states of the E.U. may be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks. In addition, there are still a number of areas of uncertainty in connection with the future of the U.K. and its relationship with the E.U. and the application and interpretation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, and Brexit-related matters may take several years to be clarified and resolved. In particular, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement only covers the trade of goods and, therefore, uncertainly remains over the U.K.\u2019s long-term trading of services relationship with the E.U. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of Brexit on our business. However, the economic consequences of Brexit, including the possible repeal of open-skies agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, many of the structural issues facing the E.U. following the global financial crisis of 2008 remain (some of which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic), and problems could resurface that could affect market conditions and, possibly, our business, financial results and liquidity, particularly if they lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European Monetary Union (the \u201cEMU\u201d) or the exit of additional countries from the E.U. If one or more countries exited the EMU, there would be significant uncertainty with respect to outstanding obligations of counterparties and debtors in any exiting country, whether sovereign or otherwise, and it would likely lead to complex and lengthy disputes and litigation. Additionally, it is possible that political events in Europe could lead to the complete dissolution of the EMU or E.U. The partial or full breakup of the EMU or E.U. would be unprecedented and its impact highly uncertain, including with respect to Bristow\u2019s business, financial results and liquidity.\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently subject to and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of merit, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and could cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention.\nWe may face significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially adversely affect a portion of our business operations or materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations should we not prevail in certain matters.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions, data corruption, cyberattacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted and our business could be negatively impacted.\nOur business is increasingly dependent upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, to capture knowledge of our business, and to communicate within the Company and with customers, suppliers, partners and other stakeholders. These information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyberattacks, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Our information technology systems are becoming increasingly integrated on a global basis, so damage, disruption or shutdown to the system could result in a more widespread impact. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business disruptions and transaction errors causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, a breach or failure of our information technology systems could lead to potential unauthorized access and disclosure of confidential information, including the personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, or violations of privacy or other laws. Any such breach could also lead to data loss, data corruption, communication interruption or other operational disruptions within our business. There is no assurance that we will not experience cyberattacks or security breaches and suffer losses in the future. As the methods of cyberattacks or security breaches continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any such event. Furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks and security breaches has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention. To the extent we are subject to increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend additional resources to meet such requirements.\nIf we identify material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. For a discussion of the material weakness and our remediation efforts, see Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.\nFailure to develop or implement new technologies could affect our results of operations.\nMany of the aircraft that we operate are characterized by changing technology, introductions and enhancements of models of aircraft and services and shifting client demands, including technology preferences. Our future growth and financial performance will depend in part upon our ability to develop, market and integrate new services and to accommodate the latest technological advances and client preferences. In addition, the introduction of new technologies or services that compete with our services could result in our revenue decreasing over time. If we are unable to upgrade our operations or fleet with the latest technological advances in a timely manner, or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business, financial results or stock price.\nIn recent years, increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters in public discourse and the investment community. A number of advocacy groups, both domestically and internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to promote change at public companies related to ESG matters, including through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers, proxy advisory firms, public pension funds, universities and other members of the investing community. These activities include increasing attention and demands for action related to climate change, promoting the use of substitutes to fossil fuel products and encouraging the divestment of companies in the oil and gas industry. These activities are especially relevant to us in light of our participation in the energy industry and therefore could reduce demand for our services, reduce our profits, increase the potential for investigations and litigation, impair our brand and have negative impacts on the price of our common stock and access to capital markets.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. These ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact us.\nMedia coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by us, our unconsolidated affiliates or other companies in our industry, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation or governmental investigations by regulators. Specifically, accidents involving any aircraft operated by us or a third-party operator could cause substantial adverse publicity affecting us specifically or our industry generally and could lead to the perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable.\nAddressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on our reputation, the morale of our employees and the willingness of passengers to fly on our aircraft and those of our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 59089, "SIC": 4522, "TIC": "VTOL"}
