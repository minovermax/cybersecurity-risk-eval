{"cik": "1412665", "company": "MidWestOne Financial Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nEconomic and Market Risks\nOur business is concentrated in and largely dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of the Iowa and Minneapolis/St. Paul markets.\nWe operate primarily in the central and eastern Iowa and Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota markets and their surrounding communities in the upper-Midwest. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in the economic conditions in those areas. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in these markets. Although our customers\u2019 businesses and financial interests may extend well beyond these market areas, adverse economic conditions that affect these market areas could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us, affect the value of collateral underlying loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; uncertainty in U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs; natural disasters; acts of war or terrorism; widespread disease or pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors. Because of our geographic concentration, we are less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has led to an economic recession and had other adverse effects on the U.S. economy and has disrupted our operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely impacted certain industries in which our clients operate and impaired their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to us. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain but may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact the United States and the world. The spread of COVID-19 has negatively impacted the U.S. economy at large, and small businesses in particular, and has affected our operations. The responses on the part of the U.S. and global governments and populations have created a recessionary environment, reduced economic activity and caused significant volatility in the global stock markets. We have experienced significant disruptions across our business due to these effects, which may in future periods lead to decreased earnings, significant loan defaults and slowdowns in our loan collections. We expect increased unemployment and recessionary concerns will adversely affect mortgage originations and loan revenue in future periods. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain but may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a decline in the businesses of certain of our clients, a decrease in consumer confidence, an increase in unemployment, and a disruption in the services provided by our vendors. Continued disruptions to our clients\u2019 businesses could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, and losses on our loans, negatively impact regional economic conditions, result in declines in local loan demand, liquidity of loan guarantors, the value of loan collateral (particularly in real estate), loan originations, and deposit availability and negatively impact the implementation of our growth strategy. Although the U.S. government introduced a number of programs designed to soften the impact of COVID-19 on small businesses, our borrowers may still not be able to satisfy their financial obligations to us.\nIn addition, COVID-19 has impacted and likely will continue to impact the financial ability of businesses and consumers to borrow money, which would negatively impact loan volumes. Certain of our borrowers are in, or have exposure to, the non-essential retail, restaurants, hotels, CRE-retail, and arts, entertainment and gaming industries and are located in areas that are, or were, quarantined or under stay-at-home orders. COVID-19 may also have an adverse effect on our commercial real estate portfolio, particularly with respect to real estate with exposure to these industries, and our consumer loan portfolios. As COVID-19 cases have begun to surge in recent months, any new or prolonged quarantine or stay-at-home orders would have a negative adverse impact on these borrowers and their revenue streams, which consequently impacts their ability to meet their financial obligations to us and could result in loan defaults.\nThe ultimate extent of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effect on our business will depend on many factors, primarily including the speed and extent of any recovery from the related economic recession. Among other things, this will depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in our markets, the development, distribution and supply of vaccines, therapies and other public health initiatives to control the spread of the disease, the nature and size of federal economic stimulus and other governmental efforts, and the possibility of additional state lockdown or stay-at-home orders in our markets in response to the recent surge in the number of COVID-19 cases.\nThe initial distribution of vaccines has been slow, and there may continue to be challenges with producing and distributing sufficient quantities of the vaccines. If the general public is unwilling or unable to access effective vaccines and therapies, this may also prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, new variants of COVID-19 may increase the spread or severity of COVID-19 and previously developed vaccines and therapies may not be as effective against new COVID-19 variants.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we may experience adverse financial consequences due to a number of other factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022a further and sustained decline in our stock price or the occurrence of what management would deem to be a triggering event that could, under certain circumstances, cause management to perform additional impairment testing on our goodwill and other intangible assets that could result in an additional impairment charge being recorded for that period, and adversely impact our results of operations and the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us. The Company incurred a $31.5 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2020;\n\u2022increased demand on our liquidity as we meet borrowers\u2019 needs, experience significant credit deterioration, and cover expenses related to our business continuity plan;\n\u2022the potential for reduced liquidity and its negative affect on our capital and leverage ratios;\n\u2022the negative effect on earnings resulting from the Bank modifying loans and agreeing to loan payment deferrals due to the COVID-19 crisis;\n\u2022the modification of our business practices, including with respect to branch operations, employee travel, employee work locations, participation in meetings, events and conferences, and related changes for our vendors and other business partners;\n\u2022increases in federal and state taxes as a result of the effects of the pandemic and stimulus programs on governmental budgets;\n\u2022an increase in FDIC premiums if the agency experiences additional resolution costs relating to bank failures;\n\u2022increased cyber and payment fraud risk due to increased online and remote activity; and\n\u2022other operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices because of the pandemic and governmental actions to contain it.\nOverall, we believe that the economic impact from COVID-19 could have a material and adverse impact on our business and result in significant losses in our loan portfolio, all of which would adversely and materially impact our earnings and capital. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nThe U.S. government and banking regulators, including the FRB, have taken a number of unprecedented actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the CARES Act, which established a $2.0 trillion economic stimulus package, including cash payments to individuals, supplemental unemployment insurance benefits and a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. In addition, on December 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, a $900.0 billion COVID-19 relief package that includes an additional $284.5 billion in PPP funding, and Congress is in the process of negotiating additional stimulus bills and other actions in response to COVID-19. In addition to implementing the programs contemplated by these acts, the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a steady stream of guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and have taken a number of unprecedented steps to help banks navigate the pandemic and mitigate its impact. These include, without limitation:\n\u2022requiring banks to focus on business continuity and pandemic planning;\n\u2022adding pandemic scenarios to stress testing;\n\u2022encouraging bank use of capital conservation buffers and reserves in lending programs;\n\u2022permitting certain regulatory reporting extensions;\n\u2022reducing margin requirements on swaps;\n\u2022permitting certain otherwise prohibited investments in investment funds;\n\u2022issuing guidance to encourage banks to work with customers affected by the pandemic and encourage loan workouts; and\n\u2022providing credit under the CRA for certain pandemic-related loans, investments and public service.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets, and the FRB has taken a number of actions in response.\nIn March 2020, the FRB dramatically reduced the target federal funds rate and announced a $700 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the FRB reduced the interest that it pays on excess reserves. We expect that these reductions in interest rates, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect our net interest income, our net interest margin and our profitability. The FRB also launched the Main Street Lending Program, which offers deferred interest on four-year loans to small and mid-sized businesses. The Main Street Lending Program terminated on January 8, 2021. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business activities as a result of new government and regulatory laws, policies, programs and guidelines, as well as market reactions to such activities, remains uncertain but may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted banking and other financial activities in the areas in which we operate and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues for us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the ability of our employees and clients to engage in banking and other financial transactions in the geographic areas in which we operate and could create widespread business continuity issues for us. We also could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to the effects and restrictions of an outbreak or escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic in our market areas, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, there is no assurance that such plans and safeguards will be effective. Further, we rely upon our third-party vendors to conduct business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. If any of these vendors are unable to continue to provide us with these services, it could negatively impact our ability to serve our clients.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability.\nShifts in short-term interest rates may reduce our net interest income, which is the principal component of our earnings. The impact on earnings can be adverse when the slope of the yield curve flattens, that is, when short-term interest rates increase more than long-term interest rates or when long-term interest rates decrease more than short-term interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities and other assets. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Rising interest rates will likely result in a decline in fair value of our fixed-rate debt securities. Unrealized losses due to changes in interest rates on available for sale securities are recognized in other comprehensive income and reduce total shareholders\u2019 equity and do not negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios. However, tangible common equity and the associated ratios used by many investors would be reduced. Realized losses from debt securities sales reduce our regulatory capital ratios.\nIn March 2020, the FRB reduced the target federal funds rate to a range of 0.0 - 0.25%. We expect that this reduction in interest rates, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect our net interest income, our net interest margin and our profitability.\nWe measure interest rate risk under various rate scenarios and using specific criteria and assumptions. A summary of this process, along with the results of our net interest income simulations, is included at Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under \u201cInterest Rate Risk.\u201d Although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable and effectively managed, significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nWe are subject to risk concerning the discontinuance of LIBOR.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. We have exposure to LIBOR in various aspects through our financial contracts. Instruments that may be impacted include loans, securities, deposits, subordinated debentures and derivatives, among other financial contracts indexed to LIBOR and that mature after December 31, 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR.\nGiven the extensive use of LIBOR across financial markets, the transition to an alternative rate presents various risks that could adversely impact the value of and return on the Company\u2019s existing instruments and contracts. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with, and the value of our floating-rate obligations, loans, securities, deposits, subordinated debentures, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators with respect to our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language, or lack of fallback language, in LIBOR-based instruments; and\n\u2022require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, such as SOFR.\nThe manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the fair value of our securities portfolio was approximately $1.7 billion. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could result in the recognition of a loss through earnings. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWeather-related events and other natural disasters, as well as man-made disasters, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on financial results and condition.\nA significant portion of our operations are located in areas that are susceptible to floods, droughts, tornadoes and other severe weather events. Severe weather events, such as the derecho experienced in 2020, could cause disruptions to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition. While we maintain insurance covering many of these weather-related events, including coverage for lost profits and extra expense, there is no insurance against the disruption that a severe weather event could produce to the markets that we serve and the resulting adverse impact on our borrowers to timely repay their loans and the value of any collateral held by us. The severity and impact of weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change.\nCredit and Lending Risks\nWe must manage our credit risk effectively.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions. In addition, we primarily serve the banking and financial services needs of small to mid-sized businesses. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, may experience volatility in operating results, and may have elevated business continuity risk due to the limited size of the management group, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. We attempt to minimize our credit risk through prudent loan application approval procedures, careful monitoring of the concentration of our loans within specific industries and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by our credit review department. We periodically examine our credit process and implement changes to improve our procedures and standards. However, we cannot assure you that such approval and monitoring procedures will reduce these credit risks. If the overall economic climate in the United States, generally, or our market areas, specifically, declines, or even if it does not, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require increases in the provision for loan losses, which would cause our net income and return on equity to decrease.\nOur loan portfolio has a significant concentration of commercial real estate loans, which involve risks specific to real estate value.\nCommercial real estate lending comprises a significant portion of our lending business. Specifically, commercial real estate loans were approximately 49.8% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020. The market value of real estate securing our commercial real estate loans can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. Although a significant portion of such loans is secured by real estate as a secondary form of repayment, adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, the repayment of the commercial real estate loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties.\nIf problems develop in the commercial real estate sector, particularly within one or more of our markets, the value of collateral securing our commercial real estate loans could decline, which could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and/or capital. In light of the continued general uncertainty that exists in the economy and credit markets nationally, we may experience deterioration in the performance of our commercial real estate loan customers.\nCommercial, industrial and agricultural loans make up a significant portion of our loan portfolio.\nCommercial, industrial and agricultural loans (including credit cards and commercially related overdrafts) were approximately 33.6% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020. Our commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral is accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation value of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any exists. As a result, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing these loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. In addition, if the U.S. economy declines, this could harm the businesses of our commercial and industrial customers and reduce the value of the collateral securing these loans.\nPayments on agricultural loans are dependent on the successful operation or management of the farm property. The success of the farm may be affected by many factors outside the control of the borrower, including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields, such as hail, drought and floods (although borrowers may attempt to mitigate this risk by purchasing crop insurance), loss of livestock due to disease or other factors, declines in market prices for agricultural\nproducts both domestically and internationally, and the impact of government regulations, including changes in price supports, subsidies, tariffs, trade agreements, and environmental regulations. In addition, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm. If the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The primary crops in our market areas are corn and soybeans. Accordingly, adverse circumstances affecting these crops could have an adverse effect on our agricultural portfolio. Likewise, agricultural operating loans involve a greater degree of risk than lending on residential properties, particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as farm equipment or assets such as livestock or crops. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation.\nOur allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe establish our allowance for credit losses at a level considered appropriate by management to absorb current expected credit losses based on an analysis of the portfolio, market environment and other factors we deem relevant. The allowance for credit losses represents our estimate of current expected losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant information available to us. The allowance contains an allocation for loans specifically evaluated, as well as loans collectively evaluated. Additions to the allowance for credit losses, are estimated through the current expected credit loss model, which reflects current and forecasted conditions. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Although management has established an allowance for credit losses it believes is adequate to absorb current expected credit losses, the allowance may not be adequate. We could sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the amount of our allowance for credit losses. Higher loan losses could arise for a variety of reasons, including changes in economic, operating and other conditions within our markets, as well as changes in the financial condition, cash flows, and operations of our borrowers. At December 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total gross loans was 1.59% and as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was approximately 130.01%. An increase in the allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income and, most likely, capital, and may have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and could result in further losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our nonperforming loans, which includes nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, totaled $42.7 million, or 1.23% of our loan portfolio. Our nonperforming assets, which include nonperforming loans plus foreclosed assets, net, totaled $45.0 million, or 1.29% of loans.\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or foreclosed assets, thereby adversely affecting our net income and returns on assets and equity, increasing our loan administration costs and adversely affecting our efficiency ratio. When we take collateral in foreclosure and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its fair market value, which may result in a loss. These nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets also increase our risk profile and the capital our regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management and can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. If we experience increases in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, our net interest income may be negatively impacted and our loan administration costs could increase, each of which could have an adverse effect on our net income and related ratios, such as return on assets and equity.\nWe may encounter issues with environmental law compliance if we take possession, through foreclosure or otherwise, of the real property that secures a loan.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property's value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCapital & Liquidity Risks\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds consists of customer deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, provide a better risk/return trade-off. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we could lose a relatively\nlow cost source of funds, which would require us to seek other, potentially higher cost funding alternatives. Other primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations, investment securities maturities and sales, and funds from sales of our stock. Additional liquidity is provided by brokered deposits, bank lines of credit, repurchase agreements and the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, pay our expenses, pay dividends to our shareholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may desire or be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We intend to grow our business organically and to explore opportunities to grow our business by taking advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities, and such growth plans may require us to raise additional capital to ensure that we have adequate levels of capital to support such growth on top of our current operations. In order to accommodate future capital needs, we maintain a universal shelf registration statement, which allows for future sale up to $100 million of securities. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed or desired, on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or desired, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth or acquisitions could be materially impaired.\nDowngrades in the credit rating of one or more insurers that provide credit enhancement for our state and municipal securities portfolio may have an adverse impact on the market for, and valuation of, these types of securities.\nWe invest in tax-exempt and taxable state and local municipal securities, some of which are insured by monoline insurers. As of December 31, 2020, we had $628.3 million of municipal securities (recorded values), which represented 37.9% of our total securities portfolio. Following the onset of the financial crisis, several of these insurers came under scrutiny by rating agencies. Even though management generally purchases municipal securities on the overall credit strength of the issuer, the reduction in the credit rating of an insurer may negatively impact the market for and valuation of our investment securities. Such a downgrade could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to certain limitations and restrictions, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue paying the same level of dividends in the future that we have paid in the past or that we will be able to pay future dividends at all.\nThe ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to the Bank, including the requirement under the Iowa Banking Act that the Bank may not pay dividends in excess of its undivided profits. If these regulatory requirements are not met, the Bank will not be able to pay dividends to us, and we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nIn addition, as a bank holding company, our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. The Federal Reserve guidelines generally require us to review the effects of the cash payment of dividends on common stock and other Tier 1 capital instruments (e.g. perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred debt) in light of our earnings, capital adequacy and financial condition. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve indicates that the board of directors of a bank holding company (including a financial holding company) should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the company\u2019s dividends if:\n\u2022the company\u2019s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;\n\u2022the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company\u2019s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or\n\u2022the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nAlso, banking institutions that do not maintain a capital conservation buffer, comprised of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum capital requirements will face constraints on the payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall, unless prior regulatory approval is obtained. Accordingly, if the Bank fails to maintain the applicable minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, distributions to the Company may be prohibited or limited, and if the Company fails to maintain the applicable minimum\ncapital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, distributions to or stock repurchases from the Company\u2019s shareholders may be prohibited or limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $41.8 million of junior subordinated debentures held by three statutory business trusts that we control. Interest payments on the debentures, which totaled $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, must be paid before we pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. We have the right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters. However, if we elect to defer interest payments, all deferred interest must be paid before we may pay dividends on our capital stock.\nWe have counterparty risk, and therefore, we may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be negatively affected by the actions and the soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are generally interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, credit or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and regularly engage in transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions may expose us to credit or other risks if another financial institution experiences adverse circumstances. In certain circumstances, the collateral that we hold may be insufficient to fully cover the risk that a counterparty defaults on its obligations, which may cause us to experience losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetitive and Strategic Risks\nWe face intense competition in all phases of our business from banks, other financial institutions, and non-banks.\nThe banking and financial services businesses in our markets are highly competitive. Our competitors include large regional banks, local community banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market mutual funds, small local credit unions as well as large aggressive and expansion-minded credit unions, fintech companies, and other non-bank financial services providers. Many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as we are. Many of our unregulated competitors compete across geographic boundaries and are able to provide customers with a competitive alternative to traditional banking services, including financial transaction processing, lending platforms, and maintenance of funds.\nIncreased competition in our markets may result in a decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits, reduced spreads between loan rates and deposit rates, increased pressure on underwriting standards, or loan terms that are more favorable to the borrower. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our results, our financial condition, and our ability to grow and remain profitable. In addition, the diminishing role of banks as financial intermediaries has resulted and could continue to result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology.\nThe financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to enabling us to better serve our customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and the potential for cost reduction. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability, both internally and through our core processor, to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow our market share. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we cannot provide you with assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers.\nWe may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed and potential acquisitions, including execution risks, failure to realize anticipated transaction benefits, and failure to overcome integration risks, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nWe plan to continue to grow our businesses organically but remain open to considering potential bank or other acquisition opportunities that make financial and strategic sense. In the event that we do pursue acquisitions, we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated transaction benefits. Acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022We may incur time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in our attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business.\n\u2022We are exposed to potential asset and credit quality risks and unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks or businesses we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our earnings, capital and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022The acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers and employees of the acquired business and our business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of acquisitions within the expected time frame, or ever, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful.\n\u2022To finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds or pursue other forms of financing, such as issuing convertible preferred stock, which may have high dividend rates or may be highly dilutive to holders of our common stock, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or issuing capital stock, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders.\n\u2022We may be unsuccessful in realizing other anticipated benefits from acquisitions. For example, we may not be successful in realizing anticipated cost savings.\nIn addition to the foregoing, we may face additional risks in acquisitions to the extent we acquire new lines of business, new products, or enter new geographic areas, in which we have little or no current experience, especially if we lose key employees of the acquired operations. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. Our inability to overcome risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully implement our acquisition growth strategy and grow our business and profitability.\nAccounting and Tax Risks\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe processes that we use to estimate expected credit losses and to measure the fair value of assets carried on the balance sheet at fair value, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models are complex and reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have processes and procedures in place governing internal valuation models and their testing and calibration, such assumptions are complex as we must make judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions could have resulted in significant changes in valuation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax law and may not realize tax benefits which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws at national or state levels could have an effect on the Company\u2019s short-term and long-term earnings. Changes in tax laws could affect the Company\u2019s earnings as well as its customers\u2019 financial positions, or both. Changes in tax laws could also require the revaluation of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax position, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, current portions of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets relate to tax-effected state net operating loss carry-forwards, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in the Company\u2019s ownership.\nOperational Risks\nAs a participating lender in the PPP, we are subject to additional risks of litigation from our clients or other parties regarding our processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some of or all PPP loan guarantees.\nThe CARES Act included a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals could apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. The Bank participated as a lender in the PPP. The PPP opened on April 3, 2020; however, because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there is some ambiguity in the laws, rules, and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes us to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. On April 24, 2020, an additional $310 billion in funding for PPP loans was authorized, with such funds available for PPP loans beginning on April 27, 2020. In addition, on December 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, a $900.0 billion COVID-19 relief package that includes an additional $284.5 billion in PPP funding.\nSince the opening of the PPP, several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP and claims related to agent fees. If any such litigation is filed against us and is not resolved in a manner favorable to us, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs, or reputational damage caused by the PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Also, it has been reported that many borrowers fraudulently obtained PPP loans through the program. We may be subject to regulatory and litigation risk if any of our PPP borrowers used fraudulent means to obtain a PPP loan.\nWe also have credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules, and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, or if the borrower fraudulently obtained a PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nWe face the risk of possible future goodwill impairment.\nThe Company completed an interim goodwill assessment as of September 30, 2020, and based upon our interim assessment, we concluded that an impairment of goodwill existed, and we incurred a $31.5 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2020. We will be required to perform additional goodwill impairment assessments on at least an annual basis, and perhaps more frequently, which could result in additional goodwill impairment charges. It is possible that the effects of COVID-19 could cause the occurrence of what management would deem to be subsequent triggering events that could, under certain circumstances, cause the Company to perform a goodwill or intangible asset impairment test and result in an additional impairment charge being recorded in that period. Any future goodwill impairment charge on the current goodwill balance, or future goodwill arising out of acquisitions that we are required to take, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing our net income or increasing our net losses.\nOur ability to attract and retain management and key personnel may affect future growth and earnings.\nMuch of our success and growth has been influenced by our ability to attract and retain management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in our market areas. Our ability to attract and retain executive officers, management teams, branch managers and loan officers will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategy. The Dodd-Frank Act also directs the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives. These rules, when adopted, may make it more difficult to attract and retain the people we need to operate our businesses and limit our ability to promote our objectives through our compensation and incentive programs. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, ransomware, malware or other cyber-attacks.\nThere continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which could increase their risks of identity theft and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.\nInformation pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks and systems maintained by us and certain third party partners, such as our online banking, mobile banking or accounting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain the confidence of our clients. Breaches of information security also may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or the confidential information of our clients, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication,\nadvances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. Our third party partners\u2019 inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in a number of negative events, including losses to us or our clients, loss of business or clients, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to our business, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems of third parties, and any systems failures, interruptions or data breaches involving these systems could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, third party servicers, accounting systems, mobile and online banking platforms and financial intermediaries. We outsource to third parties many of our major systems, such as data processing and mobile and online banking. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions. A system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process loans or gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, result in potential noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, failures of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties, could disrupt our operations or adversely affect our reputation.\nIt may be difficult for us to replace some of our third party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason, and even if we are able to replace them, it may be at higher cost or result in the loss of customers. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of information and the monitoring of a large number of transactions on a minute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service could have significant consequences. We also interact with and rely on retailers, for whom we process transactions, as well as financial counterparties and regulators. Each of these third parties may be targets of the same types of fraudulent activity, computer break-ins and other cybersecurity breaches described above, and the cybersecurity measures that they maintain to mitigate the risk of such activity may be different than our own and may be inadequate.\nAs a result of financial entities and technology systems becoming more interdependent and complex, a cyber incident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including ourselves. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, and if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, compensation risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as\nthere may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nOur internal controls may be ineffective.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. In deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers' representations that their financial statements conform to GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. We also may rely on customer representations and certifications, or other audit or accountants' reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of our clients. Our financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be negatively affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and the laws and regulations to which we are subject, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory agencies. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred, which may adversely affect our business operations. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we provide, as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. In addition, political developments, including possible changes in law introduced by the new presidential administration or the appointment of new personnel in regulatory agencies, add uncertainty to the implementation, scope and timing of regulatory reforms. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to stringent capital and liquidity requirements.\nAs a result of the implementation of the Basel III Rules, we were required to meet new and increased capital requirements beginning on January 1, 2015. In addition, beginning in 2016, banking institutions that do not maintain a capital conservation buffer, comprised of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum capital requirements face constraints on the payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall, unless prior regulatory approval is obtained. Accordingly, if the Bank or the Company fails to maintain the applicable minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, distributions by the Bank to the Company, or dividends or stock repurchases by the Company, may be prohibited or limited.\nFuture increases in minimum capital requirements could adversely affect our net income. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with the minimum capital requirements, our failure could result in our regulators taking formal or informal actions against us which could restrict our future growth or operations.\nFederal and state regulators periodically examine our business, and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Iowa Division periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place our bank into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA requires the Bank, consistent with safe and sound operations, to ascertain and meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income areas. The Bank\u2019s failure to comply with the CRA could, among other things, result in the denial or delay of certain corporate applications filed by us or the Bank, including applications for branch openings or relocations and applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or holding company. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, federal banking agencies, and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A challenge to an institution\u2019s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions against us.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act require financial institutions to design and implement programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Federal and state bank regulators also have focused on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. In recent years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCommon Stock Risks\nThere is a limited trading market for our common shares, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nAlthough our common shares are listed for quotation on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the trading in our common shares has substantially less liquidity than many other companies listed on Nasdaq. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. We cannot assure you that the volume of trading in our common shares will increase in the future.\nCertain shareholders own a significant interest in the Company and may exercise their control in a manner detrimental to your interests.\nCertain MidWestOne shareholders who are descendants of our founder collectively control approximately 17.6% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, certain MidWestOne shareholders that previously owned ATBancorp collectively control approximately 22.1% of our outstanding common stock. These shareholders may have the opportunity to exert influence on the outcome of matters required to be submitted to shareholders for approval. In addition, the significant level of ownership by these shareholders may contribute to the rather limited liquidity of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are subject to changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines.\nOur financial performance is impacted by accounting principles, policies and guidelines. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nThe FASB and the SEC periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. The implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reputation could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, or the risk to our business, financial condition or results of operations from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, or ethical behavior of our employees, and from actions taken by regulators, ratings agencies and others as a result of that conduct. Damage to our reputation could impact our ability to attract new or maintain existing loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships.\nThe stock market can be volatile, and fluctuations in our operating results and other factors could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, government shutdowns, trade wars, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, our operating results may fluctuate and vary from period to period due to the risk factors set forth herein. As a result, period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to our quarterly or annual results, annual projections and the impact of these risk factors on our operating results or financial position.", "PERMNO": 92593, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MOFG"}
