{"cik": "1365101", "company": "Primo Water Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur operating losses in the future.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur operating losses in the future. As of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $263.3 million. Our losses from continuing operations were $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. While we achieved profitability for the first time during the third quarter of 2014, we may not be profitable in future quarters. Our losses may continue as we incur additional costs and expenses related to branding and marketing, expansion of operations, strategic acquisitions, product development, development of relationships with strategic business partners, regulatory compliance and litigation. If our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our financial performance will be adversely affected. If our sales do not grow to offset any increased expenses, we may not experience profitability in the future. If we do not achieve sustained profitability, we may be unable to continue operations.\nWe depend on a small number of large retailers for most of our consumer sales. Our arrangements with these retailers for our bottled water exchange services and sales of our water dispensers are nonexclusive and may be terminated at will.\nCertain retailers make up a significant percentage of our retail sales volume, such that if one or more of these retailers were to materially reduce or terminate its business with us, our sales would suffer. For 2014, Walmart and Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement represented approximately 40% and 22% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. While we sell a small percentage of our dispensers directly to consumers through our online store and other direct sales channels, the vast majority of our sales are made through our retail partners.\nWe have arrangements with certain retailers for our products and services, but we cannot provide any assurance of any future sales. None of our significant retail accounts are contractually bound to offer our Exchange service or water dispensers. As a result, retailers can discontinue our Exchange services or products at any time and offer a competitor\u2019s services or products, or none at all. Additionally, the contractual commitments of retail customers of our Refill services are not long-term in nature. Continued positive relations with a retailer depend upon various factors, including price, customer service, consumer demand and competition. Certain of our retailers have multiple vendor policies and may seek to offer a competitor\u2019s products or services at new or existing locations. If any significant retailer materially reduces, terminates or is unwilling to expand its relationship with us, or requires price reductions or other adverse modifications in our selling terms, our sales would suffer.\nAdditionally, most major retailers continually evaluate and often modify their in-store retail strategies, including product placement, store set-up and design, promotions and demographic targets. Our business could suffer significant setbacks in net sales and operating income if one or more of our major retail customers modified its current retail strategy resulting in a termination or reduction of its business relationship with us, a reduction in store penetration or an unfavorable product placement within such retailer\u2019s stores, any or all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience difficulties in realizing the anticipated benefits associated with our strategic alliance agreement with DS Services of America, Inc. (\u201cDS Services\u201d).\nWe may not be able to realize all of the anticipated benefits and synergies associated with our strategic alliance agreement (the \u201cDS Services Agreement\u201d) DS Services. The ability to realize the anticipated benefits of this arrangement (including incremental revenue, reduced distribution costs and improved gross margins) will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to successfully transition DS Services customers over to Primo as well as manage the DS Services distribution network to adequately service the legacy Primo customers. If any of our retailer customers are not satisfied with the performance of services provided by DS Services, we could lose the business of that retailer customer which would negatively impact our business. Finally, we expect to incur costs in connection with assuming account management, billing and collections responsibility for DS Services\u2019 current three and five gallon retail exchange customers and, if we do not realize the anticipated benefits of the business arrangement with DS Services, including the anticipated revenues related to the addition of existing retail customers of DS Services\u2019 three and five gallon retail bottled water exchange business as new customers of our water bottle exchange business, these costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe success of our business depends on retailer and consumer acceptance of our products and services.\nWe are a consumer products and services company operating in the highly-competitive bottled water market and rely on continued consumer demand or preference for our products and services. To generate sales and profits, we must sell products that appeal to retailers and to consumers. Our future success depends on consumer acceptance, particularly at the household level, of our products and services. There is no guarantee that there will be significant market acceptance of our Exchange and Refill services or that we will be successful in selling our water dispensers on a scale necessary to achieve sustained profitability.\nAs a result of our \u201crazor-razorblade\u201d business strategy, we are reliant on consumer adoption of our \u201crazors\u201d (water dispensers) to drive sales of the \u201crazorblades\u201d (Exchange and Refill services). If we are unable to generate consumer adoption of our water dispensers, we will face significant difficulties growing sales of our Exchange and Refill services, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe markets for our products and services are evolving rapidly and we may not be able to accurately assess the size of the markets or trends that may emerge and affect our businesses. Consumer preference can change due to a variety of factors, including social trends, negative publicity and economic changes. If we are unable to convince current and potential retail customers and individual consumers of the advantages of our products and services, our ability to sell our products and services will be limited. Consumer acceptance also will affect, and be affected by, our existing retail partners\u2019 and potential new retail partners\u2019 decisions to sell our products and services and their perception of the likelihood of consumers purchasing our products and services. Even if retail customers purchase our products or services, there is no guarantee that they will be successful in selling our products or services to consumers on a scale necessary for us to achieve sustained profitability and growth. Any significant changes in consumer preferences for purified bottled water could result in reduced demand for our products and services and erosion of our competitive and financial position.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, face competition from companies with far greater resources than we have and could encounter significant competition from these companies in our niche markets of water bottle exchange services and related products and refill services.\nWe primarily participate in the highly competitive bottled water segment of the non-alcoholic beverage industry. The industry is dominated by large and well-known international companies, and numerous smaller firms are also seeking to establish market niches. In our business model, we not only offer three- and five-gallon bottled water but also provide consumers the ability to exchange their used containers as part of our Exchange service. Competitive factors with respect to our business include pricing, taste, advertising, sales promotion programs, product innovation, increased efficiency in production and distribution techniques, the introduction of new packaging and brand and trademark development and protection.\nOur primary competitors in our bottled water business include Nestl\u00e9, The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo and Dr Pepper Snapple Group. While none of these companies currently offers a nationwide water bottle exchange service at retail, Nestl\u00e9 offers this service on a regional basis. Many of these competitors are leading consumer products companies, have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, have established a strong brand presence with consumers and have established relationships with retailers, manufacturers, bottlers and distributors necessary to start an exchange business at retail locations nationwide should they decide to do so. Our Refill services business faces direct competition in its industry and for its retail customers from Glacier Water Services, Inc., which has a strong brand presence and greater financial and other resources than we have. Competitors with greater financial resources may put pressure on the prices at which we offer our products and services which would have a negative impact on our margins. In addition to competition between companies within the bottled water industry, the industry itself faces significant competition from other non-alcoholic beverages, including carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks and waters, juices, sport and energy drinks, coffees, teas and spring and tap water.\nOur bottled water business also faces competition from other methods of purified water consumption such as countertop filtration systems, faucet mounted filtration systems, in-line whole-house filtration systems, water filtration dispensing products such as pitchers and jugs, standard and advanced feature water coolers and refrigerator dispensed filtered and unfiltered water.\nWe also compete directly and indirectly in the water dispenser marketplace. There are many large consumer products companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, a larger brand presence with consumers and established relationships with retailers that could decide to enter the marketplace. Should any of these consumer products companies so decide to enter the water dispenser marketplace, sales of our water dispensers could be materially and adversely impacted, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our sales of bottled water.\nIn our bottled water exchange business, we depend on independent bottlers, distributors and suppliers for our business to operate.\nWhile the actual number of independent bottlers, distributers and suppliers we use to provide our Exchange service has decreased in connection with our strategic alliance with DS Services, we continue to be substantially dependent on independent bottlers, distributors and suppliers to bottle and deliver our bottled water products and provide our Exchange service to our retail customers. We do not have our own manufacturing facilities to produce bottled water products. We are and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, entirely dependent on third parties to supply the bottle pre-forms, bottles, water and other materials necessary to operate our bottled water business. We rely on third-party supply companies to manufacture our three- and five-gallon water bottles and deliver them to our bottlers. In turn, we rely on bottlers to properly purify the water, include our mineral enhancements and bottle the finished product without contamination and pursuant to our quality standards and preparation procedures. Finally, we rely upon our distributors to deliver bottled water to our retail partners in a timely manner, accurately enter information regarding the delivery of the bottles into our management information system, manage our recycling center displays and return used bottles to the bottlers to be sanitized or crushed and recycled.\nWe can make no assurance that we will be able to maintain these third-party relationships until the transition of their responsibilities to DS Services is complete. As independent companies, these bottlers, distributors and suppliers make their own business decisions. Suppliers may choose not to do business with us for a variety of reasons, including competition, brand identity, product standards and concerns regarding our economic viability. They may have the right to determine whether, and to what extent, they produce and distribute our products, our competitors\u2019 products and their own products. Some of the business for these bottlers, distributors and suppliers comes from producing or selling our competitors\u2019 products. These bottlers, distributors and suppliers may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands. In addition, their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer. In addition, we will face risks associated with any bottler\u2019s or distributor\u2019s or DS Services\u2019 failure to adhere to quality control and service guidelines we establish or failure to ensure an adequate and timely supply of product and services at retail locations. As we have transitioned the majority of the bottling and distribution responsibilities in our Exchange services to DS Services, we have become substantially dependent on DS Services\u2019 ability to provide bottling and distribution services to our retail partners. Should our strategic arrangement with DS Services not be successful or should the strategic alliance agreement not be extended beyond its seven year term, we may be unable to re-establish our relationships with our current independent bottlers, distributors and suppliers or establish additional relationships as necessary to support growth and profitability of our business on economically viable terms. Any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If we are unable to obtain and maintain a source of supply for bottles, water and other materials, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nIn our bottled water exchange business, if our distributors do not perform to our retailers\u2019 expectations, if we encounter difficulties in managing our distributor operations or if we or our distributors are not able to manage growth effectively, our retail relationships may be adversely impacted and business may suffer.\nWe rely on our independent distributors to deliver our three- and five-gallon bottled water and provide our Exchange service to retailers. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to manage our retail relationships through the performance of our distributor partners, including DS Services. We exercise only limited influence over the resources our distributor partners devote to delivery and exchange of our three- and five-gallon water bottles. Our retailers impose demanding service requirements on us and we could suffer a loss of consumer or retailer goodwill if our distributors do not adhere to our quality control and service guidelines or fail to ensure an adequate and timely supply of bottled water at retail locations. The poor performance of services provided to a major retailer could jeopardize our entire relationship with that retailer and cause our bottled water sales and Exchange service to suffer. In addition, the number of retail locations offering our Exchange service and our corresponding sales have grown significantly over the past several years. Accordingly, our distributors, including DS Services, must be able to adequately service an increasing number of retail accounts. If our growth is not managed effectively, our bottled water sales and Exchange service may suffer.\nIf the providers of our Refill services do not perform to retailer expectations, our retail relationships may be adversely impacted and business may suffer.\nWith respect to our Refill services, at December 31, 2014 we relied, in part, on independent service providers to install, maintain and repair the reverse osmosis water systems at our retail customers\u2019 locations. These independent service providers are also responsible for providing retail customer training with respect to the reverse osmosis water systems, submitting water for testing and conducting monthly meter readings to determine water usage for billing purposes. Accordingly, the success of our Refill services depends on our ability to manage our retail relationships through the performance of these service providers. The significant majority of these service providers are independent dealers and we exercise only limited influence over the resources they devote to their responsibilities with respect to our retail customers. Our success with respect to our Refill services depends on our ability to establish and maintain relationships with these independent service providers and on the service providers\u2019 ability to operate viable businesses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to maintain such relationships. Retail customers of our Refill services impose demanding service requirements and we could suffer a loss of retailer or consumer goodwill if these service providers do not perform to the retail customers\u2019 expectations. The poor performance of a single service provider to a major retailer could jeopardize our entire relationship with that retailer potentially preventing future installations at additional retail locations and causing sales to suffer.\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders.\nAt December 31, 2014, our cash totaled $0.5 million and we had $11.0 million in additional availability under our revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) with The Prudential Insurance Company of America and PICA Hartford Life Insurance Comfort Trust. We anticipate that our current cash, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our current capital needs for general corporate purposes. However, we may need or desire additional capital to finance our operations or to execute on our current or future business strategies, including to:\n\u00b7 expand the number of retail store locations in which our products and services are offered;\n\u00b7 enhance our operating infrastructure;\n\u00b7 acquire new businesses, products or technologies; or\n\u00b7 otherwise respond to competitive pressures.\nIf we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, when we desire them, our ability to invest in our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our services, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited and we could be forced to reduce, delay or cancel capital expenditures, sell assets, or scale down our operations, all of which could harm our ability to generate revenues and reduce the value of our stock.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered. In addition, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.\nWe are highly dependent upon the services of our senior management because of their experience, industry relationships and knowledge of the business. We are particularly dependent on the services of Billy D. Prim, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We do not have a formal succession plan in place for Mr. Prim.\nThe loss of one or more of our key employees could seriously harm our business and we may not be able to attract and retain individuals with the same or similar level of experience or expertise. We face competition for qualified employees from numerous sources and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. Our ability to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of factors, such as our results of operations, prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. Failure to recruit and retain such personnel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While our employment agreements with members of our senior management include customary confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, there can be no assurance that such provisions will be enforceable or adequately protect us.\nWe have Canadian operations and are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and political uncertainties.\nWe have Canadian operations, and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Risks inherent to operating internationally include: changes in a country\u2019s economic or political conditions, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements.\nTo the extent the United States dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar, our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced when translated into United States dollars.\nIn our water dispenser business, because all of our dispensers are manufactured in China, a significant disruption in the operations of these manufacturers or political unrest in China could materially adversely affect us.\nWe have only three manufacturers of water dispensers. Any disruption in production or inability of our manufacturers to produce quantities of water dispensers adequate to meet our needs could significantly impair our ability to operate our water dispenser business on a day-to-day basis. Our manufacturers are located in China, which exposes us to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the Chinese government, political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China, changes in currency exchange rates or developments in the U.S. that are adverse to trade, including enactment of protectionist legislation. In addition, our dispensers are shipped directly from the manufacturer to our retail partners. Although we routinely inspect and monitor our manufacturing partners\u2019 activities and products, we rely heavily upon their quality controls when producing and delivering the dispensers to our retail partners. Any of these matters could materially adversely affect our water dispenser business and, as a result, our profitability.\nIf the water we sell became contaminated, our business could be seriously harmed.\nWe have adopted various quality, environmental, health and safety standards. However, our products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated. A failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers, distributors or suppliers. Such a failure or contamination could result in expensive production interruptions, recalls and liability claims. A widespread product recall could result in losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. Moreover, negative publicity could be generated even from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls. Any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nIf any component of the water dispensers we sell is misused, the appliance may fail and cause personal injury or property damage. We may be subject to product liability claims as a result of any such failure, which will likely increase our costs and adversely affect our business and reputation.\nAlthough we include explicit instructions for the operation of our water dispensers we sell and safety warnings are included on all of the products we sell, consumers may misuse these products, including by tampering with the hot water safety lock devices, which could expose consumers to hot liquids. The misuse of any of the components of our water dispensers we sell may cause personal injury and damage to property.\nOur product liability insurance for personal injury and damage to property may not be sufficient or available to cover any successful product liability claim, or similar claims, against us, which could materially adversely impact our financial condition. Whether or not a claim against us would be successful, defense of the claim may be costly and the existence of any claim may adversely impact our reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nInterruption or disruption of our supply chain, distribution channels, bottling and distribution network or third-party services providers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability and that of our business partners, including suppliers, bottlers, distributors, retailers and service providers, to manufacture, sell and deliver products and services is critical to our success. Interruption or disruption of our supply chain, distribution channels or service network due to unforeseen events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues, natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires, hurricanes or other adverse weather and climate conditions, strikes and other labor disputes, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could impair our ability to manufacture, sell or deliver our products and services.\nThe consolidation of retail customers may adversely impact our operating margins and profitability.\nOur customers, such as mass merchants, supermarkets, warehouse clubs, food distributors and drug and pharmacy stores, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation may continue. These consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power. As a result, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, which have significant bargaining power. If we fail to respond to these trends in our industry, our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase trade promotions and consumer marketing for our products and services, both of which would adversely affect our margins and our financial results. These retailers may use floor or shelf space currently used for our products and services for their own private label products and services. In addition, retailers are increasingly carrying fewer brands in any one category and our results of operations will suffer if we are not selected by our significant customers to remain a vendor. In the event of consolidation involving our current retailers, we may lose key business if the surviving entities do not continue to purchase products or services from us.\nWe depend on key management information systems.\nWe depend on our management information systems (MIS) to process orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable, maintain distributor and customer information, maintain cost-efficient operations and assist distributors in delivering products and services on a timely basis. Any disruption in the operation of our MIS tools, the loss of employees knowledgeable about such systems, the termination of our relationships with third-party MIS partners or our failure to continue to effectively modify such systems as business expands could require us to expend significant additional resources or to invest additional capital to continue to manage our business effectively, and could even affect our compliance with public reporting requirements. Additionally, our MIS tools are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from, among other things, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, processing errors, computer viruses, hackers, other security issues or supplier defaults. Security, backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures. Any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors, processing inefficiencies, security breaches, inability to use the systems or process transactions, loss of customers or other business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe are subject to inventory loss and theft.\nWe are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. We have experienced inventory shrinkage in the past, and we cannot assure you that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively address the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is a necessary and unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft, our financial condition could be affected adversely.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of the impairment of intangibles.\nIn accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we must identify and value intangible assets that we acquire in business combinations, such as customer arrangements, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, that arise from contractual or other legal rights or that are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. The fair value of identified intangible assets is based upon an estimate of the future economic benefits expected to result from ownership, which represents the amount at which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.\nU.S. GAAP provides that intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment, and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives. U.S. GAAP also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non-amortized intangible assets for impairment. Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter.\nWe review our intangible assets with definite lives for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, as required by U.S. GAAP. An impairment of intangible assets with definite lives exists if the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected is less than the carrying value of the assets. If this measurement indicates a possible impairment, we compare the estimated fair value of the asset to the net book value to measure the impairment charge, if any.\nWe cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of intangible assets that totaled $9.5 million at December 31, 2014. Such events include strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, material negative changes in our relationships with material customers and other parties breaching their contractual obligations under non-compete agreements. Future impairments, if any, will be recognized as operating expenses.\nIf we are unable to build and maintain our brand image and corporate reputation, our business may suffer.\nOur success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products and services and effectively build the brand image for any new products. We cannot assure you, however, that any additional expenditures on advertising and marketing will have the desired impact on our products\u2019 brand image and on consumer preferences. Actual or perceived product quality issues or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause consumers to choose other products. Allegations of product defects or product contamination, even if untrue, may require us from time to time to recall a product from all of the markets in which the affected product was distributed. Product recalls would negatively affect our profitability and brand image. Also, adverse publicity surrounding water usage and any campaigns by activists attempting to connect our system to environmental issues, water shortages or workplace or human rights violations in certain developing countries in which we or our business partners operate, could negatively affect our overall reputation and our products\u2019 acceptance by consumers.\nAdverse weather conditions could negatively impact our business.\nUnseasonable or unusual weather may negatively impact demand for our products. The sales of our bottled water products, water dispensers and refill services are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cool or rainy weather may reduce temporarily the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods.\nWater scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact our long-term profitability.\nWater is a limited resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, population growth, increasing pollution, poor management and climate change. As demand for water continues to increase and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates, our business may incur increasing costs or face capacity constraints which could adversely affect our profitability or net sales in the long run.\nOur financial results and achievement of our growth strategy is dependent on our continued innovation and the successful development and launch of new products and product extensions.\nAchievement of our growth strategy is dependent, among other things, on our ability to extend the product offerings of our existing brands and introduce innovative new products. Although we devote significant focus to the development of new products, we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful. Our financial results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our ability to effectively gauge the direction of our key marketplaces and successfully identify, develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products in these changing marketplaces. In addition, our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe may pursue acquisitions and investments in new product lines, businesses or technologies that involve numerous risks, which could disrupt our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may in the future acquire or invest in new product lines, businesses or technologies to expand our current products and services. Acquisitions present a number of potential risks and challenges that could disrupt our business operations, increase our operating costs or capital expenditure requirements and reduce the value of the acquired product line, business or technology. For example, if we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition on favorable terms or at all. The process of negotiating acquisitions and integrating acquired products, services, technologies, personnel or businesses might result in significant transaction costs, operating difficulties or unexpected expenditures and might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. If we are successful in consummating an acquisition, we may not be able to integrate the acquired product line, business or technology into our existing business and products and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. Furthermore, potential acquisitions and investments may divert our management\u2019s attention, require considerable cash outlays and require substantial additional expenses that could harm our existing operations and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To complete future acquisitions, we may issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or incur amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, any of which could dilute the interests of our stockholders or adversely affect our profitability or cash flow.\nEconomic conditions and other economic factors could impact our business adversely in various respects.\nA slowdown in the U.S. economy or other economic factors affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, inflation, business conditions, fuel and energy costs, consumer debt levels, lack of available credit, interest rates, and tax rates, may affect our business adversely by reducing overall consumer spending or by shifting the purchasing habits of our target consumers, both of which could result in lower net sales, decreases in inventory turnover or a reduction in profitability due to lower margins. The current global economic uncertainty, the impact of recessions, and the potential for failures or realignments of financial institutions and the related impact on available credit may impact our suppliers, our distributors, our retail customers, and our operations in an adverse manner including, but not limited to, the inability of our retail customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, increased costs related to our distribution channels, the inability of our vendors to timely supply materials and an increased likelihood that our lender may be unable to honor its commitments under our senior revolving credit facility.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory and Legal Issues\nOur products and services are heavily regulated in the United States and Canada. If we are unable to continue to comply with applicable regulations and standards in any jurisdiction, we might not be able to sell our products in that jurisdiction or they could be recalled, and our business could be seriously harmed.\nThe production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States are subject to regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the \u201cFDCA\u201d), and by other regulatory authorities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Lanham Act and various environmental statutes. In Canada, these activities are subject to regulation by Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (the \u201cCFIA\u201d) under the Canadian Food and Drugs Act. We are also subject to various other federal, state, provincial and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, promotion, labeling and ingredients of such products. For example, measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require a deposit to be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in various jurisdictions. We anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels.\nThe FDA regulates bottled water as a food under the FDCA. Our bottled water must meet FDA and CFIA requirements of safety for human consumption, identity, quality and labeling. Further, any claims we make in marketing our products, such as claims related to the beneficial health effects of drinking water, are subject to FDA\u2019s and Canadian Competition Bureau\u2019s advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions. In addition, the FDA and HC have established current good manufacturing practices, regulations which govern the facilities, methods, practices and controls used for the processing, bottling and distribution of bottled drinking water. We are subject to additional or changing requirements under the recently enacted Federal Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, which requires among other things, that food facilities conduct contamination hazard analyses, implement risk-based preventive controls and develop track and trace capabilities. We and our third-party bottling and distribution partners are subject to these requirements. In addition, all public drinking water must meet Environmental Protection Agency standards established under the Safe Drinking Water Act for mineral and chemical concentration and drinking water quality and treatment. We also must comply with overlapping and, in some cases, inconsistent state regulations in a variety of areas. These state-level regulations, among other things, set standards for approved water sources and the information that must be provided and the basis on which any therapeutic claims for water may be made. In Canada, we are subject to similar regulations administered by Health Canada and the CFIA, as well as provincial authorities. We must expend resources to continuously monitor national, state and provincial legislative and regulatory activities in order to identify and ensure compliance with laws and regulations that apply to our bottled water business in each state and province in which we operate.\nAdditionally, the manufacture, sale and use of resins used to make water bottles are subject to regulation by the FDA and HC. These regulations relate to substances used in food packaging materials, not with specific finished food packaging products. Our beverage containers are deemed to be in compliance with FDA regulations if the components used in the containers: (i) are approved by the FDA and HC as indirect food additives for their intended uses and comply with the applicable FDA indirect food additive regulations; or (ii) are generally recognized as safe for their intended uses and are of suitable purity for those intended uses.\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission, FDA, Health Canada, CFIA or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall, repair or replacement of our products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations. The failure of our third party manufacturers or bottlers to produce merchandise that adheres to our quality control standards could damage our reputation and lead to customer litigation against us. If our manufacturers or distributors are unable or unwilling to recall products failing to meet our quality standards, we may be required to remove merchandise or recall those products at a substantial cost to us. We may be unable to recover costs related to product recalls.\nWe believe that our self-imposed standards meet or exceed those set by federal, state, provincial and local regulations. In addition, we voluntarily comply with the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s \u201cGreen Guides\u201d concerning the making of environmental claims in marketing materials. Nevertheless, our failure or the failure of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors or third-party service providers to comply with federal, state, provincial or local laws, rules or regulations could subject us to potential governmental enforcement action for violation of such regulations, which could result in warning letters, fines, product recalls or seizures, civil or criminal penalties and/or temporary or permanent injunctions, each of which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our failure, or even our perceived failure, to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could cause retailers and others to determine not to do business with us or reduce the amount of business they do with us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will comply with all applicable laws and regulations to which we and our products are subject. If we fail to comply, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities, including product liability claims, occupy a significant amount of our management\u2019s time and attention and damage our reputation.\nWe are from time to time party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. We evaluate these claims and proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. If our products are not properly manufactured or designed, personal injuries or property damage could result, which could subject us to claims for damages. The costs associated with defending product liability and other claims, and the payment of damages, could be substantial. Our reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful.\nWe are currently party to various legal and other proceedings. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings. These matters may involve substantial expense to us and occupy a significant amount of our management\u2019s time and attention, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations. In addition, there could be an increase in the scope of these matters and there could be additional lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations in the future. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any litigation.\nWe may establish reserves as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We base our assessments, estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates. Actual settlements, judgments or resolutions of these claims or proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance. A successful claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages and could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property, or our involvement in damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or result in the loss of use of products or services.\nWe have filed certain patent applications and trademark registration applications and intend to seek additional patents, to develop additional trademarks and seek federal registrations for such trademarks and to develop other intellectual property. We consider our Primo name and related trademarks and our other intellectual property to be valuable to our business, including the establishment of a national branded bottled water exchange program. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and other arrangements to protect our proprietary rights and could incur substantial expense to enforce our rights under such laws. A number of other companies, however, use trademarks similar or identical to the Primo\u00ae mark to identify their products, and we may not be able to stop these other companies from using such trademarks. The requirement to change any of our trademarks, service marks or trade names could entail significant expense and result in the loss of any goodwill associated with that trademark, service mark or trade name. While we have filed, and intend to file in the future, patent applications, where appropriate, and to pursue such applications with the patent authorities, we cannot be sure that patents will be issued on such applications or that any issued patents will not be successfully contested by third parties. Also, since issuance of a patent does not prevent other companies from using alternative, non-infringing technology or designs, we cannot be sure that any issued patents, or patents that may be issued to others and licensed to us, will provide significant or any commercial protection, especially as new competitors enter the market.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and other non-patented proprietary information relating to our product development, business processes and operating activities. We seek to protect this information through appropriate efforts to maintain its secrecy, including confidentiality agreements. We cannot be sure that these efforts will be successful or that confidentiality agreements will not be breached. We also cannot be sure that we would have adequate remedies for any breach of such agreements or other misappropriation of our trade secrets, or that our trade secrets and proprietary know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others. Our failure to successfully develop intellectual property, or to successfully obtain, maintain and enforce patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, could affect our ability to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and could cause our sales to suffer.\nWhere necessary, we may initiate litigation to enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. Any such litigation may require us to spend a substantial amount of time and money and could distract management from its day-to-day operations. Moreover, there is no assurance that we will be successful in any such litigation or that such litigation will not result in successful counterclaims or challenges to the validity of our intellectual property rights.\nOur business and our ability to provide products and services may be impaired by claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights characterize the consumer products industry. These traits can result in significant, protracted and materially expensive litigation. In addition, parties making infringement and other claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our products, services or utilize our business methods and could cause us to pay substantial damages. In the event of a successful claim of infringement, we may need to obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may not be available at a reasonable cost, or at all. It is possible that our intellectual property rights may not be valid or that we may infringe existing or future proprietary rights of others. Any successful infringement claims could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling products, providing services and utilizing business methods and require us to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, re-brand our Company, products or services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe three- and five-gallon polycarbonate plastic bottles that we use to bottle our water and sell in connection with our exchange business contain bisphenol A (\u201cBPA\u201d), a chemical that can possibly have adverse health effects on consumers, particularly young children. Any significant change in state, provincial or federal legislation, government regulation or perception by our customers of polycarbonate plastic in food and beverage products could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur three- and five-gallon polycarbonate plastic bottles contain BPA. The use of BPA in food packaging materials has been subject to safety assessments by several international, federal and state authorities. Pursuant to the March 30, 2012 FDA ruling, \u201cthe Food and Drug Administration\u2019s assessment is that the scientific evidence at this time does not suggest that the very low levels of human exposure to BPA through the diet are unsafe. The most appropriate course of action at this time is to continue scientific study and review of all new evidence regarding the safety of BPA.\u201d In the fall of 2014, FDA experts from across the agency, specializing in toxicology, analytical chemistry, endocrinology, epidemiology, and other fields, completed a four-year review of more than 300 scientific studies. The FDA review did not find any information in the evaluated studies to prompt a revision of FDA\u2019s safety assessment of BPA in food packaging at the time of the review.\nHealth Canada's Food Directorate has concluded that the current dietary exposure to BPA through food packaging uses is not expected to pose a health risk to the general population, including newborns and infants. However, due to the uncertainty raised in some animal studies relating to the potential effects of low levels of BPA, the Government of Canada is taking action to enhance the protection of infants and young children. It is therefore recommended that the general principle of ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) be applied to continue efforts on limiting BPA exposure from food packaging applications to infants and newborns, specifically from pre-packaged infant formula products as a sole source food and baby bottles, for this sensitive segment of the population.\nMedia reports and the FDA report have prompted concern in our marketplace among existing and potential customers. It is possible that developments surrounding this issue could lead to adverse effects on our business. Such developments could include:\n\u00b7 increased publicity that changes public or regulatory perception regarding packaging that uses BPA, so that significant numbers of consumers stop purchasing products that are packaged in polycarbonate plastic;\n\u00b7 the emergence of new scientific evidence that suggests that the low doses of BPA to which consumers may be exposed when using polycarbonate plastic is unsafe;\n\u00b7 interpretations of existing evidence by the FDA or other regulatory agencies that lead to prohibitions on the use of polycarbonate plastic as packaging for consumable products;\n\u00b7 the listing of BPA by California\u2019s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment on the state\u2019s Proposition 65 list, which would require us to label our products with information about BPA content and could obligate us to evaluate the levels of exposure to BPA associated with the use of our products; and\n\u00b7 the inability of sellers of consumable products to find an adequate supply of alternative packaging if polycarbonate plastic containing BPA becomes an undesirable or prohibited packaging material.\nIn addition, federal, state, provincial and local governmental authorities have and continue to introduce, and in certain states and provinces enact proposals intended to restrict or ban the use of BPA in food and beverage packaging materials.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our sales and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nLegislative and executive action in state and local governments enacting local taxes on bottled water to include multi-gallon bottled water could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nRegulations have been enacted or proposed in some localities where we operate to enact local taxes on bottled water. These actions are purportedly designed to discourage the use of bottled water due in large part to concerns about the environmental effects of producing and discarding large numbers of plastic bottles. While we have not to date directly experienced any adverse effects from these concerns, and we believe that our products are sufficiently different from those affected by recent enactments, there is no assurance that our products will not be subject to future legislative and executive action by state and local governments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in taxation requirements could affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to income tax in the numerous jurisdictions in which we generate net sales. In addition, our water dispensers we sell are subject to certain import duties and sales taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income and other tax rates could reduce our after-tax income from affected jurisdictions, while increases in indirect taxes could affect our products\u2019 and services\u2019 affordability and therefore reduce demand for our products and services.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards in the United States may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had net operating losses of approximately $134.1 million for federal income tax purposes, which expire at various dates through 2034. To the extent available and not otherwise utilized, we intend to use any net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the U.S. corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone certain changes in stock ownership. Our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited, under this section or otherwise, in the future. To the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited, our income could be subject to U.S. corporate income tax earlier and in amounts greater than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe value of our common stock could be volatile.\nThe overall market and the price of our common stock may fluctuate greatly. Shares of our common stock were sold in our November 2010 initial public offering at a price of $12.00 per share, and, as of March 6, 2015, our common stock has subsequently traded as high as $16.45 and as low as $0.69 per share. An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock may be significantly affected by various factors, including:\n\u00b7 quarterly fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in investors\u2019 and analysts\u2019 perception of the business risks and conditions of our business;\n\u00b7 our ability to meet the earnings estimates and other performance expectations of financial analysts or investors;\n\u00b7 unfavorable commentary or downgrades of our stock by equity research analysts; and\n\u00b7 general economic or political conditions.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAdditionally, we have filed a \u201cshelf\u201d registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we may sell common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and units at any time in one or more offerings up to a total public offering price of $75.0 million. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on December 10, 2014. The offer or sale of all or a portion of the above described securities may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of March 6, 2015, our executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 17% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In particular, Billy D. Prim, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns approximately 11% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of March 6, 2015. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have research coverage by four securities and industry analysts. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of Primo more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions:\n\u00b7 authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u00b7 eliminate the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent in most circumstances;\n\u00b7 eliminate the ability of our stockholders to remove a member of our Board of Directors without cause;\n\u00b7 eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders;\n\u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7 provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u00b7 establish a classified board of directors the members of which serve staggered three-year terms.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in a restatement of our financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our company and have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company. As a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nTesting and maintaining internal controls can divert our management's attention from other matters that are important to our business. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able or willing to issue an unqualified report if we conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as required by Section 404, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our company, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock, and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations in the future, which in turn could impact our ability to raise additional financing if needed in the future.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nRestrictive covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Notes restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions, which could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had a $15.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) and $20.0 million of term notes (the \u201cTerm Notes\u201d) with The Prudential Insurance Company of America and PICA Hartford Life Insurance Comfort Trust. Our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Notes contain various restrictive covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take certain actions. In particular, these agreements limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 incur additional indebtedness or otherwise guarantee the obligations of other persons;\n\u00b7 make restricted payments (including paying dividends on, redeeming or repurchasing capital stock);\n\u00b7 make certain expenditures, investments or acquisitions;\n\u00b7 create liens on our assets to secure debt;\n\u00b7 make certain prepayments without penalties;\n\u00b7 engage in certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7 apply the proceeds of certain debt and equity financing transactions at our discretion;\n\u00b7 engage in sale-and-leaseback or similar transactions;\n\u00b7 transfer or sell assets, merge, liquidate or wind-up; and\n\u00b7 change the general nature of our line of business.\nAny or all of these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities and to fund our operations. Any future debt could also contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those to be imposed under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Notes.\nA breach of a covenant or other provision in any debt instrument governing our current or future indebtedness could result in a default under that instrument and, due to customary cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions, could result in a default under any other debt instrument that we may have. If the lenders under our indebtedness were to so accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness, in which event we likely would seek reorganization or protection under bankruptcy or other, similar laws.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations. In addition, our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to support operations and other activities without debt financing could prevent future growth and success.\nOur ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend upon prevailing economic conditions and various financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us, or at all, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion, business acquisition plans and general operating activities, and are unable obtain the necessary funding for these items through debt financing, our business could be negatively affected and we may be unable to expand into existing and new markets. Our ability to generate cash flows is dependent in part upon obtaining necessary financing at favorable interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions may prevent us from doing so.\nGlobal capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors and customers.\nThe global capital and credit markets have experienced increased volatility and disruption in recent years, making it more difficult for companies to access those markets. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers, bottlers, distributors or retail customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.", "PERMNO": 12402, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "PRMW.1"}
