If any of the following risks actually occur, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price for your securities could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Commerce Bancshares, Inc.\nDifficult market conditions may affect the Company\u2019s industry.\nThe concentration of the Company\u2019s banking business in the United States particularly exposes it to downturns in the U.S. economy. While current economic conditions are favorable, there remain risks in that environment.\nIn particular, the Company may face the following risks in connection with market conditions:\n\u2022\nIn the current environment, accelerated job growth, lower unemployment levels, and improving credit conditions are expected to continue. However, adverse changes in this environment may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause declines in consumer credit usage, adverse changes in payment patterns, and higher loan delinquencies and default rates. These could impact the Company\u2019s future loan losses and provision for loan losses, as a significant part of the Company\u2019s business includes consumer and credit card lending.\n\u2022\nReduced levels of economic activity may cause declines in financial service transactions, including bank card, corporate cash management and other fee businesses, as well as the fees earned by the Company on such transactions.\n\u2022\nThe process used to estimate losses inherent in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans. If an instance occurs that renders these predictions no longer capable of accurate estimation, this may in turn impact the reliability of the process.\n\u2022\nCompetition in the industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions, thereby reducing market prices for various products and services which could in turn reduce Company revenues.\n\u2022\nThe U.S. economy is also affected by foreign economic events and conditions. Although the Company does not hold foreign debt, global economic conditions and political tensions affecting interest rates, business export activity, capital expenditures by businesses, and investor confidence may negatively affect the Company by means of reduced loan demand or reduced transaction volume with the Company.\nSignificant changes in banking laws and regulations could materially affect the Company\u2019s business.\nOver the past several years, a significant increase in bank regulation has occurred. A number of new laws and regulations have already been implemented, including those which reduced overdraft fees and credit card revenues, and eliminated the student loan business. Other major changes involved lending transparency, risk-based FDIC insurance assessments, and derivative clearing processes. These regulations generally resulted in lower revenues and higher compliance burdens. Regulatory focus continues today with emphasis on stress-testing and Basel III regulatory capital reform.\nFuture regulation, along with possible changes in tax laws and accounting rules, may have a significant impact on the way the Company conducts business, implements strategic initiatives, engages in tax planning and makes financial disclosures. Compliance with such regulation may divert resources from other areas of the business and limit the ability to pursue other opportunities.\nThe performance of the Company is dependent on the economic conditions of the markets in which the Company operates.\nThe Company\u2019s success is heavily influenced by the general economic conditions of the specific markets in which it operates. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides financial services primarily throughout the states of Missouri, Kansas, and central Illinois, and in its expansion markets in Oklahoma, Colorado and other surrounding states. As the Company does not have a significant banking presence in other parts of the country, a prolonged economic downturn in these markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant changes in federal monetary policy could materially affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its polices determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and interest rates earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest bearing deposits. Credit conditions are influenced by its open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the member bank discount rate, and bank reserve requirements. Changes in Federal Reserve Board policies are beyond the Company\u2019s control and difficult to predict, and such changes may result in lower interest margins and a continued lack of demand for credit products.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institution counterparties. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with these institutions include overnight and term borrowings, interest rate swap agreements, securities purchased and sold, short-term investments, and other such transactions. As a result of this exposure, defaults by, or rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and defaults by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client, while other transactions expose the Company to liquidity risks should funding sources quickly disappear. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could materially and adversely affect results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s asset valuation may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company uses estimates, assumptions, and judgments when certain financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. When such third-party information\nis not available, fair value is estimated primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact the Company\u2019s future financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment. In such cases, certain asset valuations may require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio values may be adversely impacted by deterioration in the credit quality of underlying collateral within the various categories of investment securities it owns.\nThe Company generally invests in securities issued by municipal entities, government-backed agencies or privately issued securities that are highly rated and evaluated at the time of purchase, however, these securities are subject to changes in market value due to changing interest rates and implied credit spreads. While the Company maintains rigorous risk management practices over bonds issued by municipalities, credit deterioration in these bonds could occur and result in losses. Certain mortgage and asset-backed securities (which are collateralized by residential mortgages, credit cards, automobiles, mobile homes or other assets) may decline in value due to actual or expected deterioration in the underlying collateral. Under accounting rules, when the impairment is due to declining expected cash flows, some portion of the impairment, depending on the Company\u2019s intent to sell and the likelihood of being required to sell before recovery, must be recognized in current earnings. This could result in significant non-cash losses.\nFuture loan losses could increase.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred at the balance sheet date within the existing portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations, specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. Although the loan losses have been stable in 2014 and 2013, an unforeseen deterioration of financial market conditions could result in larger loan losses, which may negatively affect the Company's results of operations and could further increase levels of its allowance. In addition, the Company\u2019s allowance level is subject to review by regulatory agencies, and that review could result in adjustments to the allowance. See the section captioned \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses\u201d in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report for further discussion related to the Company\u2019s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan loss.\nThe Company is subject to both interest rate and liquidity risk.\nWith oversight from its Asset-Liability Management Committee, the Company devotes substantial resources to monitoring its liquidity and interest rate risk on a monthly basis. The Company's net interest income is the largest source of overall revenue to the Company, representing 59% of total revenue at December 31, 2014. The interest rate environment in which the Company operates fluctuates in response to general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence loan originations, deposit generation, demand for investments and revenues and costs for earning assets and liabilities.\nAdditionally the Company manages its balance sheet in order to maximize its net interest income from its net earning assets while insuring that there is ample liquidity to meet fluctuating cash flows coming from either funding sources or its earning assets.\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, there has been significant growth in deposits from both consumers and businesses, and much of this growth has been invested in the investment securities portfolio. For the past several years, the Federal Reserve has maintained interest rates at unprecedented low levels, and as the securities portfolio has grown, interest margins have been pressured. The securities portfolio, which has averaged 45% of total earning assets over the past three years, generally carries lower rates than loans, Furthermore the Company attempts to diversify its securities portfolio while keeping duration short, in order to ensure it is always able to meet liquidity needs for future changes in loans or deposit balances. Loan demand has recently strengthened, growing 10% on average in 2013 and 9% in 2014, versus just 2% in 2012. During 2014, growth in loans was mainly funded by maturities of investment securities, and growth in deposits were mostly reinvested in the securities portfolio. At December 31, 2014, the Company's loan to deposit rate was 60%, a sign of strong liquidity.\nWhile further loan growth is expected under a strengthening economy, it is expected that interest margins will continue to be pressured if rates remain low. Should the demand for loans increase in the future while deposit balances decline significantly, the Company's liquidity risk could change, as it is dependent on the Company's ability to manage maturities within its investment portfolio to fund these changing cash flows.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nThe Company operates in the financial services industry, and has numerous competitors including other banks and insurance companies, securities dealers, brokers, trust and investment companies and mortgage bankers. Consolidation among financial service providers and new changes in technology, product offerings and regulation continue to challenge the Company's marketplace position. As consolidation occurs, larger regional banks may enter our market and add to existing competition. These new banks may lower fees in an effort to grow market share, which could result in a loss of customers and lower fee revenue for the Company. The Company must continue to make investments in its products and delivery systems to stay competitive with the industry as a whole, or its financial performance may suffer.\nThe Company\u2019s reputation and future growth prospects could be impaired if events occur which breach its customers\u2019 privacy.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business, and as part of its business, the Company maintains significant amounts of data about its customers and the products they use. Additionally, customers rely on online bank products. While the Company has policies and procedures and safeguards designed to prevent or limit the effect of failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurances that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur; or if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. In addition to unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks could overwhelm Company Web sites and prevent the Company from adequately serving customers. Should any of the Company's systems become compromised, the reputation of the Company could be damaged, relationships with existing customers may be impaired, the compromise could result in lost business, and as a result, the Company could incur significant expenses trying to remedy the incident. Similarly, because the Company is an issuer of both debit and credit cards, it is periodically exposed to losses related to security breaches which occur at retailers that are unaffiliated with Company (e.g., customer card data being compromised at retail stores). These include, but are not limited to, costs and expenses for card reissuance as well as losses resulting from fraudulent card transactions.\nThe Company may not attract and retain skilled employees.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people can be intense, and the Company spends considerable time and resources attracting and hiring qualified people for its various business lines and support units. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of the Company\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business because of their skills, knowledge of the Company\u2019s market, and years of industry experience, as well as the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.", "PERMNO": 25129, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CBSH"}
