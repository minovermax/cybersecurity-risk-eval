{"cik": "716133", "company": "CINCINNATI BELL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us. Our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially affected by any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 and related government, private sector and individual consumer responsive actions have adversely affected the Company\u2019s business operations, employee availability, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow and are expected to continue to do so for an unknown period of time.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, President Trump declared a national emergency relating to the outbreak. The outbreak has spread globally and has, and continues to, adversely affect workforces, customers and consumer sentiment and, along with a decrease in consumer spending, has led to an economic downturn in many markets. National, state and local authorities have recommended social distancing measures and have imposed and continue to consider quarantine and isolation measures for large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures. These measures, while intended to protect human life, have had, and are expected to continue to have, serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration. The effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts, including government payments to affected citizens and industries, is uncertain.\nIn the United States and in other countries and regions where we have a significant employee presence, facilities or critical operations, the outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted our ability to manage day-to-day operations and service our customers. It has also increased our costs of operations and resulted in, among other things, loss of revenue. For example, we have implemented corporate and personal travel restrictions for employees and vendors, cancelled events and enabled work-from-home for many employees by equipping them to safely support customers remotely. We have also implemented additional safety measures for our retail stores and field operations teams. Additionally, we have been required to temporarily close or reduce operations at some of our retail locations, facilities and customer call centers. Retail locations inside malls were closed temporarily, but reopened in June 2020 as stay-at-home orders began to ease in Ohio. Retail locations have remained open since June, but continue to have reduced hours of operation. Due to stay-at-home orders easing in the primary markets in which the Company operates, day-to-day operations have normalized as of the date of this filing, but the Company may be required to temporarily close or reduce operations at more of or all of its retail locations, facilities or call centers again if there is a resurgence of COVID-19 in the markets in which the Company operates. We expect the foregoing effects, and other effects of COVID-19, to continue for an unknown period of time.\nOur business has been, and is expected to continue to be, negatively impacted by the effects of, or precautions taken to avoid exposure to, COVID-19, such as reduced travel or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to self-quarantine, and by the resulting disruptions to economic conditions and financial markets. Such impacts include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nDisruptions to our third-party providers, including those who provide many of our information technology, call center functions, certain accounting functions and other critical vendor services;\n\u2022\nReduced workforces caused by, among other things, the temporary inability of the workforce to work due to illness, quarantine, or government mandates, or temporary unwillingness to work due to health concerns;\n\u2022\nReduced customer demand or customer payment of accounts receivables as a result of adverse economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nReduced availability of certain network equipment in the supply chain due to increased demand and certain suppliers who have had, or continue to have, workforce constraints due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\nReduced revenues as a result of our pledge to not terminate service to certain customers due to their inability to pay bills because of disruptions caused by COVID-19 and to waive late fees for certain customers as a result of circumstances related to COVID-19.\nPotential future impacts include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nIncreased supply chain risks such as increased scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;\n\u2022\nIncreased health insurance and labor-related costs arising from illness, quarantine and the implementation of social distancing and work-from-home measures;\n\u2022\nIncreased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us, our customers or other third parties as a result of employees or third-party vendors\u2019 employees working remotely; and\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\n\u2022\nIn the event of a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue or other event that impacts our employees\u2019 ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue to support our customers\u2019 needs and respond to inquiries through call center operations or to perform necessary repairs and maintenance.\nThe foregoing impacts, and other impacts of COVID-19 discussed elsewhere in these risk factors, are consistent with those generally affecting the economic, financial, regulatory and political conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world, and are generally applicable to the industries and markets in which the Company and our subsidiaries operate. These impacts could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our consumer and business sales and damage the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity position, possibly to a significant degree. The severity and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted because of the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and related factors, including the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers and suppliers.\nThe Company operates in highly competitive industries, and customers may not continue to purchase products or services, which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share.\nThe telecommunications industry is very competitive, and the Company competes against larger, well-capitalized national providers. Competitors may reduce pricing, create new bundled offerings, or develop new technologies, products or services that they can offer in expanded geographic regions. Our competitors are expected to continuously upgrade their service quality and offerings. If the Company cannot continue to offer reliable, competitively priced, value-added services, or if the Company does not keep pace with technological advances and upgrades, competitive forces could adversely affect it through a loss of market share or a decrease in revenue and profit margins. The Company has lost access lines and expects to continue to lose them as part of the customer base migrates to competitors or alternative products of the Company. These competitive factors could limit the Company's ability to grow revenue and cash flows despite the strategic initiatives implemented.\nThe Entertainment and Communications segment faces competition from other local exchange carriers, wireless service providers, inter-exchange carriers, cable, broadband and internet service providers, other telecom companies, niche fiber companies and companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Wireless providers, particularly those that provide unlimited wireless voice and data plans with no additional fees for long distance, offer customers a substitution for the Company\u2019s services. The Company believes wireless substitution accounts for the largest portion of its access line losses. Also, cable competitors that have existing service relationships with the Company's customers in the Entertainment and Communications segment offer substitution services, such as VoIP and long distance voice services in the Company's operating areas. As a result of wireless substitution and increased competition, legacy voice lines decreased by 11% and 10% in Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019.\nIn addition, our strategic products, particularly our fiber-based products, face competition from a number of different sources including cable operators, other telecom companies, niche fiber companies, and companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Increasingly, content owners are utilizing Internet-based delivery of content directly to consumers, some without charging a fee for access to the content. Furthermore, due to consumer electronics innovations, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices. Increased customer migration to these non-traditional entertainment products could result in increased churn and decreased penetration in our Consumer/SMB Fiber products. If the Company is unable to effectively implement strategies to attract and retain video and high-speed internet subscribers, retain access lines and long distance subscribers, or replace such customers with other sources of revenue, the Company's Entertainment and Communications segment will be adversely affected.\nThe IT Services and Hardware segment competes against numerous other information technology consulting, web-hosting, and computer system integration companies, many of which are large in scope and well-financed. Other competitors may consolidate with larger companies or acquire software application vendors or technology providers, which may provide competitive advantages. The Company believes that many of the participants in this market must grow rapidly and achieve significant scale to compete effectively. This consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that could impede our ability to compete successfully in the market. The competitive forces described above could adversely affect the Company\u2019s IT Services and Hardware segment and have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may be unable to grow its revenues and cash flows despite the initiatives it has implemented.\nWe must produce adequate revenues and cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facilities, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our capital expenditures, fund our pension and other employee benefit obligations and pay preferred dividends pursuant to our dividend policy. We have identified some potential areas of opportunity and implemented several growth initiatives. We cannot be assured that these opportunities will be successful or that these initiatives will improve our financial position or our results of operations. The outbreak of COVID-19 has, and may continue to, negatively impact these opportunities and require us to incur additional related costs such as overtime wages for employees that are working additional hours to offset employees that are following quarantine protocol, personal protective equipment for field technicians and customer facing employees, and pandemic related wages for certain employees, particularly if the effects of COVID-19 persist for a significant period of time.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nFailure to anticipate the need to introduce new products and services or to compete with new technologies may compromise the Company\u2019s success in the telecommunications industry.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in part, on being able to anticipate the needs of current and future business, carrier and consumer customers. The Company seeks to meet these needs through new product introductions, service quality and technological improvements. New products and services are important to the Company\u2019s success because our industry is technologically driven, such that new technologies can offer alternatives to the Company\u2019s existing services. The development of new technologies and products could accelerate the Company\u2019s loss of access lines or limit the growth from our strategic products, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s access lines, which generate a significant portion of its cash flows and profits, are decreasing in number. If the Company continues to experience access line losses similar to the past several years, its revenues, earnings and cash flows from operations may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company generates a substantial portion of its revenues by delivering voice and data services over access lines. The Company's local telecommunications subsidiaries have experienced substantial access line losses over the past several years due to a number of factors, including wireless and broadband substitution and increased competition. The Company expects access line losses to continue into the foreseeable future. Failure to retain access lines without replacing such losses with an alternative source of revenue would adversely impact the Company's revenues, earnings and cash flow from operations.\nThe Company has provided alternative sources of revenue by way of its strategic products; however, these products may generate lower profit margins than its traditional services. In addition, as a larger portion of our customer base has already migrated to these new product offerings, a decreased growth rate of strategic products can be expected. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that the revenues generated from our new offerings will mitigate revenue losses from the reduced sales of our legacy products or that our new strategic offerings will be as successful as anticipated.\nNegotiations with the providers of content for our video programming may not be successful, potentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels, which could result in the loss of subscribers. In addition, due to the influence of some content providers, we may be forced to pay higher rates for some content, resulting in increased costs.\nWe must negotiate with the content owners of the programming that we carry. These content owners are the exclusive provider of the channels they offer. If we are unable to reach a mutually-agreed upon contract with a content owner, our existing agreements to carry this content may not be renewed, resulting in the blackout of these channels. The loss of content could result in our loss of customers who place a high value on the particular content that is lost. In addition, many content providers own multiple channels. As a result, we typically have to negotiate the pricing for multiple channels rather than one, and carry and pay for content with which customers do not associate much value, in order to have access to other content with which customers do associate value. Some of our competitors have materially larger scale than we do and may, as a result, be better positioned than we are in such negotiations. As a result of these factors, the expense of content may continue to increase and have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's failure to meet performance standards under its agreements could result in customers terminating their relationships with the Company or customers being entitled to receive financial compensation, leading to reduced revenues and/or increased costs.\nThe Company\u2019s agreements with its customers contain various requirements regarding performance and levels of service. If the Company fails to provide the levels of service or performance required by its agreements, customers may be able to receive financial compensation or may be able to terminate their relationship with the Company. In order to provide these levels of service, the Company is required to protect against human error, natural disasters, equipment failure, power failure, sabotage and vandalism, and have disaster recovery plans available in the event of disruption of service. Additionally, in the event that a significant number of our field technicians are affected by COVID-19, our ability to maintain our network could be reduced or could require significant overtime by unaffected field technicians. The failure to address these or other events may result in a disruption of service. In addition, any inability to meet service level commitments or other performance standards could reduce the confidence of customers. Decreased customer confidence could impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenues and operating results.\nThe Company generates a substantial portion of revenue by serving a limited geographic area.\nThe Company generates a substantial portion of revenue by serving customers in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dayton, Ohio and the islands of Hawaii. An economic downturn or natural disaster occurring in any of these limited operating territories would have a disproportionate effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows compared to similar companies of a national scope and similar companies operating in different geographic areas. Furthermore, because of Hawaii\u2019s geographic isolation, the successful operation and growth of the business in Hawaii is dependent on favorable economic and regulatory conditions in the state. The impact of COVID-19 on the Hawaiian Islands has been, and could continue to be, more significant than in other geographies due to reliance on tourism by many businesses and reductions in tourism due to social distancing measures, self-quarantine requirements for visitors and recommendations of federal, state and local governments.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe customer base for telecommunications services in Hawaii is small and geographically concentrated. The population of Hawaii is approximately 1.4 million, approximately 70% of whom live on the island of Oahu. Any adverse economic conditions affecting Oahu (including the outbreak of COVID-19), or Hawaii generally, could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Labor shortages or increased labor costs in Hawaii could also have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may be subject to increased costs for goods and services that we are unable to control or defray as a result of operating in this limited territory. Increased expenses including, but not limited to, energy and health care could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOne large customer accounts for a significant portion of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable. The loss or significant reduction in business from this customer would cause operating results to decline and could negatively impact profitability and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Verizon Communications Inc. (\u201cVerizon\u201d) comprised 20% and 25% of consolidated accounts receivable, respectively. As a result of these concentrations, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected if the Company lost this customer or if products and services purchased were significantly reduced. In addition, if Verizon were to default on its accounts receivable obligations, the Company would be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established. This would also negatively impact the available borrowing capacity under the Company's accounts receivable securitization facility (\"Receivables Facility\").\nMaintaining the Company's telecommunications networks requires significant capital expenditures, and the Company's inability or failure to maintain its telecommunications networks could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s market share and ability to generate revenue.\nOver the past several years, the Company has improved its wireline network through increased capital expenditures for fiber optic cable in areas of its operating network. The Company intends to continue its capital expenditures for fiber optic cable.\nIn order to provide appropriate levels of service to the Company's customers, the network infrastructure must be protected against damage from human error, natural disasters, unexpected equipment failure, power loss or telecommunications failures, terrorism, sabotage or other intentional acts of vandalism. The Company's networks may not address all of the problems that may be encountered in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated problems, which may result in disruption of service to customers.\nThe Company may also incur significant additional capital expenditures as a result of unanticipated developments, regulatory changes and other events that impact the business.\nIncreases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers.\nVideo streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional internet activity such as web browsing and email. As utilization rates and availability of these services continue to grow, our high-speed internet customers may use much more bandwidth than in the past. If this continues to occur and our existing network capacity becomes unable to handle the increased demand, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers. We may not be able to recover the costs of the necessary network investments. This could result in an adverse impact to our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our networks.\nThe law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on, stored or disseminated through their networks is still unsettled. As such, we could be exposed to legal claims relating to content disseminated on our networks. Claims could challenge the accuracy of materials on our network or could involve matters such as defamation, invasion of privacy or copyright infringement. If we need to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks or are required to defend ourselves against such claims, our financial results would be negatively affected.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nAn IT and/or network security breach or cyber-attack may lead to unauthorized use or disabling of our network, theft of customer data or other sensitive data, unauthorized use or publication of our confidential business information and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failures or disruptions to our operations. Our inability to operate our wireline networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share. In addition, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Cyber-attacks, which include hacking, denial of service, use of malware, including ransomware and advanced persistent threats (APTs), and other means of unauthorized access or disruption of services, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. These risks may be further heightened as we expand our cloud-based and managed customer support businesses and reliance on internet-based services. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology, networks and data may be insufficient to repel a major cyber-attack in the future. Significant security failures could result in the unauthorized use or disabling of our network elements. The costs associated with a major cyber-attack could include material incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures, lost revenues from business interruption, litigation, fines from regulatory authorities and damage to our reputation. If we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as customer records and other sensitive information about the Company, including intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee data against security breaches, it could result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWeather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.\nOur business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. The potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.\nIn particular, from time to time, the islands of Hawaii experience severe weather conditions such as high winds and heavy rainfall and natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunami, which can overwhelm our employees, disrupt our services and severely damage our property. Such disruptions in service and damage to property could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or market price of our securities. Moreover, it is impossible to predict the extent to which climate change could cause extreme weather conditions to become more frequent or more extreme.\nThe Company depends on a number of third-party providers and the loss of or problems with one or more of these providers may impede the Company\u2019s growth, cause it to lose customers or materially and adversely impact its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on third-party providers to supply products and services. For example, many of the Company\u2019s information technology, call center functions and certain accounting functions are performed by third-party providers, some of which are located outside of the United States, and network equipment is purchased from and maintained by vendors. Additionally, certain installation services sold by our IT Services and Hardware segment are performed by third-party providers.\nGovernments, public institutions and other organizations in countries and regions where cases of COVID-19 have been detected have taken certain emergency measures to combat its spread and impact, including implementation of travel bans, suspension of public transportation and closures of factories, schools, public buildings, businesses and other institutions. As a result of such measures, our third-party off-shore call center was forced to reduce its hours of operation for several weeks, resulting in longer than normal hold times during that period. The call centers that support the Cincinnati market returned to normal hours of operation on April 28, 2020. The loss of, or further problems with, one or more of these third-party providers may result in an adverse effect on our ability to provide products and services to our customers. While the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is not yet known, potential effects on our business include disruptions to or restrictions on our third-party providers, suppliers and other vendors in our supply chain, including limitations on the ability of their employees to travel and temporary closures or reductions in the hours of their facilities or customer call centers.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our suppliers around the world, we may experience shortages, price increases or delays to the delivery of materials. We could be materially adversely impacted, including from any disruption to critical vendor services or losses of business, if any of our suppliers face significant business disruptions as a result of COVID-19 or any similar outbreak.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nMoreover, certain policies and statements by President Trump and senior government officials have given rise to uncertainty about the status of certain international trade agreements to which the United States is a party and the position of the United States with respect to international trade generally. The U.S. government has recently increased tariffs and imposed new tariffs on a wide range of products imported from China. It remains unclear what additional actions, if any, the current U.S. administration will take with respect to existing trade relationships. Additional trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us and to our suppliers based in the United States and may require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCyber-attacks or security breaches at third parties providing critical services or with access to or possession of sensitive data could also adversely impact business operations or result in regulatory actions, loss of customers, legal fees or increased costs, associated with incident response beyond current insurance limits. Cyber-attacks of technology that is used in the organizations supply-chain to provide network and IT services or that are resold to customers could also have the same adverse impacts.\nA failure of back-office information technology systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe efficient operation of the Company\u2019s business depends on back-office information technology systems. The Company relies on back-office information technology systems to effectively manage customer billing, business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. A failure of the Company\u2019s information technology systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and result in a failure to collect accounts receivable, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing the Company\u2019s reputation and results of operations to suffer. In addition, information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company\u2019s control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nIf the Company fails to extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements with its labor unions when they expire, or if the Company\u2019s unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, the Company\u2019s business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nThe Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with its labor unions in both the Cincinnati and Hawaii operating territories, which represents approximately 25% of the Company\u2019s employees. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements in the future. If the Company fails to extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with its union arise, or if its unionized workers engage in a strike or a work stoppage, the Company could experience a significant disruption of operations or incur higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the business.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nThe Company\u2019s debt could limit its ability to fund operations, raise additional capital, and fulfill its obligations, which, in turn, would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses and prospects generally.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company and our subsidiaries had outstanding indebtedness of $1,971.7 million, on which it incurred $134.2 million of interest expense in 2020 and had a total shareowners\u2019 deficit of $191.1 million. In October 2017, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a five-year $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility including both a letter of credit subfacility of up to $30 million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to $25 million (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") and (ii) a seven-year $600 million senior secured term loan facility (the \"Tranche B Term Loan due 2024\"). At December 31, 2020, the Company and our subsidiaries had $4.1 million of borrowing availability under the Receivables Facility and had the ability to borrow up to an additional $133.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to compliance with certain conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s debt has important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe Company is required to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nthere is a variable interest rate on a portion of its debt which will increase if the market interest rates increase;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s debt increases its vulnerability to adverse changes in the credit markets, which adverse changes could increase the Company's borrowing costs and limit the availability of financing;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s debt service obligations limit its flexibility to plan for or react to changes in its business and the industries in which it operates;\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s level of debt and shareowners\u2019 deficit may restrict it from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s debt instruments contain limitations on the Company and require the Company to comply with specified financial ratios and other restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants, if not cured or waived, could limit availability to the cash required to fund the Company's operations and general obligations and could result in the Company\u2019s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.\nIn addition, certain of the Company\u2019s variable rate debt, including debt under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Facility, uses LIBOR as one of the benchmarks for establishing the rate of interest and may be hedged with LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives. LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of U.S. Dollar LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors. While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new U.S. Dollar LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to be used entirely, to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of the Company\u2019s variable rate indebtedness.\nThe Company\u2019s creditors and preferred stockholders have claims that are superior to claims of the holders of the Company's common stock. Accordingly, in the event of the Company\u2019s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization, payment is first made on the claims of creditors of the Company and our subsidiaries, then preferred stockholders, and finally, if amounts are available, to holders of the Company's common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s credit agreement, the indenture governing the Company's notes due 2024, the indenture governing the Company's notes due 2025 and other indebtedness impose significant restrictions on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s debt instruments impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on the Company. These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nguarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase equity interests;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissue or sell capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; and\n\u2022\nchange our fiscal year.\nThe agreements governing the Credit Agreement also require the Company to achieve and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios.\nThe restrictions contained in the terms of the Credit Agreement and our other debt instruments could:\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict the Company\u2019s activities or business plans; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to finance our operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, other capital needs, or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nA breach of any of the debt's restrictive covenants or the Company\u2019s inability to comply with the required financial ratios would result in a default under some or all of the debt agreements. During the occurrence and continuance of a default, lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Additionally, under the Credit Agreement, the lenders may elect not to provide loans under the Revolving Credit Facility until such default is cured or waived. The Company\u2019s debt instruments also contain cross-acceleration provisions, which generally cause each instrument to be subject to early repayment of outstanding principal and related interest upon a qualifying acceleration of any other debt instrument. Failure to comply with these covenants, if not cured or waived, would limit the cash available to the Company required to fund operations and our general obligations and could result in the Company\u2019s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.\nThe Company depends on its revolving credit facility and receivables facility to provide for its short-term financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations, and the availability of those funds may be reduced or limited.\nThe Company depends on the Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Facility to provide for short-term financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of October 2022. The Receivables Facility has a termination date of May 2023 and is subject to renewal every 364 days, with the next renewal occurring in May 2021.\nThe Company's ability to borrow under its Revolving Credit Facility is subject to the Company's compliance with covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios. Failure to satisfy these covenants would constrain or prohibit our ability to borrow under these facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $67.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $133.0 million in additional borrowing availability under this facility. The $200.0 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility is funded by various financial institutions. If one or more of these banks is not able to fulfill its funding obligations, the Company\u2019s financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had a total borrowing capacity of $200.0 million on a maximum borrowing capacity of $200.0 million on our Receivables Facility. At that date, there were $182.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $13.9 million of outstanding letters of credit. The available borrowing capacity is calculated monthly based on the amount and quality of outstanding accounts receivable and thus may be lower than the maximum borrowing limit. If the quality of the Company\u2019s accounts receivables deteriorates, this will negatively impact the available capacity under this facility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $4.1 million of borrowing capacity remaining under its Receivables Facility.\nThe servicing of the Company\u2019s indebtedness is dependent on its ability to generate cash, which could be impacted by many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, including the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, many of which are beyond its control. The Company cannot provide assurance that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that additional sources of debt financing will be available or that future borrowings will be available under its Revolving Credit Facility or Receivables Facility, in each case, in amounts sufficient to enable the Company to service its indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If the Company cannot service its indebtedness, the Company will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital, which may adversely affect its shareholders, debt holders and customers. The Company may not be able to negotiate remedies on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict the Company from adopting any of these alternatives. The Company\u2019s inability to generate the necessary cash flows could result in its dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.\nThe Company depends on the receipt of dividends or other intercompany transfers from its subsidiaries and investments.\nVirtually all of the Company's operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and most of the Company's debt is held at the parent company. Certain of the Company's material subsidiaries are subject to regulatory authority which may potentially limit the ability of such subsidiaries to distribute funds or assets. If any of the Company's subsidiaries were to be prohibited from paying dividends or making distributions, the Company may not be able to make the scheduled interest and principal repayments on our debt. This failure would have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and the trading price of the Company's common stock, preferred stock, and debt instruments, which could result in its dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nThe uncertain economic environment, including uncertainty in the U.S. and world securities markets, could impact the Company's business and financial condition.\nThe uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an economic downturn, including increased unemployment and a decrease in consumer and commercial activity that may continue for an extended period of time. The Company\u2019s primary source of cash is customer collections. As a result of current adverse economic conditions and uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, some customers have cancelled or requested discounts on future contracted services or have had difficulty paying their accounts receivable. Additional customers may cancel or request discounts on future contracted services or have difficulty paying their accounts receivable, especially if economic conditions worsen. In response to the negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has pledged to not terminate service to any residential or small business customers because of their inability to pay their bills due to the disruptions caused by COVID-19 and to waive any late fees that any residential or small business customers would incur because of economic circumstances related to COVID-19 through June 30, 2020. This pledge has resulted and could continue to result in lower revenues, and has resulted, and could continue to result, in increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts due to future collection risk, which has negatively affected our results of operations and could continue to negatively affect our results of operations in the future. Furthermore, the sales cycle has been lengthened, and could be further lengthened, due to business customers slowing spending and/or delaying decision-making on the Company\u2019s products and services, which has adversely affected, and could further adversely affect, revenues. Some competitors have lowered prices or offered promotions as a result of economic conditions, and others may do so as well, which has exerted, and could further exert, pricing pressure on the Company. If the economies of the U.S. and the world continue to deteriorate, this could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdverse changes in the value of assets or obligations associated with the Company\u2019s employee benefit plans could negatively impact shareowners\u2019 deficit and liquidity.\nThe Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for eligible management employees, non-management employees and certain former executives. The Company also provides healthcare and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. The Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets indirectly reflect the value of all plan assets and benefit obligations under these plans. The accounting for employee benefit plans is complex as is the process of calculating the benefit obligations under the plans. Adverse changes in interest rates or market conditions, among other assumptions and factors, could cause a significant increase in the Company\u2019s benefit obligations or a significant decrease of the asset values, without necessarily impacting the Company\u2019s net income. In addition, the Company\u2019s benefit obligations could increase significantly if it needs to unfavorably revise the assumptions used to calculate the obligations. These adverse changes could have a significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s shareowners\u2019 deficit. Additionally, the Company\u2019s postretirement costs are adversely affected by increases in medical and prescription drug costs. Further, if there are adverse changes to plan assets or if medical and prescription drug costs increase significantly, the Company could be required to contribute additional material amounts of cash to the plans or to accelerate the timing of required payments.\nThe trading price of the Company's common stock may be volatile, and the value of an investment in the Company's common stock may decline.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this report and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as volatility in equity markets and fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to the Company. The Company\u2019s recent stock price reflects the assumption that the MIP Merger, as defined below, will be completed or a new offer will proceed to an agreement and an acquisition will be completed.\nEquity markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the Company\u2019s stock price and the market prices of equity securities of many other companies. These market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions, may negatively affect the market price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has also caused severe disruption in financial and equity markets in the United States and abroad. Uncertainty around the duration of business disruptions and the extent of the spread of the virus could continue to adversely impact the national or global economy and may negatively affect the market price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nCompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of common shares have periodically been subject to securities class action litigation. The Company may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and/or damages and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nRisks Related to the Merger with Macquarie Infrastructure Partners\nThere are material uncertainties and risks associated with the MIP merger agreement and Transaction.\nOn March 13, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMIP Merger Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which the Company will be acquired by an affiliate of Macquarie Infrastructure Partners V (\u201cMIP\u201d), a fund managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (the \u201cMIP Merger\u201d). Below are material uncertainties and risks associated with the MIP Merger Agreement and the proposed MIP Merger. If any of the risks develop into actual events, then the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results and ongoing operations, share price or prospects could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nThe announcement or pendency of the MIP Merger may impede the Company\u2019s ability to retain and hire key personnel (including senior management team and key sales associates) and its ability to maintain relationships with its customers, suppliers and others with whom we do business or our operating results and business generally;\n\u2022\nThe attention of the Company\u2019s employees and management may be diverted due to activities related to the MIP Merger, which may affect the Company\u2019s business operations;\n\u2022\nMatters relating to the transactions may require substantial commitments of time and resources by the Company\u2019s management, which could harm the Company\u2019s relationships with its employees, customers, distributors, suppliers or other business partners, and may result in a loss of or a substantial decrease in purchases by its customers;\n\u2022\nThe MIP Merger Agreement restricts the Company from engaging in certain actions without the approval of MIP, which could prevent the Company from pursuing certain business opportunities outside the ordinary course of business that arise prior to the closing of the MIP Merger;\n\u2022\nThe MIP Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of the Company;\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the MIP Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company\u2019s shareholders generally, which could have influenced their decisions to support or approve the MIP Merger;\n\u2022\nShareholder litigation in connection with the transactions contemplated by the MIP Merger Agreement may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability; and\n\u2022\nThe MIP Merger may materially limit the Company\u2019s ability to utilize existing deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating losses.\nThe Transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all.\nCompletion of the MIP Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including (1) the absence of an order, injunction or law prohibiting the MIP Merger, (2) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period (including any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (3) approval of the MIP Merger by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States under Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and (4) certain FCC consents and state regulatory consents required in connection with the MIP Merger, including consent by the Committee, shall have been obtained, shall not be subject to agency reconsideration or judicial review, and the time for any person to petition for agency reconsideration or judicial review shall have expired.\nAt this time, it is not possible for the Company to predict the outcome of ongoing regulatory reviews at the federal and state levels, including whether regulatory entities may condition approval of the MIP Merger on any specific mitigation arrangement or other conditions. Any such mitigation arrangement or condition may result in additional compliance obligations that may affect the Company\u2019s expenses and business operations in the future. In addition, the MIP Merger Agreement may require the Company and MIP to comply with conditions imposed by regulatory entities, and neither company is required to take any action with respect to obtaining any regulatory approval that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on MIP and its affiliates (taken as a whole) or the Company and our subsidiaries (taken as a whole). There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the MIP Merger. There can be no assurance that all of these required approvals and clearances will be obtained or will be obtained on a timely basis. The COVID-19 outbreak may also result in delays to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals required to consummate the MIP Merger.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe obligation of each of the Company and MIP to consummate the MIP Merger is also conditioned on, subject to certain materiality and other qualifiers, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party and the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the MIP Merger Agreement. Competing offers or acquisition proposals for the Company may be made, resulting in delay of the MIP Merger or termination of the MIP Merger Agreement. Lawsuits have been and may be filed against the Company relating to the MIP Merger and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the MIP Merger from being completed in the time frame expected or at all. While the MIP Merger Agreement is not subject to any financing condition, if MIP fails to obtain debt financing, the MIP Merger is unlikely to be consummated. Each of the Company and MIP has the right to terminate the MIP Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, as described in the MIP Merger Agreement.\nFailure to complete the Transaction could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial results and stock price.\nIf the MIP Merger is delayed or not completed, the Company\u2019s ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and will be subject to several risks and consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\ndecline in share price to the extent that the current price of Company common shares reflects an assumption that the MIP Merger will be completed;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity and a negative impression of the Company in the investment community;\n\u2022\nloss of business opportunities and the ability to effectively respond to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022\nthe Company may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay MIP a termination fee and additional expenses.\nThe Company has incurred, and will incur, substantial direct and indirect costs as a result of the Transaction.\nThe Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional advisors, printing and other transaction costs in connection with the MIP Merger, and some of these fees and costs are payable by the Company regardless of whether the MIP Merger is consummated.\nIntellectual Property, Tax, Regulatory, and Litigation Risks\nThe Company\u2019s future cash flows could be adversely affected if it is unable to fully realize its deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had deferred tax assets of $331.1 million, which are primarily composed of deferred tax assets associated with U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $197.5 million, and state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $42.4 million. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to certain state and local net operating losses and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the Company\u2019s ability to utilize the assets within the statutory expiration period. The use of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets enables it to satisfy current and significant future tax liabilities without the use of the Company\u2019s cash resources. If the Company is unable for any reason to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize its deferred tax assets, or if the use of its net operating loss carryforwards is limited by Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or similar state statutes, the Company\u2019s net income, shareowners\u2019 deficit and future cash flows would be adversely affected.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations, and actions by federal, state and local taxing authorities related to the interpretation and application of such tax laws and regulations, could have a negative impact on the Company's financial results and cash flows.\nThe Company calculates, collects and remits various federal, state, and local taxes, surcharges, and regulatory fees to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including but not limited to federal Universal Service Fund contributions, sales tax, regulatory fees and use tax on purchases of goods and services used in our business. Tax laws are subject to change, and new interpretations of how various statutes and regulations should be adhered to are frequently issued. In many cases, the application of tax laws are uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against the Company\u2019s new and evolving technologies and services. In the event that we have incorrectly calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts due to governmental authorities, or if revenue and taxing authorities disagree with positions we have taken, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions. In the event that federal, state, or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes on goods and services used to construct and maintain our network, operations, or provision of services, or seek to impose new taxes, there could be a material adverse impact on financial results.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe regulation of the Company\u2019s businesses by federal and state authorities may, among other things, place the Company at a competitive disadvantage, restrict our ability to price our products and services competitively, and threaten our operating licenses.\nSeveral of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to regulatory oversight of varying degrees at both the state and federal levels, which may differ from the regulatory scrutiny faced by the Company\u2019s competitors. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from pricing plans that are subject to regulatory review and approval. These regulated pricing plans limit the rates the Company can charge for some services while the competition has typically been able to set rates for services with limited or no restriction. In the future, regulatory initiatives that would put the Company at a competitive disadvantage or mandate lower rates for our services would result in lower profitability and cash flows for the Company. In addition, different regulatory interpretations of existing regulations or guidelines may affect the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses in future periods.\nAt the federal level, the Company\u2019s telecommunications services are subject to the Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d). In addition, the Company\u2019s submarine cable facilities and operations are also subject to requirements imposed by the national security and law enforcement agencies (e.g., the Departments of Justice, Defense and Homeland Security). At the state level, Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC (\u201cCBT\u201d) operates as the incumbent local exchange carrier (\u201cILEC\u201d) and carrier of last resort in portions of Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, while Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. (\u201cHTI\u201d) serves as the ILEC and carrier of last resort in Hawaii. As the ILEC in those states, these entities are subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commissions in those states. Various regulatory decisions or initiatives at the federal or state level may from time to time have a negative impact on CBT\u2019s and HTI\u2019s ability to compete in their respective markets. In addition, although less heavily regulated than the Company\u2019s ILEC operations, other subsidiaries are authorized to provide competitive local exchange service, long distance, and cable television service in various states, and consequently are also subject to various state and federal telecommunications and cable regulations that could adversely impact their operations.\nThere are currently many regulatory actions under way and being contemplated by federal and state authorities regarding issues, including national security and law enforcement matters that could result in significant changes to the business conditions in the telecommunications industry. On April 4, 2020, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 13913 Establishing the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector (the \u201cCommittee\u201d), which formalized the ad-hoc foreign investment review process (formerly referred to as \u201cTeam Telecom\u201d) applicable to FCC licenses and transactions. The Executive Order empowers the Committee to review FCC license and transfer applications involving foreign participation to determine whether grant of the requested license or transfer approval may pose a risk to the national security or law enforcement interests of the United States, and to review existing licenses to identify any additional or new risks to national security or law enforcement interests that did not exist when a license was first granted. Following an investigation, the Committee may recommend that the FCC revoke or modify existing licenses or deny or condition approval of new licenses and license transfers. It is not possible for the Company to determine whether it may be subject to a proceeding to revoke or modify our existing licenses or predict the outcome of a review of new license or transfer applications by the Committee in the future. A review of existing licenses and/or a review of new licenses and transfers by the Committee may result in additional compliance obligations that may affect the Company\u2019s expenses and business operations in the future.\nIn addition, in connection with our internet access offerings, we could become subject to laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the internet. There is currently only limited regulation applicable to these services although court decisions, legislative action and/or changes in regulatory policy could lead to greater regulation of the internet (including internet access services). The Company cannot provide any assurances that changes in current or future regulations adopted by the FCC or state regulators, or other legislative, administrative, or judicial initiatives relating to the telecommunications industry, will not have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, different regulatory agencies conduct audits to ensure that the Company is in compliance with the respective regulations. The Company could be subject to fines and penalties if found to be out of compliance with these regulations, and these fines and penalties could be material to the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThird parties may claim that the Company is infringing upon their intellectual property, and the Company could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.\nThe Company may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, products or services. Any litigation growing out of third-party patents or other intellectual property claims could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the Company\u2019s management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increases these risks. Resolution of claims of intellectual property infringement might also require the Company to enter into costly license agreements. Likewise, the Company may not be able to obtain license agreements on acceptable terms. The Company also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Further, the Company often relies on licenses of third-party intellectual property for its businesses. The Company cannot ensure these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThird parties may infringe upon the Company\u2019s intellectual property, and the Company may expend significant resources enforcing its rights or suffer competitive injury.\nThe Company\u2019s success significantly depends on the competitive advantage it gains from our proprietary technology and other valuable intellectual property assets. The Company relies on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets protections, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. If the Company fails to successfully enforce its intellectual property rights, its competitive position could suffer, which could harm its operating results.\nThe Company may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police its intellectual property rights. The Company may not be able to detect third-party infringements and its competitive position may be harmed before the Company does so. In addition, competitors may design around the Company\u2019s technology or develop competing technologies. Furthermore, some intellectual property rights are licensed to other companies, allowing them to compete with the Company using that intellectual property.\nThe Company could be subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require the Company to pay significant damages or settlements.\nThe industry that the Company operates in faces a substantial risk of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, securities class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection processes. Additionally, while preventative measures such as social distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing personal protective equipment including masks and gloves are being taken by our field technicians, the risk of inadvertent transmission of COVID-19 through human interaction could still occur and result in litigation in states in which we operate, with the exception of Ohio. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards and settlements.\nThe Ohio legislature passed House Bill 606, which became effective December 16, 2020, providing for Qualified Civil Immunity due to COVID-19 from March 9, 2020, through September 30, 2021. The bill significantly limits legal exposure to Ohio businesses, which, absent a showing of reckless, intentional, or willful or wanton misconduct, would not be liable to customers, employees, or others for actions or omissions resulting in the exposure to, or transmission or contraction of, COVID-19. The bill also flatly bars class actions based in whole or in part on allegations that a health care provider, business, government entity, or person caused exposure to, or the transmission or contraction of COVID-19.\nThe Company could incur significant costs resulting from complying with, or potential violations of, environmental, health and human safety laws.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health, and human safety, including those governing the management and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and the clean-up of contamination, and the emission of radio frequencies. While the Company believes its operations are in substantial compliance with environmental, health, and human safety laws and regulations, as an owner or operator of property and in connection with the current and historical use of hazardous materials and other operations at its sites, the Company could incur significant costs resulting from complying with or violations of such laws, the imposition of clean-up obligations and third-party suits. For instance, a number of the Company\u2019s sites formerly contained underground storage tanks for the storage of used oil and fuel for back-up generators and vehicles.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.", "PERMNO": 47677, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "CBB"}
