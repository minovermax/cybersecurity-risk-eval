Prestige beauty brands are expected to contribute significantly to our growth. We focus on developing and launching quality fragrances utilizing internationally renowned brand names. By identifying and concentrating in the most receptive market segments and territories where our brands are known, and executing highly targeted launches that capture the essence of the brand, we have had a history of successful launches. Certain fashion designers and other licensors choose us as a partner, because our Company\u2019s size enables us to work more closely with them in the product development process as well as our successful track record.\nGrow portfolio brands through new product development and marketing. We grow through the creation of fragrance family extensions within the existing brands in our portfolio. Every year or two, we create a new family of fragrances for each brand in our portfolio. We frequently introduce \u201cseasonal\u201d fragrances as well. With new introductions, we leverage our ability and experience to gauge trends in the market and further leverage the brand name into different product families in order to maximize sales and profit potential. We have had success in introducing new fragrance families (sub-brands, flanker brands or flankers) within our brand franchises. Furthermore, we promote the smooth and consistent performance of our prestige fragrance operations through knowledge of the market, detailed analysis of the image and potential of each brand name, a \u201cgood dose\u201d of creativity and a highly professional approach to international distribution channels.\nContinue to add new brands to our portfolio, through new licenses or acquisitions. Prestige brands are the core of our business and we intend to add new prestige beauty brands to our portfolio. Over the past twenty years, we have built our portfolio of well-known prestige brands through acquisitions and new license agreements. We intend to further build on our success in prestige fragrances and pursue new licenses and acquire new brands to strengthen our position in the prestige beauty market. To that end, during 2014, we signed fragrance licenses for Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister brands, and in 2015, we signed the fragrance license for Coach and French Connection, extended our Montblanc fragrance license and purchased the Rochas brand. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $260 million, which we believe should assist us in entering new brand licenses or outright acquisitions. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any future agreements, or acquire brands or assets on terms favorable to us, or if we do, that any such transaction will be successful. We identify prestige brands that can be developed and marketed into a full and varied product families and, with our technical knowledge and practical experience gained over time, take licensed brand names through all phases of concept, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution.\nExpand existing portfolio into new categories. We intend to continue to broaden our product offering beyond the fragrance category and offer other fragrance related products and personal care products under some of our existing brands. We believe such product offerings meet customer needs and further strengthen customer loyalty.\nContinue to build global distribution footprint. Our business is a global business and we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. In order to adapt to changes in the environment and our business, we have formed and are operating joint ventures or distribution subsidiaries in the major markets of the United States, Italy, Spain and Germany for distribution of prestige fragrances. We may look into future joint ventures arrangements or acquire distribution companies within other key markets to distribute certain of our prestige brands. While building a global distribution footprint is part of our long-term strategy, we may need to make certain decisions based on the short-term needs of the business. We believe that in certain markets, vertical integration of our distribution network may be one of the keys to future growth of our Company, and ownership of such distribution should enable us to better serve our customers\u2019 needs in local markets and adapt more quickly as situations may determine.\nProduction and Supply\nThe stages of the development and production process for all fragrances are as follows:\n\u25cf Simultaneous discussions with perfume designers and creators (includes analysis of esthetic and olfactory trends, target clientele and market communication approach)\n\u25cf Concept choice\n\u25cf Produce mock-ups for final acceptance of bottles and packaging\n\u25cf Receive bids from component suppliers (glass makers, plastic processors, printers, etc.) and packaging companies\n\u25cf Choose suppliers\n\u25cf Schedule production and packaging\n\u25cf Issue component purchase orders\n\u25cf Follow quality control procedures for incoming components; and\n\u25cf Follow packaging and inventory control procedures.\nSuppliers who assist us with product development include:\n\u25cf Independent perfumery design companies (Aesthete, Carr\u00e9 Basset, PI Design, Cent Degres)\n\u25cf Perfumers (IFF, Givaudan, Firmenich, Robertet, Takasago, Mane) which create a fragrance consistent with our expectations and, that of the fragrance designers and creators\n\u25cf Bottle manufacturers (Pochet du Courval, SGD , Verreries Brosse, Bormioli Luigi, Stoelzle Masni\u00e8res), caps (Qualipac , ALBEA , RPC, Codiplas, Jackel , CMSI) or boxes (Edelmann, Autajon , Alliora, Nortier , Draeger)\n\u25cf Production specialists who carry out packaging (CCI, Edipar , Jacomo, SDPP, MF Productions, Biopack) or logistics (SAGA for storage, order preparation and shipment)\nSuppliers' accounts for our European operations are primarily settled in euro and for our United States operations, suppliers' accounts are primarily settled in U.S. dollars. For our European operations, prestige fragrances, components and contract filling needs are purchased from many different suppliers located around the world. For United States operations, components for our prestige fragrances are primarily sourced, produced and filled in the United States, and our mass market products are primarily manufactured, produced or filled in the United States or China.\nMarketing and Distribution\nOur products are distributed in over 100 countries around the world through a selective distribution network. For the majority of our international distribution, we contract with independent distribution companies specializing in luxury goods. In each country, we designate anywhere from one to three distributors on an exclusive basis for one or more of our name brands. We also distribute our products through a variety of duty free operators, such as airports and airlines and select vacation destinations.\nAs our business is a global one, we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. For distribution of brands within our European based operations we operate through our distribution subsidiaries in the major markets of the United States, Italy, Spain and Germany. Our third party distributors vary in size depending on the number of competing brands they represent. This extensive and diverse network together with our own distribution subsidiaries provides us with a significant presence in over 100 countries around the world.\nApproximately 40% of our European based prestige fragrance net sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe business of our European operations has become increasingly seasonal due to the timing of shipments by our majority-owned distribution subsidiaries to their customers, which are weighted to the second half of the year.\nFor our United States operations, we distribute product to approved retailers and distributors in the United States as well as internationally, including duty free and other travel-related retailers. We utilize our in house sales team to reach our third party distributors and customers outside the United States. In addition, the business of our United States operations has become increasingly seasonal as shipments are weighted toward the second half of the year.\nGeographic Areas\nUnited States export sales were approximately $66.3 million, $61.0 million and $58.8 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Consolidated net sales to customers by region are as follows:\nConsolidated net sales to customers in major countries are as follows:\nCompetition\nThe market for prestige fragrance products is highly competitive and sensitive to changing preferences and demands. The prestige fragrance industry is highly concentrated around certain major players with resources far greater than ours. We compete with an original strategy, regular and methodical development of quality fragrances for a growing portfolio of internationally renowned brand names.\nInventory\nWe purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers based on internal estimates of anticipated need for finished goods, which enables us to meet production requirements for finished goods. We generally deliver product to customers within 72 hours of the receipt of their orders. Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers which manufacture the finished product for us and then deliver them to one of our distribution centers.\nProduct Liability\nOur United States operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of $5.0 million, and our European operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of \u20ac20.0 million (approximately $22.2 million). Based upon our experience, we believe this coverage is adequate and covers substantially all of the exposure we may have with respect to our products. We have never been the subject of any material product liability claims.\nGovernment Regulation\nA fragrance is defined as a \u201ccosmetic\u201d under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. A fragrance must comply with the labeling requirements of this FDC Act as well as the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and its regulations. Some of our color cosmetic products may contain menthol and are also classified as a \u201cdrug\u201d. Under U.S. law, a product may be classified as both a cosmetic and a drug. Additional regulatory requirements for products which are \u201cdrugs\u201d include additional labeling requirements, registration of the manufacturer and the semi-annual update of a drug list. In addition, various jurisdictions prohibit the use of certain ingredients in fragrances and cosmetics.\nOur fragrances are subject to the approval of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as a result of the use of specially denatured alcohol. So far we have not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required approvals.\nOur fragrance products that are manufactured or sold in Europe are subject to certain regulatory requirements of the European Union, such as Cosmetic Directive 76/768/CEE and Regulation number 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, but as of the date of this report, we have not experienced any material difficulties in complying with such requirements.\nTrademarks\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names. We have licenses or other rights to use, or own, the material trademark and brand name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products both in the United States and in other countries where such products are principally sold. Therefore, trademark and brand name protection is important to our business. Although most of the brand names we license, use or own are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or brand name protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our trademarks and brand names may be substantial.\nUnder various license and other agreements we have the right to use certain registered trademarks throughout the world (except as otherwise noted) for fragrance products. These registered trademarks include:\n\u25cf Abercrombie & Fitch\n\u25cf Agent Provocateur\n\u25cf Anna Sui\n\u25cf Balmain\n\u25cf Banana Republic\n\u25cf bebe\n\u25cf Boucheron\n\u25cf Coach\n\u25cf Dunhill\n\u25cf French Connection\n\u25cf FCUK\n\u25cf Hollister\t\n\u25cf Jimmy Choo\n\u25cf Jordache\n\u25cf Karl Lagerfeld\n\u25cf Montblanc\n\u25cf Oscar de la Renta\n\u25cf Paul Smith\n\u25cf Repetto\n\u25cf Shanghai Tang\n\u25cf S.T. Dupont\n\u25cf Van Cleef & Arpels\nIn addition, we are the registered trademark owner of several trademarks for fragrance products, including:\n\u25cf Aziza\n\u25cf Rochas\n\u25cf Intimate\n\u25cf Lanvin\n\u25cf Tristar, Regal Collections, Royal Selections and Apple\nEmployees\nAs of March 1, 2016, we had 311 full-time employees worldwide. Of these, 223 are full-time employees of our European operations, with 62 employees engaged in sales activities and 161 in administrative, production and marketing activities. Our United States operations have 88 employees, and of these, 14 were engaged in sales activities and 74 in administrative, production and marketing activities. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider these risk factors before you decide to purchase or sell shares of our common stock. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made by us. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe are dependent upon the continuation and renewal of various licenses and other agreements for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of one or more licenses or agreements could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAll of our rights relating to prestige fragrance brands, other than Lanvin and Rochas, are derived from licenses or other agreements from unaffiliated third parties, and our business is dependent upon the continuation and renewal of such licenses and other agreements on terms favorable to us. Each license or agreement is for a specific term and may have additional optional terms. Generally, each license is subject to us making required royalty payments (which are subject to certain minimums), minimum advertising and promotional expenditures and meeting minimum sales requirements. Other agreements are generally subject to meeting minimum sales requirements. Just as the loss of a license or other significant agreement may have a material adverse effect on us, a renewal on less favorable terms may also negatively impact us.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a prolonged downturn or recession in the United States, Europe or other countries in which we conduct business.\nA prolonged economic downturn or recession in the United States, Europe, China or any of the other countries in which we do significant business could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, such a downturn or recession could adversely impact (i) the level of spending by our ultimate consumers, (ii) our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from certain customers, (iii) our ability of certain suppliers to fill our orders for raw materials, packaging or co-packed finished goods on a timely basis, and (iv) the mix of our product sales.\nConsumers may reduce discretionary purchases of our products as a result of a general economic downturn.\nWe believe that the high degree of global economic uncertainty could have a negative effect on consumer confidence, demand and spending. In addition, we believe that consumer spending on beauty products is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, we may experience sustained periods of declines in sales during periods of economic downturn as it may affect consumer purchasing patterns. In addition, a general economic downturn may result in reduced traffic in our customers\u2019 stores which may, in turn, result in reduced net sales to our retail store customers. Any resulting material reduction in our sales could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nUncertainties and deterioration in global credit markets, as evidenced by reductions in sovereign credit ratings in the United States and Europe, could negatively impact suppliers, customers and consumers, which could have an adverse impact on our business as a whole.\nUncertainties and continued deterioration in the global credit markets as evidenced by previous reductions in sovereign credit ratings in the United States and Europe, could negatively impact our suppliers, customers and consumers which, in turn, could have an adverse impact on our business. While thus far, uncertainties in global credit markets have not significantly affected our access to credit due to our strong credit rating, a further deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive. Such lack of credit or lack of credit on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our intangible assets, such as trademarks and licenses, become impaired, we may be required to record a significant non-cash charge to earnings which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nUnder United States generally accepted accounting principles, we review our intangible assets, including our trademarks and licenses, for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be fully recoverable. The carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable due to factors such as reduced estimates of future cash flows, including those associated with the specific brands to which intangibles relate, or slower growth rates in our industry. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a long-term financial outlook of our operations and the specific brands to which the intangible assets relate. However, actual performance in the near-term or long-term could be materially different from these forecasts, which could impact future estimates and the recorded value of the intangibles. Any significant impairment to our intangible assets would result in a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which the impairment is determined to exist.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, specifically trademarks and brand names, our ability to compete could be negatively impacted.\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with trademarks and brand names that we license, use or own. We have licenses or other rights to use, or own, the material trademark and brand name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products both in the United States and in other countries where such products are principally sold. Therefore, trademark and brand name protection is important to our business. Although most of the brand names we license, use or own are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or brand name protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our trademarks and brand names may be substantial.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of the Company\u2019s products or the unauthorized diversion by third parties of the Company\u2019s products could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nThird parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of the Company\u2019s products. These counterfeit products may be inferior in terms of quality and other characteristics compared to the Company\u2019s authentic products and/or the counterfeit products could pose safety risks that the Company\u2019s authentic products would not otherwise present to consumers. Consumers could confuse counterfeit products with the Company\u2019s authentic products, which could damage or diminish the image, reputation and/or value of the Company\u2019s brands and cause consumers to refrain from purchasing the Company\u2019s products in the future, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation.\nOur success depends on our ability to operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the trademarks, patents, copyrights and proprietary rights of other parties.\nOur commercial success depends at least in part on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the trademarks, patents, copyrights and other proprietary rights of others. However, we cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate such rights. Many companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage, and to the extent we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we may also face a greater risk of being the subject of such litigation. For these and other reasons, third parties may allege that our products, services or activities infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademark, patent, copyright or other proprietary rights. Defending against allegations and litigation could be expensive, take significant time, divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and delay getting our products to market. In addition, if we are found to be infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third party trademark, patent, copyright or other proprietary rights, we may need to obtain a license, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or redesign or rebrand our products, which may not be possible. We may also be required to pay substantial damages or be subject to a court order prohibiting us and our customers from selling certain products or engaging in certain activities. Our inability to operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the trademarks, patents, copyrights and proprietary rights of others could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our products is dependent on public taste.\nOur revenues are substantially dependent on the success of our products, which depends upon, among other matters, pronounced and rapidly changing public tastes, factors which are difficult to predict and over which we have little, if any, control. In addition, we have to develop successful marketing, promotional and sales programs in order to sell our fragrances and fragrance related products. If we are not able to develop successful marketing, promotional and sales programs, then such failure will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to extreme competition in the fragrance industry.\nThe market for fragrance products is highly competitive and sensitive to changing market preferences and demands. Many of our competitors in this market are larger than we are and have greater financial resources than are available to us, potentially allowing them greater operational flexibility. Our success in the prestige fragrance industry is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate original strategies and develop quality products that are in accord with ongoing changes in the market.\nIf there is insufficient demand for our existing fragrance products, or if we do not develop future strategies and products that withstand competition or we are unsuccessful in competing on price terms, then we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to acquire or license additional brands, or obtain the required financing for these agreements and arrangements, then the growth of our business could be impaired.\nOur future expansion through acquisitions or new product license or distribution arrangements, if any, will depend upon the capital resources and working capital available to us. Further, in view of the global banking crisis, we may be unable to obtain financing or credit that we may require for additional licenses, acquisitions or other transactions. We may be unsuccessful in identifying, negotiating, financing and consummating such acquisitions or arrangements on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could hinder our ability to increase revenues and build our business. Just as the loss of a license or other significant agreement may have a material adverse effect on us, our failure to acquire rights to new brands may also negatively impact us.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that we may not be able to successfully integrate or manage. These acquisitions may dilute our stockholders and cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities.\nWe continuously review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings, increase our size and geographic scope of operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities. The financing, if available, for any of these acquisitions could significantly dilute our stockholders and/or result in an increase in our indebtedness. We may acquire or make investments in businesses or products in the future, and such acquisitions may entail numerous integration risks and impose costs on us, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from acquired businesses\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers\n\u25cf risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience\n\u25cf dilutive issuances of equity securities\n\u25cf incurrence of substantial debt\n\u25cf assumption of contingent liabilities\n\u25cf incurrence of significant amortization expenses related to intangible assets and the potential impairment of acquired assets and\n\u25cf incurrence of significant immediate write-offs.\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nJoint ventures or strategic alliances in geographic markets in which we have limited or no prior experience may expose us to additional risks.\nWe review, and from time to time may establish, joint ventures and strategic alliances that we believe would complement our current product offerings, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities. These business relationships may require us to rely on the local expertise of our partners with respect to market development, sales, local regulatory compliance and other matters. Further, there may be challenges with ensuring that such joint ventures and strategic alliances implement the appropriate internal controls to ensure compliance with the various laws and regulations applicable to us as a U.S. public company. Accordingly, in addition to commercial and operational risk, these joint ventures and strategic alliances may entail risks such as reputational risk and regulatory compliance risk. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable alliance or joint venture candidates, that we will be able to consummate any such alliances or joint ventures on favorable terms, or that we will realize the anticipated benefits of entering into any such alliances or joint ventures.\nWe are dependent upon Messrs. Jean Madar and Philippe Benacin, and the loss of their services could harm our business.\nJean Madar, our Chief Executive Officer, and Philippe Benacin, our President and Chief Executive Officer of Interparfums SA, are responsible for day-to-day operations as well as major decisions. Termination of their relationships with us, whether through death, incapacity or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, and we cannot assure you that qualified replacements can be found. We do not maintain key man insurance on the lives of Messrs. Madar or Benacin, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to retain suitable replacements for either Mr. Madar or Mr. Benacin.\nOur reliance on third party manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe rely on outside sources to manufacture our fragrances and cosmetics. The failure of such third party manufacturers to deliver either compliant, quality components or finished goods on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we believe there are alternate manufacturers available to supply our requirements, we cannot assure you that current or alternative sources will be able to supply all of our demands on a timely basis. We do not intend to develop our own manufacturing capacity. As these are third parties over whom we have little or no control, the failure of such third parties to provide components or finished goods on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur reliance on third party distributors could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe sell a substantial percentage of our prestige fragrances through independent distributors specializing in luxury goods. Given the growing importance of distribution, we have modified our distribution model by owning a controlling interest in certain of our distributors within key markets. However, we have little or no control over third party distributors and the failure of such third parties to provide services on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if we replace existing third party distributors with new third party distributors or with our own distribution arrangements, then transition issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTerrorist attacks, acts of war or military actions and/or other civil unrest may adversely affect the territories in which we operate, and our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTerrorist attacks such as those that have occurred, most recently in Paris, France where we have our European headquarters, and previously in Libya, Spain, England and the United States, and attempted terrorist attacks, military responses to terrorist attacks, other military actions, or governmental action in response to or in anticipation of a terrorist attack, or civil unrest as occurring in the Middle East and the Ukraine, may adversely affect prevailing economic conditions, resulting in work stoppages, reduced consumer spending or reduced demand for our products. These developments subject our worldwide operations to increased risks and, depending on their magnitude, could reduce net sales and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe loss of or disruption in our distribution facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe currently have one distribution facility in Paris and one in New Jersey. The loss of one or both of those facilities, as well as the inventory stored in those facilities, would require us to find replacement facilities and assets. In addition, acts of God, such as extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and the like or terrorist attacks, could disrupt our distribution operations. If we cannot replace our distribution capacity and inventory in a timely, cost-efficient manner, then such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies. Changes in the laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, environmental or climate change laws, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products. If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers\u2019 standards, then our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and/or become subject to liability claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks related to our foreign operations.\nWe operate on a global basis, with a substantial portion of our 2015 net sales and net income generated outside the United States, and we anticipate for the foreseeable future that a substantial portion of our net sales and net income will be generated outside the United States. We intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely, except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without incurring material incremental tax obligations. A substantial portion of our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments that result from these earnings remain outside the United States. We maintain offices in 7 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the United States that warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world. Foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022 changes in foreign laws, regulations and policies, including restrictions on trade, import and export license requirements, and tariffs and taxes, as well as changes in United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment; and\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions, social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in foreign tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flows.\nIn addition to being subject to taxation in the United States, we are subject to income and other taxes in other foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. From time to time, tax proposals are introduced or considered by the United States Congress or the legislative bodies in foreign jurisdictions that could also affect our tax rate, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, or our other tax liabilities. Our tax liabilities are also affected by the amounts we charge for inventory, services, licenses, funding, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, and other items in intercompany transactions. A negative determination or ultimate disposition in any tax audit, changes in tax laws or tax rates, or the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets could materially affect our tax provision, net income and cash flows in future periods.\nThe international character of our business renders us subject to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and international trade tariffs, barriers and other restrictions.\nA substantial portion of our European operations\u2019 net sales (approximately 40%) are sold in U.S. dollars. In an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations, we engage in a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Despite such actions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the euro, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, which could be imposed by the United States, other countries or the European Union might also have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business is subject to governmental regulation, which could impact our operations.\nFragrance products must comply with the labeling requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act as well as the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and their regulations. Some of our color cosmetic products may also be classified as a \u201cdrug\u201d. Additional regulatory requirements for products which are \u201cdrugs\u201d include additional labeling requirements, registration of the manufacturer and the semi-annual update of a drug list. In addition, various jurisdictions prohibit the use of certain ingredients in fragrances and cosmetics.\nOur fragrances are subject to the approval of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as a result of the use of specially denatured alcohol. So far we have not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required approvals.\nOur fragrance products that are manufactured or sold in Europe are subject to certain regulatory requirements of the European Union, such as Cosmetic Directive 76/768/CEE and Regulation number 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, but as of the date of this report, we have not experienced any material difficulties in complying with such requirements.\nHowever, we cannot assure you that, should we use proscribed ingredients in our fragrance products that we develop or market, or develop or market fragrance products with different ingredients, or should existing regulations or requirements be revised, we would not in the future experience difficulty in complying with such requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages and other risks.\nWe have information systems that support our business processes, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and intra-company communications. We also have Internet websites in the United States and Europe. These systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur failure to protect our reputation, or the failure of our partners to protect their reputations, could have a material adverse effect on our brand images.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our various brand images. Our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity or if we, or the third parties with whom we do business, do not comply with regulations or accepted practices. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, such as animal testing, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, including applicable U.S. trade sanctions, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. We are also dependent on the reputations of our brand partners and licensors, which can be affected by matters outside of our control. Damage to our reputation or the reputations of our brand partners or licensors or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nOur business is subject to seasonal variability.\nThe business of our European operations has become increasingly seasonal due to the timing of shipments by our majority-owned distribution subsidiaries to their customers, which are weighted to the second half of the year. Accordingly, our financial performance, sales, working capital requirements, cash flow and borrowings generally experience variability during the third and fourth quarters. Any substantial decrease in net revenues, in particular during periods of increased sales due to seasonality, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance.\nOur business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales and earnings per share. Accordingly, we provide guidance as to our expected net sales, and earnings per share, which is updated as appropriate throughout the year. While we generally provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter if called for, we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. In addition, longer-term guidance that we may from time to time provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable. Such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations.\nIn all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our sales and/or earnings expectations or expectations regarding other initiatives, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect. Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release (by reference to our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission) and in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q). These and other factors may make it difficult for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.\nOutside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period. Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse or adopt their predictions as to our future performance. Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations. If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected. Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.\nWe may become subject to possible liability for improper comparative advertising or \u201cTrade Dress\u201d.\nBrand name manufacturers and sellers of brand name products may make claims of improper comparative advertising or trade dress (packaging) with respect to the likelihood of confusion between some of our mass market products and those of brand name manufacturers and sellers. They may seek damages for loss of business or injunctive relief to seek to have the use of the improper comparative advertising or trade dress halted. However, we believe that our displays and packaging constitute fair competitive advertising and are not likely to cause confusion between our products and others. Further, we have not experienced to any material degree, any of such problems to date.", "PERMNO": 11884, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "IPAR"}
