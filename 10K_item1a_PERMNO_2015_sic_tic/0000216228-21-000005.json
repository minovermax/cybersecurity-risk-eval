{"cik": "216228", "company": "ITT Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance. Because of these factors, past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future results. You should carefully consider, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the risks and uncertainties described below. These risk factors may have an adverse material effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In addition to these risks, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to most or all companies.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nRISK 1: Our financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental and market reactions to COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting measures by federal, state and local governments to contain the outbreak have caused, and continue to cause, significant disruptions in our businesses and in global markets where we operate. These disruptions have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to the occurrence of the following:\n\u2022partial or full closure of our offices or manufacturing facilities, either voluntarily or in response to government mandates, including as a result of an outbreak of COVID-19 that directly affects our workforce;\n\u2022lower production capacity and labor productivity due to employee illness, loss of key personnel, increased absenteeism, inability to travel, or the implementation of government mandated or voluntary preventative measures such as reductions in operating hours;\n\u2022reduced sales related to decreased customer demand and spending, order push-outs, order cancellations or unfavorable pricing dynamics;\n\u2022missed or late deliveries due to disruptions in our global supply chain, delayed supplier deliveries, or the inability to procure supplier inputs at reasonable prices or at all;\n\u2022delays in collections or an inability to collect on customer receivables;\n\u2022customer or supplier bankruptcy;\n\u2022liquidity challenges including an inability to pay suppliers and vendors;\n\u2022difficulty accessing capital markets;\n\u2022increasing indebtedness due to our need to increase borrowing to fund operations during a period of reduced revenue; and\n\u2022delays in capital investments or research and development.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance will depend on future developments that are not within our control, including, but not limited to, the severity and duration of the pandemic, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines or other medical remedies against COVID-19, the effectiveness of government stimulus programs, the severity of a resurgence of COVID-19 or new strains of the virus, the extent to which people continue to work from home, restrictions on or people's attitudes towards travel, and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. At this time, we cannot predict the duration or full magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, the various governmental containment measures or the resulting disruptions to our markets and our business. The longer the pandemic continues, including a resurgence or a more severe wave, the more likely that the foregoing risks will be realized and that other negative impacts on our business will occur, including some that we are unable to currently predict.\nRISK 2: Our exposure to pending and future asbestos claims and related liabilities, assets, and cash flows is subject to significant uncertainties.\nSubsidiaries of ITT, ITT LLC (f/k/a ITT Corporation) and Goulds Pumps LLC (f/k/a Goulds Pumps, Inc.), have been sued, along with many other companies, in numerous lawsuits in which the plaintiffs claim damages for personal injury arising from exposure to asbestos from component parts of certain products sold or distributed by various defendants, including certain ITT subsidiaries and we expect similar lawsuits to be filed in the future. As such, we record an estimated liability related to pending claims and claims that we estimate will be filed in the future based on a number of key assumptions, including the likelihood of suits being filed, claim acceptance rates, disease type, settlement values and defense costs. These assumptions are derived from ITT\u2019s experience in resolving asbestos claims and reflect our expectations about future claim activities.\nIn addition, we record an asset that represents our best estimate of probable recoveries from our insurers for the estimated asbestos liabilities. There are significant assumptions made in developing estimates of asbestos-related recoveries, such as policy triggers, policy or contract interpretation, the methodology for allocating claims to policies, and the continued solvency of the Company\u2019s insurers. All of our primary insurance policies are exhausted, which may result in higher net cash outflows until excess carriers begin accepting claims for reimbursement. Performance by our insurers could differ from the assumptions underlying the recognized asset and could result in lower collections of receivables than are currently expected. Lower collections of receivables would increase the Company\u2019s asbestos costs. In addition, insurance recoveries may vary significantly from period to period, and the recovery rate is expected to decline over time due to gaps in our insurance coverage, reflecting uninsured periods, the insolvency of certain insurers, prior settlements with our insurers and our expectation that certain insurance policies will exhaust over time.\nDue to these uncertainties, it is difficult to predict the ultimate cost, including potential recoveries, of resolving pending and unasserted asbestos claims. Changes in estimates related to these uncertainties may result in increases or decreases to the net asbestos liability, particularly if the quality, number of claims, or settlement or defense costs change significantly, if there are significant developments in the trend of case law or court procedures, or if legislation or another alternative solution is implemented. The resolution of asbestos claims may take many years. Adverse future events affecting the Company's asbestos costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in any given period.\nRISK 3: Our operating results and our ability to maintain liquidity or procure capital may be adversely affected by unfavorable or uncertain global economic and capital market conditions.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience volatility in revenues, operating results and profitability due to uncertain global economic and capital market conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic. We have undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of markets and expansion of the geographic regions in which we operate. The end markets we serve include automotive, aerospace, oil and gas, industrial, mining, chemical, and defense, each of which is impacted by specific industry and general economic cycles. Important factors impacting our businesses include, but are not limited to, the overall strength of the global\neconomy and our customers\u2019 confidence in local and global macroeconomic conditions, industrial spending, tax rates, interest rates, the availability of commercial financing, and regulations and tariffs in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Instability in the global credit markets and geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets or regions deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our financial statements.\nWe closely monitor the credit-worthiness of our insurers and customers and evaluate their ability to meet their obligations. However, adverse changes to financial conditions could jeopardize these counterparty obligations. A tightening of credit markets may reduce funds available to our customers to pay for our products and services for a prolonged and perhaps unknown period of time. Restrictive credit markets may also result in customers extending terms for payment and may result in our having higher customer receivables with increased risk of default.\nShould market conditions deteriorate, this may also adversely affect our ability to manage inventory levels and maintain current levels of profitability. If, for any reason, we lose access to commercial paper markets or our currently available lines of credit, or if we are required to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or we may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms. Deteriorating market conditions could also indicate an impairment in the value of our goodwill and intangible assets in one or more of our reporting units which would require us to recognize a non-cash charge to our Statement of Operations. We test both goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nRISK 4: We are subject to inherent business risks due to our operations and sales outside the U.S. and in emerging markets.\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing portion of our operations and are a strategic focus for continued future growth. Our strategy calls for increasing sales in overseas markets, including emerging markets such as Mexico, South America, China, Russia, and the Middle East. In 2020, 67% of our total sales were to customers operating outside of the United States. Our sales from international operations and export sales are subject to varying degrees of risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States. These risks include the following, some of which could be impacted by changes in international trade agreements or the imposition or increase of tariffs or trade sanctions between the United States and other countries:\n\u2022possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;\n\u2022restrictions, regulations, or tax liabilities on currency repatriation;\n\u2022potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;\n\u2022the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;\n\u2022our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff in these regions; and\n\u2022changes in tariffs and trade barriers, sanctioned countries and individuals, and import and export licensing requirements.\nOur operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties, including risks that governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds, impose or increase withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, seek to nationalize our assets, or impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. In addition, emerging markets pose other uncertainties, including challenges to our ability to protect our intellectual property, pressure on the pricing of our products, and risks of political instability.\nThe cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable profit margins.\nRISK 5: Significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.\nA significant portion of our sales are to customers operating outside the U.S.; therefore, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our results of operations. The primary currencies to which we have exposure are the Euro, Czech koruna, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, South Korean won, and the Chinese renminbi. From time to time, we may enter into derivative contracts to hedge some of these foreign currency exposures. However, our hedging strategy may fail to reduce our exposure or could result in unfavorable impact to our operating results.\nAny significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the U.S. dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also impact our results when the currency of a transaction differs from the functional currency of our operating unit, or when financial statements in the functional currency of non-U.S. operating units are translated into U.S. dollars.\nRISK 6: Our business is impacted by our customers' levels of capital investment and maintenance expenditures, particularly in the oil and gas, chemical, and mining markets.\nDemand for certain industrial products and services depends on the level of capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures of our customers. Our customers\u2019 levels of capital expenditures depend, in turn, on general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries, volatility in commodity prices, expectations of future market behavior, and their liquidity and financial position. The ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by factors independent of the conditions in their industries, such as the condition of global credit and capital markets. Some of our customers may also choose to postpone capital investment and maintenance, even during favorable conditions in their industries or markets, which could lead to the delay or cancellation of orders.\nThe businesses of many of our customers, particularly those in the oil and gas, chemical, and mining industries, which represented approximately 9%, 10%, and 3%, respectively, of our 2020 revenue, are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may in the future experience, periodic downturns of varying severity. For example, the volatility of the oil and gas market has generally been dependent upon the prevailing view of future gas and oil prices, which are influenced by numerous supply and demand factors, including availability and cost of capital, global and domestic economic conditions, environmental regulations, policies of OPEC countries and Russia, and other factors. Actions taken by Saudi Arabia and Russia and the COVID-19 pandemic have caused a worldwide oversupply in oil and gas, resulting in significant reductions in oil and gas prices. Our customers in these industries, particularly those whose demand for our products and services is primarily profit-driven, historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Additionally, fluctuating energy demand forecasts and commodity pricing and other macroeconomic factors may cause our customers to be more conservative in their capital planning, which could reduce demand for our products and services. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in our industry. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISK 7: Failure to compete successfully and innovate and quality issues with our products could adversely affect our business.\nWe provide products and services to competitive markets. We believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product performance, reliability and innovation, application expertise, brand reputation, energy efficiency, product life cycle cost, timeliness of delivery, proximity of service centers, effectiveness of distribution channels and price.\nMaintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing, research and development, engineering, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. We may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products, or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors.\nWe manufacture key components that are integral to the operation of systems and manufacturing processes in the markets we serve. The reliability and performance of our products are critically important to our customers and the users of their products. Accordingly, quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the potentially costly consequences of product failure. Our quality certifications, including products manufactured to military specifications, are critical to the marketing success of our goods and services. Our success in part depends on our ability to manufacture to exact tolerances precision-engineered components, subassemblies, and finished devices from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality components will be harmed, our competitive advantage could be damaged, and we could lose customers, market share or our ability to sell certain products.\nRISK 8: Our business could be adversely affected by raw material price volatility and the inability of suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements.\nOur business relies on third-party suppliers for raw materials, components and contract manufacturing services to produce our products. The supply of raw materials to the Company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or the required materials have historically been readily available. In limited instances we depend on a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to a limited number of suppliers. While we believe we could obtain and qualify alternative sources for most sole and limited source supplier materials, if necessary, the transition to an alternative source could be complex, costly, and protracted, especially if the change requires us to redesign our systems. Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, including the COVID-19 pandemic, production interruptions at suppliers, capacity constraints, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, the ability of suppliers to meet regulatory requirements and suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers. Any delay in our suppliers\u2019 abilities to provide us with sufficient quality or flow of materials or any supplier price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers. In addition, commodity prices and the prices for other raw materials necessary for production have, and may continue to have, significant fluctuations. We may not be able to pass along increased raw material and component prices to our customers in the form of price increases or our ability to do so could be delayed.\nRISK 9: If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services effectively, our revenue, gross margin and profitability could suffer. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from a single customer.\nWe bring our products and services to market using a variety of sales channels, including a broad network of distributors, agents, and value-added resellers. Each distribution method has distinct risks and profit margins, and our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and profit margins. Changes to the sales channels could introduce additional complexity to our sales and inventory management processes and could cause disruptions or create channel conflicts.\nWe may be impacted by the loss of or delays caused by a distributor, the loss or deterioration of some distribution or reseller arrangements, channel conflicts, including the consolidation of third-party distributors, or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. Some of our distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, leading to a slowness or difficulty in the cash collection process. Distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Our reliance on indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to end-customer demand, generating a time lag to the market trend with potential negative impacts on inventory levels and strategic decisions, including pricing, capital deployment, and operational decisions.\nSales to Continental, ITT's largest customer, were approximately 9% of our total revenue in 2020. A significant portion of the OEM revenue, typically about half, is derived at the automakers' direction to use an ITT brake pad in Continental's braking systems (calipers), generally through supply agreements signed directly with automakers. The remaining Continental revenue is generated from a long term aftermarket agreement. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nRISK 10: Failure to retain our existing senior management, engineering and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business.\nOur success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain or attract a significant number of employees in senior management and engineering and other key personnel. The ability to attract or retain employees will depend on our ability to offer competitive compensation, training and cultural benefits. We will need to continue to develop a roster of qualified talent to support business growth and replace departing employees. A failure to retain or attract highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate or grow our business.\nRISK 11: A material business interruption, particularly at one of our manufacturing facilities, could negatively impact our ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.\nIf operations at one of our manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of an equipment failure, natural disaster, power outage, fire, explosion, act of terrorism, war, IT system failure, cyber-attack, adverse weather\nconditions, labor disputes, epidemic or pandemic illness (including without limitation, COVID-19), relocation of production location, or any other reason, our ability to meet customer demand for our products may be impacted. We have business continuity plans in place to mitigate the effects of such interruptions, but these plans may not be sufficient to resolve the issues in a timely manner. A significant interruption in production capability could also require us to make substantial payments due to non-performance. We also have insurance for certain covered losses which we believe to be adequate to offset a significant portion of the costs for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as certain financial losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown. However, any recovery under our insurance policies would be subject to deductibles and, depending on the coverage, may not offset the lost revenues or increased expenses that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.\nRISK 12: Our inability to protect our own intellectual property rights, or unintentionally violating the intellectual property rights of others could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nObtaining, maintaining and enforcing our proprietary rights is critical to the success of our business. For certain products and manufacturing processes, we rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements and other contracts to protect these rights. These contracts may be breached, or may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling similar products, and therefore could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, during the normal course of business, we could unintentionally infringe or violate the proprietary rights of others. Intellectual property litigation could be time consuming for management, and could result in significant legal expense to either pursue claims against others, or to defend ourselves. If we are unable to protect our patents, trademarks, or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe or violate the rights of others, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRISK 13: Our operations could be disrupted and our business could be materially and adversely affected by our inability to prevent, detect or adequately respond to cyber security breaches.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties. In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store confidential information, including proprietary business information belonging to us, our customers, suppliers, business partners and other third parties and personally identifiable information of our employees.\nOur information technology systems and those of third party service providers may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, cyber-attacks, and user errors. While we actively manage the risks to our information systems that are within our control, we can provide no assurance that our actions or those of our third party service providers will be successful in eliminating or mitigating risks to our systems, networks or data. If we experience a disruption in our information technology systems, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could materially adversely affect our business. Even the most well-protected information systems are vulnerable to internal and external security breaches including, but not limited to, those by computer hackers and cyber terrorists utilizing techniques such as phishing, ransomware or denial of service attacks. As a provider of products and services to government and commercial customers, and particularly as a government contractor, we are subject to a heightened risk of security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism, including by foreign governments and cyber terrorists. Furthermore, information technology security threats are increasing in sophistication, intensity, and frequency. A security breach may occur, including breaches that we may be unable to detect. The unavailability of our information systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could cause significant disruption to our business or could result in decreased performance and increased costs.\nThe processing and storage of certain information is increasingly subject to privacy and data security regulations, and many such regulations are country-specific. The interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are uncertain, evolving and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Compliance with these various laws (including California's Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020) may be onerous and require us to incur substantial costs or to change our business practices in a manner that adversely affects our business, while failure to comply with such laws may subject us to substantial penalties. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in 2018, imposed significant new requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance\nIf we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our security processes and procedures and our compliance with evolving privacy and data security regulations and government cyber security requirements for government contractors, potentially causing us to lose business. A breach could also result in the loss of our intellectual property, potentially impacting our long-term\ncapability to compete for sales of affected products. In addition, a breach of security of our information systems could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability, as well as increased costs to implement further information security measures. If we are unable to prevent, detect or adequately respond to cyber security breaches, our operations could be disrupted and our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISK 14: Increased scrutiny from investors, lenders, and other market participants regarding our environmental, social and governance, or sustainability responsibilities could expose us to additional costs and adversely impact our liquidity, results of operations, reputation, employee retention, and stock price.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers and other key stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors. Some investors may use ESG criteria to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate.\nThe ESG factors by which companies\u2019 corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change. This could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. If we are unable to satisfy new corporate responsibility criteria, investors may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. We risk damage to our brand and reputation in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. Furthermore, if our competitors\u2019 corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding ESG matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors and other key stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation, employee retention and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us, financial results, and stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISK 15: Portfolio management strategies for growth, including cost-saving initiatives, may not meet expectations, and past divestitures and spin-offs may expose us to potential liabilities.\nWe regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through the acquisition of other companies, assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing businesses. Although we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating and financial condition of the businesses we purchase, a level of risk remains regarding the actual operating condition of these businesses. Until we actually assume operating control of these businesses and their operations, we may not be able to ascertain the actual value or understand the potential liabilities of, or challenges facing, the acquired businesses and their operations. Acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial results, and business, including that an acquired business could under-perform relative to our expectations, the failure to realize expected synergies, difficulty in the integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems, the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities, potentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired company that could impact us on a consolidated basis, diversion of management attention from other businesses, loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, increased capital requirements and customer dissatisfaction.\nOur portfolio reviews also include the potential for cost-saving initiatives through restructuring and other initiatives. We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with certain initiatives, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization; (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities; and (iii) restructuring and realignment actions. Cost savings expectations are inherently uncertain and, therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve any expected, or any actual cost savings. Our restructuring activities may place substantial demands on our management, which could lead to the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business priorities and result in a reduced customer focus. In addition, restructuring activities may result in a loss of knowledge or expertise or could negatively impact employee performance and retention. If any of these outcomes occur, it could have a material adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nWe have divested a number of businesses, including as part of spin-offs in 1995 and 2011. With respect to some of these former businesses, we have contractually agreed to indemnify the counterparties against, or otherwise retain, certain liabilities, including, for example certain lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims, asbestos claims, or environmental matters. Even without ongoing contractual indemnification obligations, we could be exposed to liabilities arising out of such divestitures. In addition, the counterparties to those divestitures may have agreed to indemnify us or assume certain liabilities relating to those divestitures. Similarly, there can be no\nassurance that the indemnity or assumption of liability by the counterparties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these liabilities, or that a counterparty will be able to fully satisfy its obligations. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that a counterparty agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering any amounts for which we were initially held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nRISK 16: Tariffs remain uncertain and may continue to have a negative impact to our business.\nBeginning in 2018, the U.S. government undertook a series of actions to increase tariffs on certain goods imported into the U.S., including steel and aluminum, and in response governments in Europe and China have imposed retaliatory tariffs on various goods, including on certain goods we sell into those countries. These tariffs have negatively impacted the price of certain parts and materials we purchase to be included in the finished products we sell in the U.S., as well as the cost of the final product when re-exported. Since announced, we have been managing these impacts and will continue attempting to mitigate the impact of these tariffs by lowering input costs through pricing and supply chain actions, efficient utilization of our global manufacturing footprint, and supplier and customer negotiations and diversification strategies. However, we expect that continued trade disputes between the U.S. and Europe, China, and other countries, and other governmental actions related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies may continue to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers and suppliers.\nRISK 17: We are subject to risks related to government contracting, including changes in levels of government spending and regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the U.S. government.\nOur Connect & Control Technologies and Motion Technologies segments derive a portion of their revenue from sales to U.S. government customers and higher tier contractors who sell to the U.S. government. The government's expenditures are subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints, which may result in significant unexpected changes in levels of demand for our products. In addition, the award, administration and performance of government contracts is subject to regulatory and contractual requirements that differ significantly from the terms and conditions that apply to contracts with our non-governmental customers. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to audits and investigations to evaluate our compliance with these requirements. If we are found to have failed to comply with requirements applicable to government contractors, we may be subject to various actions, including but not limited to fines or penalties, reductions in the value of our government contracts, restrictions on the sale of certain products to the government, or suspension or debarment from government contracting. Failure to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell equivalent commercial products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISK 18: Changes in our effective tax rates as a result of changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets, the geographic mix of earnings, tax examinations or disputes, tax authority rulings, or changes in the tax laws, may adversely affect our financial results.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. We exercise significant judgment in calculating our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain income or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our tax expense and profitability. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income in future periods. Given the global nature of our business, a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including changes in the geographic mix of our profits among jurisdictions with differing statutory income tax rates; sustainability of historical income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business; changes in tax laws applicable to us; expiration, renewal, or application of tax holidays; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; or changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, and deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\nThe amount of income taxes and other taxes we have paid are subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts paid or reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. We are currently under routine examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and we may be subject to additional examinations in the future. The tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and\nthereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nRISK 19: Changes in environmental laws or regulations, the discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, or the failure of a potentially responsible party to perform may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals, gases and other substances used in manufacturing our products that could require us to incur substantial expenses. Environmental laws and regulations allow for the assessment of substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. The discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination at a site which the Company previously operated or currently operates could suddenly subject the Company to costly remediation efforts. We could be affected by changes in environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, those imposed in response to vapor intrusion or climate change concerns and violations by us of such laws and regulations. In addition, we may be impacted by the adequacy of insurance policies, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments, or financial insolvency of other potentially responsible parties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISK 20: Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other applicable anti-corruption legislation, as well as export controls and trade sanctions, could result in fines or criminal penalties.\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to have a reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or applicable non-U.S. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, trade sanctions and regulation, and other laws including but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts, or curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or financial position. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management. Even the allegation or appearance of our employees, agents or business partners acting improperly or illegally could damage our reputation and result in significant expenditures in investigating and responding to such actions.\nRISK 21: We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to product liability.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of products for the markets we serve. In addition, many of the devices we manufacture and sell are critical components designed to be used in harsh environments for long periods of time where the cost of failure is high. Component failures, manufacturing defects, design flaws, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, an end-user of our products. The occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability claims or a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products which could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal of such products from the marketplace and claims regarding costs associated therewith. Product liability claims or product recalls in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have an adverse effect on our reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers for our products.\nRISK 22: Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. For example, the articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. In addition, the articles of incorporation and by-laws, among other things, do not permit action by written consent of the shareholders. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock and us as well as certain restrictions on the voting rights of \"control shares\" of an \"issuing public corporation.\"", "PERMNO": 12570, "SIC": 3561, "TIC": "ITT"}
