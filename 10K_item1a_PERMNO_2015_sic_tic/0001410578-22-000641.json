Risk Factors\nA wide range of factors could materially affect our performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results elsewhere in this report, the following factors, among others, could adversely affect our business, including our results of operations or financial position:\nBusiness and Operational Risks\n\u25cf Risks related to the global outbreak of COVID-19 and other public health crises. The Company faces risks related to pandemics, epidemics, and other public health crises, including the global outbreak of COVID-19, which has reached and disrupted areas in which the Company has operations, suppliers, customers and employees. The COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governments and others in response have resulted in, and may continue to cause, the slowdown of the businesses of certain of the Company\u2019s customers and the closure of certain of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 facilities which in turn has reduced and may continue to reduce demand for some of the Company\u2019s products. Additionally, certain of the Company\u2019s products and parts are manufactured overseas. From time to time during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been delays in receiving products from certain of the Company\u2019s overseas suppliers due to health-related problems at the overseas suppliers or along the supply chain. Should these delays reoccur, the Company would be unable to predict the ultimate duration of such disruptions in supply, whether products or parts from other suppliers will also be delayed, whether such disruptions will become material to the Company and whether, if necessary, the Company will be able to secure such products or parts from alternate suppliers on favorable terms or at all. Moreover, the Company may need to close certain of its facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted the Company\u2019s operations, including by causing many of its employees to work remotely or in shifts designed to minimize exposure. There is also a heightened risk that a significant portion of the Company\u2019s workforce will suffer illness or otherwise not be permitted or be unable to work. The Company cannot predict whether any of these disruptions will continue or whether its operations will experience more significant or frequent disruptions in the future. Any measures the Company implements to mitigate these risks and disruptions may not be successful.\nThe circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve and it is not possible to predict the full nature and extent of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Company expects the continued spread of COVID-19 and reactions by governments and others to continue the economic slowdown in a manner that may remain significant and, therefore, could extend the duration of the period of reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products and disruption of its supply chain. Additionally, deteriorating economic conditions could result in material impairment charges in the value of certain of the Company\u2019s assets. Moreover, circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted global financial markets leading to greater volatility and decreased access to capital. If such conditions continue, the Company\u2019s ability to finance its operations and expenditures may be negatively impacted. Any of the risks set forth in this paragraph and the preceding paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nAdditional public health crises could also emerge in the future, including other pandemics or epidemics. Such public health crises could pose further risks to the Company and could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\n\u25cf Risks associated with sourcing from overseas. We import finished goods and component parts. Any difficulty or inability on the part of manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain in obtaining sufficient financing to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs, their inability to obtain raw materials due to shortages or other factors, or their inability to be able to maintain a sufficient workforce due to a variety of potential factors, may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. Additionally, material increases in raw material commodity prices could further adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Although we believe that there are redundant sources available and maintain multiple sources for most of our products, there may be costs and delays associated with securing such sources and there can be no assurance that such sources would provide the same quality of product at similar prices. Further, substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs\u2019 requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements, bilateral actions or, in some cases unilateral action. Imported products and materials may, from time to time, be subject to tariffs or other trade measures in the U.S. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or our suppliers\u2019 failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm our business. The implementation of additional tariffs, or increased amounts on current tariffs, on items imported by us from China or other countries could increase our costs and could result in lowering our gross margin on products sold and could cause us to have to stop supplying certain customers.\n\u25cf Disruption in the global capital and credit markets. If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, lower consumer spending\nmay result in reduced demand and orders for certain of our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, increased inventories, and lower gross margins. Further, if our customers experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in further reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, inability of customers to timely meet their payment obligations to us, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense; and a severe financial difficulty experienced by our customers may cause them to become insolvent or cease business operations.\n\u25cf Importation issues. Our ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require us to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers, as well as increase our costs. In addition, this could cause us to maintain higher levels of inventory, in order to avoid disruption to customers These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Beginning in early 2021, but magnified during the third and fourth quarter, we encountered severe delays in receiving inventory from our Asian suppliers, in addition to materially increased costs. This has caused intermittent shortages of inventory. The major reasons for these issues include the following: increased price of fuel; shortage of shipping containers; congestion at the ports in Asia and the United States; and shortage of truck drivers in the United States.\n\u25cf Customer concentration. We have several key customers, one of which accounted for approximately 26.1% of our 2021 consolidated revenue and 35.9% of our consolidated accounts receivable on December 31, 2021. Loss of key customers or a material negative change in our relationships with our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.\n\u25cf Unforeseen inventory adjustments or changes in purchasing patterns. We make purchasing decisions based upon a number of factors including an assessment of market needs and preferences, manufacturing lead times and cash flow considerations. To the extent that our assumptions result in inventory levels being too high or too low, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.\n\u25cf Market acceptance of products. There can be no assurance that the market continues its acceptance of the products we introduced in recent years or will accept new products (including the introduction of products into new geographic markets) introduced or scheduled for introduction in 2022. There can also be no assurance that the level of sales generated from these new products or geographic markets relative to our expectations will materialize.\n\u25cf Competition. The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive based on price, quality, availability, post-sale service and brand-name awareness. Several competing companies are well-established manufacturers that compete on a global basis.\n\u25cf Price reductions. Price reductions in response to customer and competitive pressures, as well as price reductions or promotional actions taken in order to drive demand, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.\nIndustry and Economic Risks\n\u25cf Exposure to fluctuations in energy prices. Fluctuations in energy prices, including crude oil and gas prices, could negatively impact the activities of those of our customers involved in extracting, refining, or exploring for crude oil and gas, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on the demand for the products that they purchase from us. Prices for oil and gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of, and demand for, oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control. Worldwide economic, political, and military events, including war (including the military action by Russia in Ukraine), terrorist activity, events in the Middle East and initiatives by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), have contributed, and are likely to continue to contribute, to price and volume volatility. Such volatility could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.\n\u25cf The strength of the retail economy in the United States and abroad. Our business is subject to economic conditions in major markets in which we operate, including recession, inflation, deflation, general weakness in retail and industrial markets, as well as the exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption laws in various countries, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, currency instability, transportation delays or interruptions, sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights, as well as natural disasters. The strength of such markets is a function of many factors beyond our control, including interest rates, employment levels, availability of credit and consumer confidence.\n\u25cf Risks associated with Brexit. It is possible that Brexit will result in our U.K. operations becoming subject to materially different, and potentially conflicting, laws, regulations or tariffs which could require costly new compliance initiatives or changes to legal entity structures or operating practices. The ultimate effects of Brexit are yet to be known.\n\u25cf Adverse changes in currency exchange rates. A majority of our products are manufactured outside the United States, a portion of which are purchased in the local currency. As a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. We believe our most significant foreign currency exposures are the Taiwan dollar (\u201cTWD\u201d) and the Chinese Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d). Purchases from Chinese sources are made in U.S. dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d). However, if the RMB were to be revalued against the dollar, there could be a significant negative impact on the cost of our products. Further, the reporting currency for our Consolidated Financial Statements is the USD. Certain of the Company\u2019s assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the USD. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, those assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues are translated into USD at applicable exchange rates. Increases or decreases in exchange rates between the USD and other currencies affect the USD value of those items, as reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the USD could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf Interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.\nFinancing Risks\n\u25cf Debt and debt service requirements. The amount of our debt from time to time could have important consequences. For example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limit our ability to fund future capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate requirements and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business.\n\u25cf Borrowing and compliance with covenants under our credit facility. Our credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants, and default provisions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our current credit agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders were to accelerate the repayment of borrowings, to the extent we have significant outstanding borrowings at said time, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our asset-based credit facility and our other indebtedness. Also, should there be an event of default, or a need to obtain waivers following an event of default, we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and/or more restrictive covenants in future periods. Further, the amount available for borrowing under our asset-based revolving loan facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is determined by taking into account, among other things, our accounts receivable, inventory and machinery and equipment. Fluctuations in our borrowing base impact our ability to borrow funds pursuant to the revolving loan facility.\n\u25cf Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill. The inability to generate future cash flows sufficient to support the recorded amounts of goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets could result in future impairment charges.\nStrategic Risks\n\u25cf Retention of key personnel. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of our key personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.\n\u25cf Acquisition of businesses. Part of our business strategy is to opportunistically acquire complementary businesses, which involve risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These risks include:\n\u25cf Loss or significant decline in the revenue of customers of the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf Inability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses\u2019 operations;\n\u25cf Inability to coordinate management and integrate and retain employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf Difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems;\n\u25cf Failure to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale or other anticipated benefits, or to maintain operating margins;\n\u25cf Strain on our personnel, systems and resources, and diversion of attention from other priorities;\n\u25cf Incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense;\n\u25cf Unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses; and\n\u25cf Large write-offs or write-downs, or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\n\u25cf Regulatory environment. We cannot anticipate the impact of changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations, and environmental laws, in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens, and a more stringent manner in which they are applied, could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole.\n\u25cf Litigation and insurance. The effects of litigation and product liability exposure, as well as other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our public announcements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position. Further, while we maintain insurance policies to protect against most potential exposures, events may arise against us for which we may not be adequately insured.\n\u25cf The threat of terrorism, military actions and related political instability and economic uncertainty. The threat of potential terrorist attacks on the United States and throughout the world and political instability has created an atmosphere of economic uncertainty in the United States and in foreign markets. Our results may be impacted by the macroeconomic effects of those events. Also, a disruption in our supply chain as a result of terrorist attacks, military action or the threat thereof, may significantly affect our business and its prospects. In addition, such events may also result in heightened domestic security and higher costs for importing and exporting shipments of components and finished goods. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flow or results in any reporting period. On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military action against Ukraine. The impact to Ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries and companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, and actions taken by Russia and certain other countries in response to such sanctions, could also have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n\u25cf Business disruptions or other costs associated with information technology, cyber-attacks, system implementations, data privacy, or catastrophic losses. We rely heavily on computer systems to manage and operate our businesses, and record and process transactions. Computer systems are important to production planning, customer service and order fulfillment among other business-critical processes. Consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance. Despite efforts to prevent such situations, and\nloss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks, our systems may be affected by damage or interruption from, among other causes, fire, natural disasters, power outages, system failures and other information security risks, such as viruses, ransomware attacks and other cyberattacks which have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign private parties and state actors. As discussed further in the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report, our Florida Pneumatic subsidiary incurred a ransomware incident in May 2021.\nComputer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations, such as e-mail, telephone, and other functionality, is concentrated in certain physical locations in which we operate. Additionally, we rely on software applications and enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by third-party vendors, and our business may be adversely affected by service disruptions or security breaches in such third-party systems. Security threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, cloud storage systems, networks, services, and assets, as well as the confidentiality and integrity of some of our customers' data as well as other personal identifiable information maintained by us. If we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information including personal identifiable information due to security breaches, including as a result of human error, technological failures or cybersecurity-related attacks, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations as well as reputational, competitive, or business harm, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We maintain a comprehensive system of preventive and detective controls through our security programs; however, given the rapidly evolving nature and proliferation of cyber threats, our controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks in a timely manner or otherwise prevent unauthorized access to, damage to, or interruption of our systems, operations and data, and we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or employee or vendor malfeasance.\nThe risk factors described above are not intended to be all-inclusive. There can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct. Furthermore, the headings under which the risk factors are arranged are not necessarily exclusive, and all of the risk factors should be read in their entirety. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us. Should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.", "PERMNO": 44230, "SIC": 3540, "TIC": "PFIN"}
