{"cik": "1122063", "company": "FTE Networks, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe following discussion identifies the most significant risks or uncertainties that could (i) materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects or (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. The following information should be read in conjunction with the other portions of this report, including \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Please note that the following discussion is not intended to comprehensively list all risks or uncertainties faced by us. Our operations or actual results could also be similarly impacted by additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, that we currently deem to be immaterial, that may arise in the future or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results, Financing Plans and Indebtedness\nWe have limited capital resources and business operations, and we will need additional funds in order to continue as a viable enterprise. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate those funds from our limited business operations.\nAs previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2019, the Company accepted a foreclosure proposal by the Company\u2019s lenders under that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of July 2, 2019, which proposal included the strict foreclosure by the lenders of all of the Company\u2019s equity interests in Benchmark, which was our primary operating subsidiary, and certain other assets of the Company.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had $95,502,000 in negative working capital and $12,170,000 in cash and cash equivalents. Following the foreclosure, the Company has very limited capital resources and limited business operations, which only include our subsidiaries Jus-Com, Inc. and US Home Rentals LLC.\nAs of the date of this filing, our cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to sustain operations in the near term. We have substantial cash requirements, which consist of payment obligations under existing indebtedness, settlement agreements for indebtedness incurred by former management, payroll and other corporate expenses. Currently, our primary sources of cash have been from short-term borrowings and financings, which prospects have been hampered as a result of the uncertainty as to the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic (which has led to disruption and volatility in the financial and real estate markets). And even though we have already taken measures to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on our business, including negotiating extensions or deferrals on outstanding debt and placing certain employees in impacted markets on furlough, there is no assurance that these efforts will be enough to support our daily operations in the near term without additional financing.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned mitigating strategies, we are considering and actively pursuing various types of financing alternatives, including financings that leverage unencumbered properties in our real estate portfolio and have applied for a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (\u201cEIDL\u201d) pursuant to the recently enacted CARES Act through the U.S. Small Business Association programs. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain PPP or EIDL proceeds as a result of program limitations, our credit profile or other factors or that we will be able to secure additional financing on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. We believe our debt and equity financing prospects will improve once we are current in our Exchange Act filings and we are able to resume trading on a national stock exchange or on an over-the-counter market, although no assurances can be provided in that regard either. And while we believe in the viability of our strategy to increase revenues and raise additional funds, we are unable to predict the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and liquidity, and depending on the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, such impact may be material.\nOur failure to successfully implement our growth plan may adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are prone to all of the risks inherent in growing a business. You should consider the likelihood of our future success to be highly speculative in light of the limited resources, problems, expenses, risks and complications frequently encountered by entities at our current stage of development. As our growth plan is pursued, we may encounter difficulties expanding and improving our operating and financial systems to maintain pace with the increased complexity of the expanded operations and management responsibilities.\nTo address these risks, we must, among other things:\n\u25cf implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy;\n\u25cf continue to develop new products and upgrade our existing products;\n\u25cf respond to industry and competitive developments;\n\u25cf attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel; and\n\u25cf obtain equity or debt financing on satisfactory terms and in timely fashion in amounts adequate to implement our business plan and meet our obligations.\nWe may not be successful in addressing these risks and if we do not, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nDebt financing agreements we enter into may contain a number of restrictive covenants which will limit our ability to finance future operations, acquisitions or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.\nIf the Company has the need for additional liquidity through debt financing, any related credit arrangements and indentures may contain a number of significant covenants that could impose operating and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictions could affect, and in many respects could limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability and the ability of some of our subsidiaries to:\n\u25cf incur additional indebtedness\u037e\n\u25cf create liens\u037e\n\u25cf pay dividends and make other distributions in respect of our equity securities\u037e\n\u25cf redeem or repurchase our equity securities\u037e\n\u25cf distribute excess cash flow from foreign to domestic subsidiaries\u037e\n\u25cf make investments or other restricted payments\u037e\n\u25cf sell assets\u037e and\n\u25cf effect mergers or consolidations.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market or economic conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans, and could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nIf we are required to repay our outstanding notes, we would need to raise additional funds. Failure to repay our notes could subject us to legal action, including, but not limited to, judgements being entered against us.\nWe entered into settlement agreements with certain holders of convertible notes, whose notes were deemed to have been issued without the requisite corporate authorization following the findings of our independent investigation announced on June 13, 2019 (See Item 1 Business, Recent Development \u201cInternal Investigation\u201d). Of the noteholders with whom we were unable to reach settlement terms, six filed purported confessions of judgment. We have since entered into settlement agreements with all holders of judgments previously entered against us, which require us to make monthly payments in accordance with respective payout schedules. To date, we have requested and received several forbearances/deferrals on certain of the monthly payments owed in connection with these settlements and may have to request additional forbearances and/or deferrals in the future. As of the date of this filing, there is an aggregate balance owing of approximately $4,471,000 to these noteholders, exclusive of the convertible redeemable note in the amount of $1,800,000 to GS Capital Partners, LLC (\u201cGS Capital\u201d) issued on March 10, 2020. If we were unable to repay these notes when required, the noteholders could commence legal action against us to recover the amounts due, including possibly filing confessions of judgment. Any such action would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we issued $9,750,000 of promissory notes as part of the of the purchase consideration for the Vision Transaction, which notes were payable in full on March 31, 2020 (the \u201cVision Notes\u201d). As of the date of this filing, we have made partial payments against the Vision Notes but we were unable to repay the Vision Notes by their stated maturity date. We are currently negotiating forbearance agreements and are actively pursuing multiple potential sources of additional debt and equity capital to fund repayment of the Vision Notes. There is, however, no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining forbearance agreements or securing suitable financing. If we are not able to obtain forbearance agreements and/or do not succeed in raising additional capital in a timely fashion, the Vision noteholders may seek to enforce their rights under the Vision Notes through the judicial process, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur insiders and affiliated parties beneficially own a significant portion of the aggregate voting power of our capital stock.\nAs of the date of hereof, our executive officers, directors, their affiliated parties and holders of 10% or more of our common stock beneficially own approximately 41.1% of our common stock. As a result, our officers, directors, their affiliated parties and holders of 10% or more of our common stock will have a controlling interest and the ability to:\n\u25cf elect or defeat the election of our directors;\n\u25cf amend or prevent amendment of our certificate of incorporation, as amended, or bylaws;\n\u25cf effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u25cf affect the outcome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for vote.\nAffiliated party stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempt to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing any gains from our common stock. In addition, any sale of a significant amount of our common stock held by our directors, executive officers, and affiliated parties, or the possibility of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market for our common stock is limited and you may not be able to sell your common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The NYSE American has suspended the trading of our common stock and commenced delisting proceedings of our common stock. We are appealing the NYSE American delisting proceedings, but there can be no assurance our common stock will resume trading or that our common stock will continue to be listed. If we are unsuccessful in our appeal of the NYSE American hearing panel\u2019s decision to delist our common stock, or if our appeal is successful and thereafter we are unable to meet the NYSE American continued listing requirements, the NYSE American may delist our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on us and the liquidity and market price of our stock. Even if we remain listed and trading of our common stock resumes, we expect the market for purchases and sales of our common stock will be limited and therefore the sale of a relatively small number of shares could cause the price to fall sharply. Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares quickly without significantly depressing the value of our common stock. Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our common stock, sales of our common stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to fluctuations.\nIf our revenues do not grow or grow more slowly than we anticipate, or, if operating or capital expenditures exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly, or if some other event adversely affects us, the market price of our common stock could decline. Fluctuations in our stock price may be influenced by, among other things, general economic and market conditions, conditions or trends in our industry, changes in the market valuations of other telecommunications companies, announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or other strategic initiatives, and trading volumes. Many of these factors are beyond our control but may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our operating performance. Moreover, if the stock market in general experiences a loss in investor confidence or otherwise fails, the market price of our common stock could fall for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations and financial condition. The market price of our common stock also might decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts.\nStockholders who hold unregistered shares of our common stock may be subject to resale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144, due to the fact that we are deemed to be a former \u201cshell company.\u201d\nPursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act (\u201cRule 144\u201d), a \u201cshell company\u201d is defined as a company that has no or nominal operations and either (i) no or nominal assets, (ii) assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents or (iii) assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. While we do not believe that we are currently a \u201cshell company,\u201d we were previously a \u201cshell company\u201d and are deemed to be a former \u201cshell company\u201d pursuant to Rule 144, and as such, sales of our securities pursuant to Rule 144 may not be able to be made unless we continue to be subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and have filed all of our required periodic reports for at least the previous one year period prior to any sale pursuant to Rule 144. As a result, it may be harder for us to fund our operations and pay our consultants with our securities instead of cash. Our status as a former \u201cshell company\u201d could prevent us from raising additional funds, engaging consultants, and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our appeal of the NYSE American decision to delist our common stock, or if our appeal is successful and we are thereafter unable to meet the NYSE American continued listing standards, our common stock may be delisted from the NYSE American equities market, which would likely cause the liquidity and market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. The NYSE American has suspended the trading of our common stock and is engaged in delisting proceedings of our common stock. We are appealing the NYSE American hearing panel\u2019s determination to delist our common stock, but there can be no assurance that our appeal will be successful, that our common stock will resume trading or that our common stock will continue to be listed. If we are unsuccessful in our appeal of the NYSE American hearing panel\u2019s decision to delist our common stock, or if our appeal is successful and thereafter if we cannot meet the NYSE American continued listing requirements, the NYSE American may delist our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on us and the liquidity and market price of our stock.\nOur business has been and may continue to be affected by worldwide macroeconomic factors, which include uncertainties in the credit and capital markets. External factors that affect our stock price, such as liquidity requirements of our investors, as well as our performance, could impact our market capitalization, revenue and operating results, which, in turn, could affect our of the NYSE American hearing panel\u2019s decision to delist our common stock or, if our appeal is successful, our ability to meet the NYSE American\u2019s listing standards. The NYSE American has the ability to suspend trading in our common stock or remove our common stock from listing on the NYSE American if in the opinion of the exchange: (a) the financial condition and/or operating results of the Company appear to be unsatisfactory; or (b) it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of our common stock has become so reduced as to make further dealings on the exchange inadvisable; or (c) we have sold or otherwise disposed of our principal operating assets, or have ceased to be an operating company; or (d) we have failed to comply with our listing agreements with the exchange (which include that we receive additional listing approval from the exchange prior to us issuing any shares of common stock, something we have inadvertently failed to comply with in the past); or (e) any other event shall occur or any condition shall exist which makes further dealings on the exchange unwarranted.\nCommencing in March 2019, we received a series of letters from the NYSE American concerning the failure to comply with various continued listing requirements. On December 17, 2019, we received a letter from the NYSE American stating that it had determined to commence proceedings to delist the Company\u2019s common stock from the Exchange, and our common stock was suspended from trading on NYSE American at market close on the same date. Additionally, we were out of compliance with the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing requirements under the timely filing criteria outlined in Section 1007 of the NYSE American Listed Company Guide as a result of our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, in the past we have been out of compliance with the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing standards when, on each of October 9, 2019 and May 30, 2019, certain members of the Board of Directors resigned and we received notification from the NYSE American that (1) the Company\u2019s Audit Committee was no longer compliant with Section 803B(2)(c) and Section 803B(2)(a)(iii) of the Company Guide as it was no longer composed of two independent members and did not have a financially sophisticated audit committee member and (2) and the Company\u2019s Compensation Committee was no longer compliant with the requirements set forth in Section 805(a) of the Company Guide. On May 30, 2019, we also received notification that the Company\u2019s Nominating Committee was no longer compliant with the requirements set forth in Section 804 of the Company Guide. In each instance, in order to regain compliance with these listing requirements, the Board appointed additional members and made appropriate committee appointments.\nA delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock and reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing. In addition, delisting from the NYSE American might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business. Additionally, if we were delisted from the NYSE American and we are not able to list our common stock on another national exchange we will no longer be eligible to use Form S-3 registration statements and will instead be required to file a Form S-1 registration statement for any primary or secondary offerings of our common stock, which would delay our ability to raise funds in the future, may limit the type of offerings of common stock we could undertake, and would increase the expenses of any offering, as, among other things, registration statements on Form S-1 are subject to SEC review and comments whereas take downs pursuant to a previously filed Form S-3 are not. Because of the lateness of certain of our filings with the SEC, we are not currently eligible to use Form S-3, but if we file our periodic reports with the SEC in a timely manner for 12 months and otherwise satisfy the eligibility requirements, we will be eligible to use Form S-3 for public offerings of our common stock.\nIf shares of our common stock cease to be listed on a national exchange they may become subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the SEC and the trading market in our securities may become limited, which will make transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock.\nIf shares of our common stock cease to be listed on the NYSE American or another national exchange, they may be subject to regulation as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. That rule establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that is no longer trading on a national exchange and has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.\nIf shares of our common stock cease to be listed on a national exchange our securities will not be eligible for federal preemption rights and be subject to state \u201cblue sky\u201d laws which may affect our capabilities of raising capital.\nEach state has its own securities laws, often called \u201cblue sky\u201d laws, which (i) limit sales of securities to a state\u2019s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (ii) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or the transaction must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker must be registered in that state. We do not know whether securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. If our securities cease to be listed on the national exchange, a determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as the market-makers for our common stock. Registering or qualifying shares with states can be time consuming. Compliance and regulatory costs may vary from state to state and may adversely affect future financings and our ability to raise capital.\nIf our common stock is delisted from a national exchange some institutional investors may not be allowed to purchase our shares and may be required to liquidate their current positions in our stock which could negatively affect the price and volatility of our shares.\nInstitutional investors may be restricted by their investment policies from investing in shares of companies that are not listed on a national exchange and may be required to liquidate their positions if our securities are delisted from a national exchange. Liquidations, should they occur, may increase volatility and cause wide fluctuations and further declines in the prices of our securities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our shares of common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our share price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and any return on investment may be limited to potential future appreciation on the value of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including without limitation, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements or other debt instruments that we may be a party to at the time. To the extent we do not pay dividends, our shares of common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if and to the extent our stock price appreciates, which may never occur. In addition, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize their investment, and if the price of our common stock does not appreciate, then there will be no return on investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Business\nThe current pandemic of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could materially and adversely impact or disrupt our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance.\nSince being reported in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread globally, including to every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and another pandemic in the future could have, repercussions across regional and global economies and financial markets. The outbreak of COVID-19 in many countries has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and, as cases of COVID-19 have continued to be identified in additional countries, many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel.\nCertain states and cities, including where we own rental homes, have also reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, \u201cshelter in place\u201d rules, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry directly or indirectly. We expect that a significant number of our tenants will suffer economic dislocation, such as through job furloughs or job loss, which will adversely impact their ability to pay rent to the Company. Some of our tenants have already requested rent deferral or rent abatement during this pandemic. Many experts predict that the outbreak will trigger, or even has already triggered, a period of global economic slowdown or a global recession, which would further adversely impact the ability of our tenants to pay rent to the Company. The COVID-19 pandemic, or a future pandemic, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to successfully operate and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to, among other factors:\n\u25cf a complete or partial closure of, or other operational issues at, our corporate headquarters, rental and associated property management business from government or tenant action;\n\u25cf the reduced economic activity severely impacts our tenants\u2019 livelihoods, financial condition and liquidity and may cause them to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations;\n\u25cf difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address existing and anticipated liabilities on a timely basis;\n\u25cf a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability or desire to grow our portfolio of properties;\n\u25cf a deterioration in our ability to operate in affected areas or delays in the supply of products or services to us from vendors that are needed for our efficient operations could adversely affect our operations; and\n\u25cf the potential negative impact on the health of our personnel, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted, could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption; and\n\u25cf the inability of our business to secure financing or grants through the U.S. Small Business Association programs, including the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, the Paycheck Protection Program, or other similar offerings, each as a result of program limitations, our credit profile, or other factors; and\n\u25cf the inability of state or federal jurisdictions to mandate coverage business interruption insurance policies which contain pandemic exclusions or our inability to otherwise secure recoveries from such insurance coverages should they become available.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our operations and those of our tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The inability of our tenants rent to us, and early terminations by our tenants of their leases, could reduce our cash flows, which could have a material adverse impact on our performance, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance. The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the full adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance.\nOur results of operations will likely be diminished as a result of the foreclosure on the equity of Benchmark Builders, Inc., down-sizing of Jus-Com and divestiture of CrossLayer as well as our reliance on other operating subsidiaries. We may not be able to effectively manage the transition of our business.\nAs discussed above, our lenders previously foreclosed on the equity in Benchmark, previously our primary operating subsidiary, as well as other assets. Additionally, the Company restructured and down-sized the Jus-Com businesses in 2019, completed the acquisition of entities that collectively hold a real estate asset portfolio consisting of 3,184 rental homes located across the United States (the \u201cVision Properties\u201d), and completed the divestiture of CrossLayer in January 2020. Due to the Benchmark foreclosure, the down-sizing of the Jus-Com businesses and the divestiture of CrossLayer, the Company is now reliant on the businesses of our remaining operating subsidiaries, primarily the U.S. Home Rental properties.\nMoreover, whereas our Historical Businesses operated in the construction management and general contracting industry and telecommunications industry, our primary current business operates in the single-family residential property industry. As we are transitioning our business to focus primarily on single-family residential properties, this business model transition may lead to fluctuations in revenue that will make it more difficult to accurately project our operating results or plan for future growth. If we are unable to effectively manage these changes, our growth and ability to achieve long-term projections may be negatively impacted, and our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur integration of the operations of Vision Properties may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of these acquisitions by the Company may not be realized.\nDuring 2019, pursuant to the Vision Purchase Agreement, as amended, we completed the acquisition of the Vision Properties. The acquisition of the Vision Properties represented the Company\u2019s pivot to owning and managing a portfolio of single-family residential properties. The success of the acquisition, including anticipated benefits, will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses within the Company\u2019s projected timeframe in a manner that permits growth opportunities. A number of factors could affect the Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine its business with acquired businesses, including the following:\n\u25cf the potential for unexpected costs, delays and challenges that may arise in integrating the Vision Properties into the Company\u2019s business;\n\u25cf unexpected obstacles to the Company\u2019s ability to realize the expected cost savings and synergies from the acquisition;\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s ability to retain key employees and maintain relationships;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources during integration efforts;\n\u25cf challenges related to operating a new business and in new states; and\n\u25cf discovery following the acquisition of previously unknown liabilities associated with the Vision Properties.\nIf the Company encounters significant difficulties in the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in the timeframe projected by the Company could result in increased costs and decreased revenues. This could have a dilutive effect on the Company\u2019s earnings per share. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate the business it acquired, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nLiabilities and obligations assumed in connection with our acquisition of Vision Properties may result in a material adverse effect to our business and financial condition.\nUncertainty of Common Stock Value. Our common stock, par value $0.001 (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d) was suspended from trading on the NYSE American exchange effective December 17, 2019 and continues to be suspended from trading as of the date of the filing of the Form 10-K. As a result, there is currently no public market for our Common Stock and investors in our Common Stock have limited liquidity. The aggregate value of the Common Stock Consideration issuable pursuant to the Amended Purchase Agreement was determined through negotiations between the Company and the Sellers based on a number of factors, including the estimated book value of the Company after giving effect to the Transaction. Due to its limited liquidity and lack of a current active trading market, the fair value of our Common Stock is uncertain and may not be equal to the agreed-upon valuation of the Common Stock Consideration. Although the Company is appealing its suspension from trading on the NYSE American exchange, there can be no assurance that its appeal will be successful.\nRisk of Default under Entities\u2019 Indebtedness. The entities that we acquired in the Vision Properties transaction, which own all of the properties that were subject to the acquisition, are subject to substantial indebtedness (the \u201cEntities\u2019 Indebtedness\u201d), as described in \u201cItem 1. Business - Recent Developments.\u201d The Entities\u2019 Indebtedness is subject to certain conditions and covenants, including the requirement that the Entities obtain the consent of the lender before taking certain actions. Any failure to comply with the conditions and covenants in the financing agreements governing the Entities\u2019 Indebtedness that is not consented to or waived by the lender or otherwise cured could lead to a termination of such debt facilities, acceleration of all amounts due under such debt facilities, or other actions by the lender. The consent of the lender may have been required with respect to the Transaction, and although the Sellers have engaged in negotiations with the lender seeking to obtain such consent prior to the Closing, such consent has not been obtained as of the date of filing of this Form 10-K. While the Company intends to continue to seek to obtain the consent from the lender regarding the Transaction, we cannot guarantee that such consent will be received.\nExisting Default under Purchase Price Promissory Notes. The $9,750,000 of promissory notes issued as part of the purchase consideration in the Vision Properties acquisition were payable in full on March 31, 2020, and while partial payments have been made against the notes, we were unable to pay the notes in full by the maturity date. We are currently negotiating forbearance agreements and are actively pursuing multiple potential sources of additional debt and equity capital to fund repayment of the amounts due pursuant to the Notes and our ongoing operating expenses. We may not be successful in obtaining forbearance agreements or securing suitable financing in the time period required. If we are not able to obtain forbearance agreements and/or do not succeed in raising additional capital in a timely fashion, our resources will not be sufficient to fund the repayment of the notes. The noteholders may seek to enforce their rights under the promissory notes through the judicial process, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be harmed by security breaches or other significant disruptions or failures of networks, information technology infrastructure or related systems owned or installed by us.\nWe are materially reliant upon our networks, information technology infrastructure and related technology systems (including our billing and provisioning systems) to manage our operations and affairs. We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach or significant disruption of our information technology infrastructure and related systems. Moreover, in connection with processing and storing sensitive and confidential data on our networks, we face a risk that a security breach or disruption could result in unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 or their customers\u2019 proprietary information.\nWe strive to maintain the security and integrity of information and systems under our control and maintain contingency plans in the event of security breaches or other system disruptions. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that our security efforts and measures will prevent unauthorized access to our systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, or other forms of cyber-attacks or similar events. These threats may derive from human error, hardware or software vulnerabilities, aging equipment or accidental technological failure. These threats may also stem from fraud, malice or sabotage on the part of employees, third parties or foreign nations, including attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce our employees or customers to disclose or grant access to our data or our customers\u2019 data, potentially including information subject to stringent domestic and foreign data protection laws governing personally identifiable information, protected health information or other similar types of sensitive data. These threats may also arise from failure or breaches of systems owned, operated or controlled by other unaffiliated operators to the extent we rely on such other systems to deliver services to our customers. Each of these risks could further intensify to the extent we maintain information in digital form stored on servers connected to the Internet.\nAdditional risks to our network, infrastructure and related systems include, among others:\n\u25cf capacity or system configuration limitations, including those resulting from changes in usage patterns, the introduction of new technologies or products, or incompatibilities between newer and older systems;\n\u25cf theft or failure of our equipment;\n\u25cf software or hardware obsolescence, defects or malfunctions;\n\u25cf power losses or power surges;\n\u25cf physical damage, whether caused by fire, flood, adverse weather conditions, terrorism, sabotage, vandalism or otherwise;\n\u25cf deficiencies in our processes or controls;\n\u25cf our inability to hire and retain personnel with the requisite skills to adequately design, install, maintain or improve our products;\n\u25cf programming, processing and other human error; and\n\u25cf inadequate building maintenance by third-party landlords or other service failures of our third-party vendors.\nDue to these factors, from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we experience disruptions in our service and could experience more significant disruptions in the future.\nDisruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described networks and systems could:\n\u25cf disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems;\n\u25cf result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive, classified or otherwise valuable information of ours;\n\u25cf require us to notify customers, regulatory agencies or the public of data breaches;\n\u25cf subject us to claims for damages, fines, penalties, termination or other remedies under our customer contracts or service standards set by regulators, which in certain cases could exceed our insurance coverage;\n\u25cf result in a loss of business, damage our reputation among our customers and the public generally; or\n\u25cf require significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the resulting damages or to change our systems, including expenses to repair systems, add new personnel or develop additional protective systems.\nAny or all of the foregoing developments could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers\u2019 businesses.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions have in the past resulted and may in the future result in lower spending among our customers and contribute to decreased sales. Further, our business may be adversely affected by factors such as downturns in economic activity in specific geographic areas or in the telecommunications industry; social, political or labor conditions; trade restrictions such as tariffs or changes imposed on international trade agreements; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, or regulations. These factors are beyond our control, but may result in decreases in spending among customers and softening demand for our products and services. Declines in demand for our products and services will adversely affect our sales. Further, challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, our cash flow may be negatively impacted and our allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\nThe Company may experience interruptions to its business operations due to events beyond its control, and insurance may not cover the full extent of damages.\nA catastrophic event beyond our control, such as a natural disaster, health pandemic, cyber-attack, adverse weather event or act of terrorism, that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business systems or operations could harm its ability to conduct normal business operations and its operating results.\nWhile we maintain business continuity plans that are intended to allow us to continue operations or mitigate the effects of events that could disrupt our business, we cannot provide assurances that our plans would fully protect us from all such events. In addition, insurance maintained by us to protect against property damage, loss of business and other related consequences resulting from catastrophic events is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our damages or damages to others in the event of a catastrophe. In addition, insurance related to these types of risks may not be available now or, if available, may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates.\nDue to our size, we depend on key personnel and other skilled employees.\nOur employees are key to the growth and success of our business and our continued success depends to a large extent on our ability to recruit, train, and retain skilled employees, particularly executive management and technical employees. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s ability to retain skilled workforce and its success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining whether the Company will be successful in the future. The Company faces competition for qualified individuals and may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals. The Company\u2019s failure to do so could have an adverse effect on its ability to implement the business plan.\nFuture litigation may impair our reputation or lead us to incur significant costs, and the costs of such litigation may exceed our insurance coverage.\nWe are currently party to several lawsuits and may become party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, third party contract manufacturers, intellectual property, product recalls, product liability, false or deceptive advertising, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. Negative publicity resulting from allegations made in lawsuits or claims asserted against us, whether or not valid, may adversely affect our reputation. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain general and excess liability, cyber security, workers\u2019 compensation and medical insurance, all in amounts consistent with industry practice and as part of our overall risk management strategy. Further, our policies are held with financially stable coverage providers, often in a layered or quota share arrangement which reduces the likelihood of an interruption or impact to operations. Although we have various insurance programs in place, the potential liabilities associated with potential litigation matters, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to pending or future claims or lawsuits. If we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, or if coverage is denied, we may be required to make material payments to settle litigation or satisfy any judgment. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are operating in an emerging industry, and the long-term viability of our investment strategy on an institutional scale is unproven.\nLarge-scale institutional investment in single-family residential (\u201cSFR\u201d) homes for rent is a relatively recent phenomenon that has emerged out of the mortgage and housing crisis that began in late 2007. Prior to that time, SFR homes were generally not viewed as viable assets for investment on a large scale by institutional investors. Consequently, the long-term viability of the SFR property investment strategy on an institutional scale has not yet been proven. As a participant in this emerging industry, we are subject to the risk that SFR properties may not prove to be a viable long-term investment strategy on an institutional scale for a permanent capital vehicle. If it turns out that this investment strategy is not a viable one, we would be materially and adversely affected, and we may not be able to sustain the growth of our assets and results from operations that we seek.\nOur failure to effectively perform property management functions or to effectively manage our portfolio and operations could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe have direct responsibility for the management of the properties in our SFR portfolio, including, without limitation, renovations, maintenance and certain matters related to leasing, such as marketing and selection of tenants. If our internal property manager is unable to effectively perform property management services at the level and/or the cost that we expect or if we fail to allocate sufficient resources to meet our property management needs, it would adversely affect our performance. In addition, we will be responsible for ensuring the compliance of our internal property manager with governmental laws, regulations and covenants that are applicable to our homes, our tenants and our prospective tenants, including, without limitation, permitting, licensing and zoning requirements and tenant relief laws, such as laws regulating evictions, rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates.\nOur ability to perform the property management services will be affected by various factors, including, among other things, our ability to maintain sufficient personnel and retain key personnel and the number of our SFR properties that we manage. No assurance can be made that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or in integrating any new personnel into our organization.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality and maintain other necessary internal controls. Our inability to effectively perform the property management services on the properties managed by us, or to effectively manage our portfolio and operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial results and share price.\nWe may incur significant costs in renovating our properties or turning vacant properties, and we may underestimate the costs or amount of time necessary to complete restorations or unit turns.\nWhile a substantial portion of the SFR properties we have acquired to date meet our rental specifications at the time of acquisition, properties frequently require additional renovations prior to renting. Beyond customary repairs, we may undertake improvements designed to optimize the overall property appeal and increase the value of the property. Though we endeavor to conduct property inspections and due diligence prior to acquiring new SFR portfolios, we expect that nearly all of our rental properties will require some level of renovation immediately upon their acquisition or in the future following expiration of a lease or otherwise. We may acquire properties that we plan to extensively renovate and restore. In addition, in order to reposition properties in the rental market, we will be required to make ongoing capital improvements and may need to perform significant renovations and repairs from time to time. Consequently, we are exposed to the risks inherent in property renovation, including potential cost overruns, increases in labor and materials costs, delays by contractors in completing work, delays in the timing of receiving necessary work permits and certificates of occupancy and poor workmanship. If our assumptions regarding the cost or timing of renovations across our properties prove to be materially inaccurate, it may be more costly or take significantly more time than anticipated to develop and grow our SFR portfolio, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn addition, we anticipate a minimum level of effort will be required to prepare a newly vacant property to be made ready for occupancy by a new tenant, and we are exposed to risks of cost overruns, increases in costs of materials or labor, delays in the completion of work and other factors. If we are unable to perform unit turns efficiently or in a timely manner, we would experience decreased revenue, increased expenses or both.\nThe availability of portfolios of single-family residential properties for purchase on favorable terms may decline as market conditions change, our industry matures and/or additional purchasers for such portfolios emerge, and the prices for such portfolios may increase, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in supply of SFR property portfolios available for sale. Because we operate in an emerging industry, market conditions may be volatile, and the prices at which portfolios of SFR properties can be acquired may increase from time to time, or permanently, due to new market participants seeking such portfolios, a decrease in the supply of desirable portfolios or other adverse changes in the geographic areas that we may target from time to time. For these reasons, the supply of SFR properties that we may acquire may decline over time, which could materially and adversely affect us and our growth prospects.\nPortfolios of properties that we have acquired or may acquire may include properties that do not fit our investment criteria, and divestiture of such properties may be costly or time consuming or both, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, portfolios of SFR properties, many of which are, or will be, subject to existing leases. We may be subject to a variety of risks, including risks relating to the condition of the properties, the credit quality and employment stability of the tenants and compliance with applicable laws, among others. In addition, financial and other information provided to us regarding such portfolios during our due diligence may be inaccurate, and we may not be able to obtain relief under contractual remedies, if any. If we conclude that certain properties acquired as part of a portfolio do not fit our investment criteria, we may decide to sell such properties and may be required to renovate the properties prior to sale, to hold the properties for an extended marketing period and/or sell the property at an unfavorable price, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nCompetition in identifying and acquiring residential rental assets could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe face competition from various sources for investment opportunities, including REITs, hedge funds, private equity funds, partnerships, developers and others. Some third-party competitors have substantially greater financial resources and access to capital than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can. Competition from these companies may reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities available to us or increase the bargaining power of asset owners seeking to sell, which would increase the prices of assets. If such events occur, our ability to implement our business strategy could be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect us. Given the existing competition, complexity of the market and requisite time needed to make such investments, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in acquiring investments that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Furthermore, there is no assurance that such investments, once acquired, will perform as expected.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by risks affecting the single-family rental properties in which our investments may be concentrated at any given time as well as from unfavorable changes in the related geographic regions.\nOur assets are not subject to any geographic diversification requirements or concentration limitations, and, as a result, circumstances or events that impact a geographic region in which we have a significant concentration of properties, including a downturn in regional economic conditions or natural disasters, could materially and adversely affect us. Entities that sell residential rental portfolios may group the portfolios by location or other metrics that could result in a concentration of our portfolio by geography, SFR property characteristics and/or tenant demographics. Such concentration could increase the risk of loss to us if the particular concentration in our portfolio is subject to greater risks or undergoing adverse developments. In addition, adverse conditions in the areas where our properties or tenants are located (including business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, oversupply, reduced demand and other factors) may have an adverse effect on the value of our investments. A material decline in the demand for single-family housing or rentals in the areas where we own assets may materially and adversely affect us. Lack of diversification can increase the correlation of non-performance and foreclosure risks among our investments.\nShort-term leases of residential property expose us more quickly to the effects of declining market rents.\nThe majority of our leases to tenants of SFR properties will be for a term of one year. As these leases permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, we anticipate our rental revenues will be affected by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. Short-term leases may result in high turnover, resulting in additional cost to renovate and maintain the property and lower occupancy levels. Because we have a limited operating history, our tenant turnover rate and related cost estimates may be less accurate than if we had more operating data upon which to base these estimates.\nWe may be unable to secure funds for property restoration or other capital improvements, which could limit our ability to attract, retain or replace tenants.\nWhen we acquire or otherwise take title to single-family properties or when tenants fail to renew their leases or otherwise vacate their space, we may be required to expend funds for property restoration and leasing commissions in order to lease the property. If we have not established reserves or set aside sufficient funds for such expenditures, we may have to obtain financing from other sources, as to which no assurance can be given. We may also have future financing needs for other capital improvements to restore our properties. If we need to secure financing for capital improvements in the future but are unable to secure such financing on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable or unwilling to make capital improvements or may choose to defer such improvements. If this happens, our properties may suffer from a greater risk of obsolescence or decreased marketability, a decline in value or decreased cash flow as a result of fewer potential tenants being attracted to the property or existing tenants not renewing their leases. If we do not have access to sufficient funding in the future, we may not be able to make necessary capital improvements to our properties, and our properties\u2019 ability to generate revenue may be significantly impaired.\nOur revenue and expenses are not directly correlated, and, because a large percentage of our costs and expenses are fixed and some variable expenses may not decrease over time, we may not be able to adapt our cost structure to offset any declines in our revenue.\nMany of the expenses associated with our business, such as acquisition costs, restoration and maintenance costs, HOA fees, personal and real property taxes, insurance, compensation and other general expenses are fixed and would not necessarily decrease proportionally with any decrease in revenue. Our assets also will likely require a significant amount of ongoing capital expenditure. Our expenses, including capital expenditures, will be affected by, among other things, any inflationary increases, and cost increases may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. Certain expenses, such as HOA fees, taxes, insurance and maintenance costs are recurring in nature and may not decrease on a per-unit basis as our portfolio grows through additional property acquisitions. By contrast, our revenue is affected by many factors beyond our control, such as the availability and price of alternative rental housing and economic conditions in our markets. As a result, we may not be able to fully, or even partially, offset any increase in our expenses with a corresponding increase in our revenues. In addition, state and local regulations may require us to maintain our properties, even if the cost of maintenance is greater than the potential benefit.\nCompetition could limit our ability to lease single-family rental properties or increase or maintain rents.\nOur SFR properties compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents, including rental apartments, condominiums and other single- family homes available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. Our competitors\u2019 properties may be of better quality, in a more desirable location or have leasing terms more favorable than we can provide. In addition, our ability to compete and generate favorable returns depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, the financial condition and liquidity of current and prospective renters, availability and cost of capital, taxes and governmental regulations. Given significant competition, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring or managing SFR properties that generate favorable returns.\nIf rents in our markets do not increase sufficiently to keep pace with potential rising costs of operations, our operating results and cash available for distribution will decline.\nThe success of our business model will substantially depend on conditions in the SFR property market in our geographic markets. Our asset acquisitions are premised on assumptions about, among other things, occupancy and rent levels. If those assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our operating results and cash available for distribution will be lower than expected, potentially materially. Rental rates and occupancy levels have benefited in recent periods from macroeconomic trends affecting the U.S. economy and residential real estate and mortgage markets in particular, including a tightening of credit and increases in interest rates that has made it more difficult to finance a home purchase, combined with efforts by consumers generally to reduce their exposure to credit. A decrease in rental rates would have a material adverse effect on the performance of our SFR portfolio or could cause a default of our obligations under one or more financing agreements, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would therefore be materially harmed.\nIf the current trend favoring renting rather than homeownership reverses, the single-family rental market could decline.\nThe SFR market is currently significantly larger than in historical periods. We do not expect the favorable trends in the SFR market to continue indefinitely. Eventually, continued strengthening of the U.S. economy and job growth, together with the large supply of foreclosed SFR properties, the current availability of low residential mortgage rates and government sponsored programs promoting home ownership, may contribute to a stabilization or reversal of the current trend that favors renting rather than homeownership. In addition, we expect that as investors increasingly seek to capitalize on opportunities to purchase undervalued housing properties and convert them to productive uses, the supply of SFR properties will decrease and the competition for tenants will intensify. A softening of the rental property market in our markets would adversely affect our operating results and cash available for distribution, potentially materially.\nSuboptimal tenant underwriting and defaults by our tenants may materially and adversely affect us.\nOur success depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified tenants for our properties. This depends, in turn, upon our ability to screen applicants, identify good tenants and avoid tenants who may default. We may make mistakes in our selection of tenants, and we may rent to tenants whose default on our leases or failure to comply with the terms of the lease or HOA regulations could materially and adversely affect us. For example, tenants may default on payment of rent; make unreasonable and repeated demands for service or improvements; make unsupported or unjustified complaints to regulatory or political authorities; make use of our properties for illegal purposes; damage or make unauthorized structural changes to our properties that may not be fully covered by security deposits; refuse to leave the property when the lease is terminated; engage in domestic violence or similar disturbances; disturb nearby residents with noise, trash, odors or eyesores; fail to comply with HOA regulations; sub-let to less desirable individuals in violation of our leases or permit unauthorized persons to live with them. The process of evicting a defaulting tenant from a family residence can be adversarial, protracted and costly. Furthermore, some tenants facing eviction may damage or destroy the property. Damage to our properties may significantly delay re-leasing after eviction, necessitate expensive repairs, reduce the rental revenue generated by the property or impair its value. In addition, we will incur turnover costs associated with re-leasing the properties, such as marketing expenses and brokerage commissions, and will not collect revenue while the property is vacant. Although we will attempt to work with tenants to prevent such damage or destruction, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in all or most cases. Such tenants will not only cause us not to achieve our financial objectives for the properties in which they live, but may subject us to liability and may damage our reputation with our other tenants and in the communities where we do business.\nA significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to our SFR properties on terms we considered commercially reasonable. However, many of the policies covering casualty losses are subject to substantial deductibles and exclusions, and we will be self-insured up to the amount of the deductibles and exclusions. For example, we may not always be fully insured against losses arising from floods, windstorms, fires, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism or civil unrest because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it economically impractical. If an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur, we could lose our capital invested in a property or group of properties as well as the anticipated future revenues from affected SFR properties or groups of properties. Further, inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also prevent us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a property after it has been damaged or destroyed.\nIn the event that we incur a casualty loss that is not fully covered by insurance, the value of our assets will be reduced by the amount of any such uninsured loss, and we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property. Further, if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur, we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party. A significant uninsured property or liability loss could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, cash flows and ability to make distributions on our common stock.\nWe rely on information supplied by prospective tenants in managing our business.\nWe rely on information supplied to us by prospective tenants in their rental applications as part of our due diligence process to make leasing decisions, and we cannot be certain that this information is accurate. In particular, we rely on information submitted by prospective tenants regarding household income, tenure at current job, number of children and size of household. Moreover, these applications are submitted to us at the time we evaluate a prospective tenant, and we do not require tenants to provide us with updated information during the terms of their leases, notwithstanding the fact that this information can, and frequently does, change over time. Even though this information is not updated, we will use it to evaluate the overall average credit characteristics of our portfolio over time. If tenant-supplied information is inaccurate or our tenants\u2019 creditworthiness declines over time, we may make poor leasing decisions, and our portfolio may contain more credit risk than we believe.\nOur single-family residential properties are not liquid assets, which could limit our ability to vary our portfolio or to realize the value at which such assets are carried if we are required to dispose of them.\nOur SFR properties are not liquid assets, which could limit our ability to vary our portfolio or to realize the value at which such assets are carried if we are required to dispose of them. Our inability to sell individual or portfolios of SFR properties on acceptable terms and/or in accordance with our anticipated timing could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nChanges in global economic and capital market conditions, including periods of generally deteriorating occupancy and real estate industry fundamentals, may materially and adversely affect us.\nThere are risks to the ownership of real estate and real estate related assets, including decreases in residential property values, changes in global, national, regional or local economic, demographic and real estate market conditions as well as other factors particular to the locations of our investments. A prolonged recession and a slow recovery could materially and adversely affect us as a result of, among other items, the following:\n\u25cf joblessness or unemployment rates that adversely affect the local economy;\n\u25cf an oversupply of or a reduced demand for SFR properties for rent;\n\u25cf a decline in employment or lack of employment growth;\n\u25cf the inability or unwillingness of residents to pay rent increases or fulfill their lease obligations;\n\u25cf a decline in rental rate, which may be accentuated since we expect to generally have rent terms of one year;\n\u25cf rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing that could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs;\n\u25cf changes in interest rates and availability and terms of debt financing; and\n\u25cf economic conditions that could cause an increase in our operating expenses such as increases in property taxes, utilities and routine maintenance.\nThese conditions could also adversely impact the financial condition and liquidity of the renters that will occupy our real estate properties and, as a result, their ability to pay rent to us.\nResidential properties that are subject to eviction are subject to risks of theft, vandalism or other damage that could impair their value.\nWhen a residential property is subject to an eviction, it is possible that the tenant may cease to maintain the property adequately or that the property may be abandoned by the tenant and become susceptible to theft or vandalism. Lack of maintenance, theft and vandalism can substantially impair the value of the property. To the extent we initiate eviction proceedings, some of our properties could be impaired.\nContingent or unknown liabilities associated with respect to our prior acquisitions of portfolios of properties could adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and operating results.\nAssets and entities that we have acquired in connection with prior SFR portfolio or operating entity acquisitions may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse against the sellers. Unknown or contingent liabilities might include liabilities for or with respect to liens attached to properties; unpaid real estate tax, utilities or HOA charges for which a subsequent owner remains liable; clean-up or remediation of environmental conditions or code violations; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with the acquired entities; or tax liabilities. Purchases of single-family properties in portfolio purchases typically involve limited representations or warranties with respect to the properties and may allow us limited or no recourse against the sellers. Such properties also often have unpaid tax, utility and HOA liabilities for which we may be obligated but fail to anticipate. As a result, the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with prior SFR property or entity acquisitions may exceed our expectations, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, such prior SFR property acquisitions may be subject to covenants, conditions or restrictions that restrict the use or ownership of such properties, including prohibitions on leasing. We may not have discovered such restrictions during the acquisition process, and such restrictions may adversely affect our ability to operate such properties as we intend.\nThe costs and amount of time necessary to secure possession and control of certain properties may exceed our assumptions, which would delay our receipt of revenue from, and return on, the property.\nA majority of the SFR properties we have acquired have had an existing tenant at the time of acquisition. However, certain SFR properties require us to secure possession. In certain circumstances, we may have to evict occupants who are in unlawful possession before we can secure possession and control of the property. The holdover occupants may be the former owners or tenants of a property, or they may be squatters or others who are illegally in possession. Securing control and possession from these occupants can be both costly and time consuming. If these costs and delays exceed our expectations, our financial performance may suffer because of the increased expenses incurred or the unexpected delays in turning the properties into revenue-producing rental properties.\nEminent domain could lead to material losses on our investments.\nIt is possible that governmental authorities may exercise eminent domain to acquire land on which our properties are built in order to build roads or other infrastructure. Any such exercise of eminent domain would allow us to recover only the fair value of the affected properties, which we believe may be interpreted to be substantially less than the actual value of the property. Several cities are also exploring proposals to use eminent domain to acquire residential loans to assist borrowers to remain in their homes, potentially reducing the supply of single-family properties for sale in our markets. Any of these events can cause a material loss to us.\nWe likely will incur costs due to litigation, including but not limited to, class actions, tenant rights claims and consumer demands.\nThere are numerous tenants\u2019 rights and consumer rights organizations throughout the country. As we grow in scale, we may attract attention from some of these organizations and become a target of legal demands or litigation. Many such consumer organizations have become more active and better funded in connection with mortgage foreclosure-related issues and displaced home ownership. Some of these organizations may shift their litigation, lobbying, fundraising and grass roots organizing activities to focus on landlord-tenant issues as more entities engage in the SFR property market. Additional actions that may be targeted at us include eviction proceedings and other landlord-tenant disputes, challenges to title and ownership rights (including actions brought by prior owners alleging wrongful foreclosure by their lender or servicer) and issues with local housing officials arising from the condition or maintenance of an SFR property. While we intend to conduct our rental business lawfully and in compliance with applicable landlord-tenant and consumer laws, such organizations might work in conjunction with trial and pro bono lawyers in one state or multiple states to attempt to bring claims against us on a class action basis for damages or injunctive relief. We cannot anticipate what form such legal actions might take or what remedies they may seek. Any of such claims may result in a finding of liability that may materially and adversely affect us.\nAdditionally, these organizations may lobby local county and municipal attorneys or state attorneys general to pursue enforcement or litigation against us or may lobby state and local legislatures to pass new laws and regulations to constrain our business operations. If they are successful in any such endeavors, they could directly limit and constrain our business operations and impose on us significant litigation expenses, including settlements to avoid continued litigation or judgments for damages or injunctions. Any of the above-described occurrences may materially and adversely affect us.", "PERMNO": 17182, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "FTNW"}
