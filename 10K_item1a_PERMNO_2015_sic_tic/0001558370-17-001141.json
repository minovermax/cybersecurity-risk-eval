{"cik": "861361", "company": "B/E AEROSPACE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Any of these risks could also cause the market value of our common stock to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or currently believe are not material may also adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSee \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nWe are directly dependent upon the conditions in the airline and business jet industries, which are, among other things, correlated to global economic conditions and an economic downturn could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are directly dependent upon the airline and business jet industries, which are sensitive to changes in global economic conditions. The airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and global economies. Stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the United States or in other geographic regions, as we are currently experiencing, may have a material adverse effect on our business. Past periods of unfavorable economic conditions caused a reduction in spending for both leisure and business travel, resulting in the airline industry parking aircraft, delaying new aircraft purchases and deliveries, deferring retrofit programs and depleting existing inventories. The business jet industry is also severely impacted by both a weaker economy and by declining corporate profits. According to IATA, the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009, combined with the high fuel prices experienced during most of 2009, contributed to the worldwide airline industry\u2019s loss of approximately $4.6 billion in 2009. Concerns over the tightening of the corporate credit markets, inflation, energy costs and other factors may continue to contribute to volatility in the global financial markets and may create further uncertainties for global economic conditions in the future. Furthermore, the environment in which the airline and business jet industries operate could continue to be affected by adverse foreign exchange impacts, fluctuating fuel prices, consolidation in the industry, changes in regulation, terrorism, safety, environmental, health concerns and labor issues. Many of these factors have, and could continue to have, a negative impact on air travel, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business is also affected by risks that uniquely impact the airline and business jet industries. For instance, potential terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security breaches, or fear of such events, even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry have, and could continue to have, a negative effect on the airline industry and as a result, our business as well. The global airline industry lost a total of approximately $52.8 billion during the period from 2001 to 2009 as a result of the decline in traffic and airfares caused by, among other things, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks, the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, increases in fuel costs and heightened competition from low-cost carriers. During this period, a significant number of airlines worldwide declared bankruptcy or ceased operations. Any of these factors could potentially impact the airline and business jet industries in the future, and subsequently, materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe operate in cyclical industries and a continued economic downturn could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in cyclical industries. During periods of economic expansion, when capital spending normally increases, we generally benefit from greater demand for our products. During periods of economic contraction, when capital spending normally decreases, we generally are adversely affected by declining demand for our products and services. The impact of declining demand can be exacerbated by oversupply\nbuilt during periods of expansion as there is a lag in suppliers\u2019 reactions to contraction. Industry conditions are impacted by numerous factors over which we have no control, including political, regulatory, economic and military conditions, environmental concerns, weather conditions and fuel pricing. Any prolonged cyclical downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe airline industry is heavily regulated and failure to comply with applicable laws could reduce our sales, or require us to incur additional costs to achieve compliance, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation cabin interior products and licenses component repair stations within the United States. Comparable agencies, such as the EASA, the CAAC and the JCAB, regulate these matters in other countries. If we fail to obtain a required license for one of our products or services or lose a license previously granted, the sale of the subject product or service would be prohibited by law until such license is obtained, reinstated or renewed. In addition, designing new products to meet existing regulatory requirements and retrofitting installed products to comply with new regulatory requirements can be both expensive and time consuming.\nFrom time to time, these regulatory agencies propose new regulations. These new regulations generally cause an increase in costs to comply with these regulations. For example, the FAA dynamic testing requirements originally established in 1988 under 14 CFR 25.562 are currently required for certain new generation aircraft types. The enactment of 14 CFR 121.311(j) requires dynamic testing of all seats installed in all new aircraft produced after October 27, 2009. The EASA aligned its regulations to match FAA rule 25.562 in 2013. To the extent the FAA or the EASA implement rule changes in the future, we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance.\nThe airline industry is subject to extensive health, safety and environmental regulations, any violation of which could subject us to significant liabilities and penalties.\nWe are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health, safety and environmental quality standards, and may be subject to liabilities or penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or waste for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or at facilities we may acquire.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThere are risks inherent in international operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nWhile the majority of our operations are based domestically, we have significant manufacturing operations based internationally with facilities in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and the Philippines. In addition, we sell our products to airlines all over the world. Our customers are located primarily in North America, Europe, Asia, the Pacific Rim, South America and the Middle East. As a result, 61%, 65% and 67% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were to customers located outside the United States. Volatile international economic, political and market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, we have a number of subsidiaries in foreign countries (primarily in Europe), which have sales outside the United States. As a result, we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations as a portion of\nour net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Approximately 41% of our sales during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 came from our foreign operations. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies affect the dollar value of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, with these fluctuations being included in a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity. At December 31, 2016, we reported a cumulative foreign currency translation and other adjustments of approximately $166.4 million in stockholders\u2019 equity primarily as a result of foreign currency adjustments, and we may incur additional adjustments in future periods. In addition, operating results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for purposes of our statement of operations at average monthly exchange rates. Moreover, to the extent that our revenues are not denominated in the same currency as our expenses, our net earnings could be materially adversely affected. For example, a portion of labor, material and overhead costs for goods produced in our production facilities in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and the Philippines are incurred in British pounds, Euros or Philippine pesos, but the related sales revenues are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or other currencies could result in material fluctuations in foreign currency translation amounts or the U.S. dollar value of transactions and, as a result, our net earnings could be materially adversely affected.\nHistorically we have not engaged in hedging transactions. However, we may engage in hedging transactions in the future to manage or reduce our foreign exchange risk. Our attempts to manage our foreign currency exchange risk may not be successful and, as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur foreign operations could also be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other market barriers and political, economic and social instability in the countries where we operate or sell our products and offer our services. The impact of any such events that may occur in the future could subject us to additional costs or loss of sales, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Current events, including the recent United States presidential election, the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to exit the European Union, and tax reform proposals, create a level of uncertainty for our operations, including the potential for increased tariffs and other negative influences on U.S. trade relations with other countries. Our foreign operations are increasingly complex due to the possibility of renegotiated trade deals, revised international tax law treaties, and changes to the United States corporate tax code. Changes in U.S. political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies involving foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the countries where we currently operate and sell products, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be materially adversely affected by fluctuating fuel prices.\nFluctuations in the global supply of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production, transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability and price volatility and cost of jet fuel. In the event of a natural disaster, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns, political disruptions, outbreaks or escalation of hostilities or other conflicts or significant disruptions in oil production or delivery in oil-producing areas or elsewhere, there could be reductions in the production or importation of crude oil and significant increases in the cost of jet fuel. If there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or significant increases in its cost, commercial airlines will face increased operating costs. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, airlines are often unable to pass on future increases in fuel prices to customers by increasing fares. As a result, an increase in jet fuel could result in a decrease in net income from either lower margins or, if airlines increase ticket fares, less revenue from reduced airline travel. Decreases in airline profitability could decrease the demand for new commercial aircraft, resulting in delays of or reductions in deliveries of commercial aircraft equipped with our cabin interior products and, as a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. On the other hand, significant decreases in oil and fuel prices could have\nan adverse impact on certain of our customers that generate, benefit from or are dependent on the production of oil or other fuels.\nWe incur risks associated with new programs.\nNew programs with new technologies and requirements typically carry risks associated with design changes, development of new production tools, increased capital and funding commitments, ability to meet customer specifications, delivery schedules and unique contractual requirements, supplier performance, ability of the customer to meet its contractual obligations to us, and our ability to accurately estimate costs associated with such programs. In addition, any new program may not generate sufficient demand or may experience technological problems or significant delays in regulatory or other certification or manufacturing and delivery schedules. If we were unable to perform our obligations under new programs to the customer\u2019s satisfaction, if we were unable to manufacture products at our estimated costs, or if a new program in which we had made a significant investment was terminated or experienced weak demand, certification or other delays or technological problems, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to effectively and efficiently manage our inventories as we expand our business, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have substantially expanded the size, scope and nature of our business through acquisitions and organic means, resulting in an increase in the breadth of our product offerings and an expansion of our business geographically. Business expansion places increasing demands on us to increase the inventories that we carry. We must anticipate demand well out into the future in order to service our extensive customer base. The inability to effectively and efficiently manage our inventories to meet current and future needs of our customers, which may vary widely from what is originally forecast due to a number of factors beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have a significant backlog that may be deferred or may not be entirely realized.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $3.5 billion of booked backlog. Given the nature of our industry and customers, there is a risk that orders forming part of our backlog may be cancelled or deferred due to economic conditions or fluctuations in our customers\u2019 business needs, purchasing budgets or inventory management practices. We also could be impacted if entry into service for any new aircraft platform is delayed or if the rate of delivery is lower than expected or deferred as a result of production or other manufacturing difficulties.\nA significant portion of both our booked backlog and awarded but unbooked backlog includes programs with Boeing and Airbus, which makes us particularly vulnerable to their businesses and continued production of various airplane models. For example, at December 31, 2008, while no major retrofit programs were cancelled, several large retrofit programs that were scheduled for delivery in 2009 were deferred until 2010 and 2011, which negatively impacted our revenues and profits for 2009. Failure to realize sales from our existing or future backlog could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe failure of our suppliers to perform to our requirements could negatively impact our results of operations, including our profit margins.\nWe depend on manufacturing firms to support our operations through the timely supply of products. Our suppliers may experience capacity constraints that may result in their inability to supply us with products in a timely fashion, with adequate quantities or at a desired price. Factors affecting the manufacturing sector can include labor disputes, general economic issues, and changes in raw material and energy costs. Natural disasters such as earthquakes or hurricanes, as well as political instability and terrorist activities, may\nnegatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of our suppliers as well. These factors could lead to increased prices for our inventory, curtailment of supplies and the unfavorable allocation of product by our suppliers, which could reduce our revenues and profit margins and harm our customer relations. Significant disruptions in our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have grown, and may continue to grow, at a rapid pace. Our inability to properly manage or support the growth may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend to continue to grow our business both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products and services. Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our management team and our operational, administrative and financial resources. We may not be able to grow effectively or manage our growth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks associated with the sale of our products and services to the U.S. Government, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a supplier directly to the defense industry and as a subcontractor to suppliers of the U.S. Government, we face risks that are specific to doing business with the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government has the ability to unilaterally suspend the award of new contracts to us in the event of any violations of procurement laws, or reviews of the same. It could also reduce the value of our existing contracts as well as audit our costs and fees. Many of our U.S. Government contracts may be terminated for convenience by the government. Termination-for-convenience provisions typically provide that we would recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on the work that we completed prior to termination. In such an event, we would not earn the revenue that we would have originally anticipated from such a terminated contract.\nGovernment reviews can be costly and time consuming, and could divert our management resources away from running our business. As a result of such reviews, we could be required to provide a refund to the U.S. Government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost, or the U.S. Government could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our products. These actions could have a negative effect on our management efficiency and could reduce our revenues and results of operations. Additionally, as a U.S. Government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal laws governing suppliers to the U.S. Government, including potential application of the False Claims Act.\nOur total assets include substantial intangible assets. The write-off of a significant portion of intangible assets would negatively affect our reported financial results.\nOur total assets reflect substantial intangible assets. At December 31, 2016, goodwill and identifiable intangibles together represented approximately 30% of our total assets. Intangible assets consist principally of goodwill and other identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives. If the carrying value of the tested asset exceeds its estimated fair value, impairment is deemed to have occurred. In this event, the amount is written down to fair value. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, this would result in a charge to operating earnings. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized identified intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, which could be material. We performed our annual testing of impairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. There were no impairment charges recorded in 2014, 2015 or 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the balances of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets were $798.7 million and $213.0 million, respectively.\nIf we make acquisitions, they may be less successful than we expect, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have made many acquisitions in the past. We may also consider future acquisitions, some of which could be material to us. We explore and conduct discussions with many third parties regarding possible acquisitions. Our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to effectively identify attractive businesses, access financing sources on acceptable terms, negotiate favorable transaction terms and successfully consummate and integrate any businesses we acquire, achieve cost efficiencies and manage these businesses as part of our Company.\nOur acquisition activities may involve unanticipated delays, costs and other problems. If we encounter unanticipated problems with one of our acquisitions, our senior management may be required to divert attention away from other aspects of our business. Additionally, we may fail to consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures, after incurring expenses and devoting substantial resources, including management time, to such transactions. Acquisitions also pose the risk that we may be exposed to successor liability relating to actions by an acquired company and its management before the acquisition. The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition, and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies, may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities. Additionally, depending upon the acquisition opportunities available, we also may need to raise additional funds through the capital markets or arrange for additional bank financing in order to consummate such acquisitions or to fund capital expenditures necessary to integrate the acquired business. We also may not be able to raise the substantial capital required for acquisitions and integrations on satisfactory terms, if at all. If any of the above situations were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur operations rely on an extensive network of information technology resources and a failure to maintain, upgrade and protect such systems from cyber or other security threats could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation technology plays a crucial role in all of our operations. To remain competitive, our hardware, software and related services must interact with our suppliers and customers efficiently, record and process our financial transactions accurately, and obtain the data and information to enable the analysis of trends and plans and the execution of our strategies.\nThe failure or unavailability of our information technology systems could directly impact our ability to interact with our customers and provide them with products and services when needed. Cybersecurity threats, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks to our information technology infrastructure and attacks to the information technology infrastructure of third parties in attempts to gain unauthorized access to confidential, classified or otherwise proprietary information of us and/or our employees, customers and other third parties. Despite our efforts to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Such failure to properly supply or service our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, our customer relationships could be damaged well beyond the period of the downtime of our information technology systems.\nWe may be unable to retain personnel who are key to our operations.\nOur success, among other things, is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified senior management and other key personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and\ncompensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. The inability to hire, develop and retain these key employees may adversely affect our business.\nWe compete with a number of established companies, some of which have significantly greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we do, and we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies.\nWe compete with numerous established companies. Some of these companies have significantly greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we do. Our ability to be a successful competitor depends on our success in causing our products and the new products we may develop to be selected for installation in new aircraft, including next-generation aircraft, and in avoiding product obsolescence. It will also depend on our ability to remain the supplier of retrofit and refurbishment products and spare parts on the commercial fleets on which our products are currently in service. Developing and maintaining a competitive advantage may require continued investment in product development, engineering, supply-chain management and sales and marketing, and we may not have enough resources to make such investments, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreased leverage could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe may incur additional debt under our current revolving credit facility or through new borrowings to finance our operations, capital deployment plans, or for future growth, including funding acquisitions. A high degree of leverage could have important consequences to us. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged; and\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry.\nWe have significant financial and operating restrictions in our debt instruments that may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe credit agreement governing our senior secured bank credit facilities (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) contains numerous financial, operating and/or negative covenants that may limit our ability to incur additional or repay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to make certain payments and investments, including dividend payments, to repurchase shares, to engage in transactions with affiliates, to engage in sale/leaseback transactions, to guarantee indebtedness and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. Agreements governing future indebtedness could also contain significant financial and operating restrictions. A failure to comply with the obligations contained in any current or future agreement governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under our current or any future credit facility, or any future indenture or agreements governing our debt securities that we may issue, which could permit acceleration of the related debt and acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions. We may not have, or may not be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make any required accelerated payments.\nAdditional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various international jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Furthermore, changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our accounting for tax assets and liabilities and related items. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. In addition to ongoing examinations, there could be additional examinations launched in the future by governmental tax authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing examinations could be expanded. The final determinations of these tax examinations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional examinations, proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, prior acquisitions and divestitures, taxes, anti-bribery and corruption laws, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Additionally, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for damages, personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we designed, manufactured or serviced. Accordingly, we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Furthermore, negative publicity about an accident, catastrophe or incident involving aircraft containing our critical components could damage our reputation for quality products regardless of fault and cause a material adverse effect on our ability to retain and attract customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways, and such laws and their related interpretations may change from time to time. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to such laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights.\nWhile we maintain insurance for certain risks, including product liability claims, our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. We also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at a cost acceptable to us. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend.\nWe rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the United States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products we sell and otherwise use in our operations. Any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our research and development. Litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. Additionally, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may\nbe unable to protect our intellectual property adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nThird parties may also claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Even if we believe that such intellectual property claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against, and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction preventing us from importing, marketing or selling certain of our products. Such outcomes could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nProvisions in our charter documents may discourage potential acquisitions of our Company, even those which the holders of a majority of our common stock may favor.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated by-laws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an unsolicited acquisition of us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. Our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated by-laws:\n\u00b7\nclassify the Board of Directors into three classes, with directors of each class serving for a staggered three-year period;\n\u00b7\nprovide that directors may be removed only for cause and only upon the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of such directors;\n\u00b7\nrequire at least two-thirds of the voting power of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to alter, amend or repeal the provisions relating to the classified board and removal of directors described above;\n\u00b7\npermit only existing members of the Board of Directors to fill vacancies and newly created directorships on the board;\n\u00b7\nprovide that only the existing members of the Board of Directors may change the number of directors on the Board of Directors;\n\u00b7\nrestrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u00b7\ncontain advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals.\nThere can be no assurance that we will pay cash dividends.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy that contemplates the payment of cash dividends. Whether, when and in what amounts we in fact pay such dividends remains entirely at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our future earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions, operating conditions, contractual restrictions, including those restrictions in our Credit Agreement and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. All of these factors and their evaluation by our Board of Directors, as well as the dividend policy itself, are subject to change. Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will pay dividends in any particular amounts or at all. If we do not pay cash dividends in accordance with the policy, this could have a negative effect on our share price.\nIf the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders could incur substantial losses of any investment in our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases, and decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock. For example from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, the sale price of our common stock fluctuated between $60.45 and $36.38. The price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to:\n\u00b7\nour quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our business;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the market\u2019s perception of our business;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the businesses, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors or customers;\n\u00b7\nchanges in airline industry or business jet industry conditions;\n\u00b7\ndelays in new aircraft certification, production or order rates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in general market or economic conditions; and/or\n\u00b7\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nRisks Relating to our Spin-Off of KLX\nThere could be significant liability if the distribution of KLX common stock to our stockholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.\nWe received an opinion from tax counsel to the effect that, among other things, the separation and distribution of KLX qualified as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations, undertakings and covenants from us and KLX regarding the past and future conduct of ours and KLX\u2019s respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, undertakings or covenants is incorrect or not satisfied, the opinion of tax counsel may no longer be valid.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the receipt by us of the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) could determine on audit that the separation and distribution of KLX is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, undertakings or covenants is not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or KLX. If the distribution of KLX common stock is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the KLX common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders that received KLX common stock\nin the distribution generally would be treated as having received a taxable dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the KLX common stock. The resulting U.S. federal income tax liabilities of us and such stockholders could be significant.\nUnder the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement between KLX and us, KLX generally is required to indemnify us against (i) any taxes imposed on us with respect to the distribution of KLX common stock to the extent that such taxes result from certain events with respect to KLX, and (ii) a portion, based on the relative trading prices of our common stock and KLX common stock during the period shortly after the distribution, of any taxes imposed on us with respect to the distribution of KLX common stock if the distribution fails to qualify as a tax-free transaction for reasons other than those for which KLX or us would be responsible for pursuant to the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement.\nA court could require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to KLX under the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement, from and after the Spin-Off, the Company and KLX are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which it owns and operates following the consummation of the Spin-Off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any obligations that are not allocated to us under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, a court could disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to KLX (including, for example, environmental liabilities), particularly if KLX were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the allocated obligations.\nCertain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their current positions with KLX or their ownership of KLX equity.\nCertain of our directors are directors or officers of KLX and thus have professional relationships with KLX\u2019s executive officers and directors. Three of our directors, including our Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, serve on the Board of Directors of KLX. Our Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of KLX and as its Chief Executive Officer. In addition, several of our directors have a financial interest in KLX as a result of their ownership of KLX stock and restricted stock. These relationships and financial interests may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors face decisions that could have different implications for KLX than for us.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Acquisition of the Company by Rockwell Collins\nThe summary of the Merger Agreement and the descriptions of the terms and conditions therein do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the Merger could have material adverse effects on the Company.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, receipt of the Rockwell Collins Stockholder Approval, receipt of Company Stockholder Approval and receipt of certain other regulatory approvals, each of which make the completion and timing of the completion of the Merger uncertain. Also, either Rockwell Collins or the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been consummated by 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on October 21, 2017, except that this right to terminate the Merger Agreement will not be available to any party whose failure to perform or comply with any of its obligations under the Merger Agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the closing of the Merger to have occurred on or before that date.\nIf the Merger is not completed, the Company\u2019s ongoing business may be materially adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, the Company will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline;\n\u00b7\nthe Company could owe substantial termination fees to Rockwell Collins under certain circumstances;\n\u00b7\nif the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Company\u2019s Board of Directors seeks another business combination, the Company\u2019s stockholders cannot be certain that the Company will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Rockwell Collins has agreed to in the Merger Agreement;\n\u00b7\ntime and resources, financial and other, committed by the Company\u2019s management to matters relating to the Merger could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities for the Company;\n\u00b7\nthe Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from its customers or employees; and\n\u00b7\nthe Company may be required to pay costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees, whether or not the Merger is completed.\nIn addition, if the Merger is not completed, the Company could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against the Company to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. The materialization of any of these risks could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ongoing business.\nSimilarly, delays in the completion of the Merger could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger, could discourage a potential competing acquiror of the Company from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in specified circumstances, could require the Company to pay substantial termination fees to Rockwell Collins.\nThe Merger Agreement contains certain provisions that restrict the Company\u2019s ability to, among other things, initiate, seek, solicit, knowingly encourage, knowingly induce or take any other action reasonably expected to lead to, or engage in negotiations or discussions relating to, or approve or recommend, any third-party acquisition proposal. Further, even if the Rockwell Collins board of directors withdraws or qualifies its recommendation with respect to the issuance of Rockwell Collins common stock forming part of the Merger consideration or if the Company\u2019s Board of Directors withdraws or qualifies its recommendation with respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement, in each case as permitted by the Merger Agreement, unless the Merger Agreement has also been terminated in accordance with its terms, Rockwell Collins or the Company, as the case may be, will still be required to submit each of the share issuance proposal and the merger proposal, as applicable, to a vote at their special meeting of stockholders. In addition, following receipt by the Company of any third-party acquisition proposal that constitutes a \u201csuperior proposal,\u201d the Rockwell Collins will have an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement before the Company\u2019s Board of Directors may withdraw or qualify its recommendation with respect to the share issuance proposal or the merger proposal, as applicable, in favor of such superior proposal.\nIn some circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company could be required to pay a termination fee of $200 million to Rockwell Collins.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of the Company or pursuing an alternative transaction from considering or proposing such a transaction, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the per share cash or market value proposed to be received or realized in the Merger. In particular, a termination fee, if applicable, may be substantial, and could result in a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner proposing to pay a lower price to the Company stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay absent such a fee.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Company determines to seek another business combination, the Company may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger.\nThe Merger is subject to the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods and the receipt of approvals, consents or clearances from regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the combined company or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the Merger.\nBefore the Merger may be completed, any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act relating to the consummation of the Merger must have expired or been terminated, and any authorization or consent from a governmental authority required to be obtained with respect to the Merger in certain other applicable foreign antitrust laws must have been obtained. In deciding whether to grant the required regulatory authorization or consent, the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the Merger on competition within their relevant jurisdiction. The terms and conditions of the authorizations and consents that are granted may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company\u2019s business. Under the Merger Agreement, Rockwell Collins and the Company have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such authorizations and consents and therefore may be required to comply with conditions or limitations imposed by governmental authorities, except that Rockwell Collins will not be required to agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or impair its ability to own or operate any of its or the Company\u2019s assets or properties if such action would require the divestiture or holding separate of any assets of Rockwell Collins or the Company or any of their subsidiaries representing more than $175 million of annual revenue generated in the 2015 calendar year.\nIn addition, regulators may impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions in connection with their authorization of or consent to the Merger, and such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions may delay completion of the Merger or impose additional material costs on or materially limit the revenues of the combined company following the completion of the Merger or may hinder the anticipated benefits of the Merger. There can be no assurance that regulators will choose not to impose such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions, and, if imposed, such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions may delay or lead to the abandonment of the Merger.\nThe value of the stock portion of the Merger consideration is subject to changes based on fluctuations in the value of Rockwell Collins common stock, and the Company stockholders may receive stock consideration with a value that, at the time received, is less than $27.90 per share of the Company common stock.\nThe market value of Rockwell Collins common stock will fluctuate during the period before the date of the Rockwell Collins and the Company special meetings, during the 20 trading day period that the exchange ratio will be based upon, and the time between the last day of the 20 trading day period and the time the Company\u2019s stockholders receive the Merger consideration in the form of Rockwell Collins common stock, as well as thereafter.\nUpon completion of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Company common stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger consideration, which is equal to $34.10 in cash, without interest, and a fraction of a share of Rockwell Collins common stock having a value equal to $27.90, subject to\nadjustment based upon a two-way collar mechanism as described below. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than or equal to $77.41 and less than or equal to $89.97, the exchange ratio will be equal to the quotient of (i) $27.90 divided by (ii) the Rockwell Collins stock price, which, in each case, will result in the stock consideration having a value equal to $27.90. If Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than $89.97, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3101 and the value of the stock consideration will be more than $27.90, and if the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3604 and the value of the stock consideration will be less than $27.90. Accordingly, the actual number of shares and the value of Rockwell Collins common stock delivered to the Company\u2019s stockholders will depend on the Rockwell Collins stock price, and the value of the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock delivered for each such share of Company common stock may be greater than, less than or equal to $27.90.\nIt is impossible to accurately predict the market price of Rockwell Collins common stock at the effective time or during the period over which the Rockwell Collins stock price is calculated and therefore impossible to accurately predict the number or value of the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that the Company\u2019s stockholders will receive in the Merger. You should obtain current market quotations for shares of Rockwell Collins common stock.\nEach party is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed Merger is pending, which could adversely affect each party's business and operations.\nIn connection with the pendency of the Merger, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom Rockwell Collins or the Company has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with Rockwell Collins or the Company, as the case may be, as a result of the Merger, which could negatively affect Rockwell Collins\u2019 or the Company\u2019s respective revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of Rockwell Collins common stock or Company common stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the Merger which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to enter into or amend contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures. Such limitations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operations prior to the completion of the Merger.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, Rockwell Collins is subject to a more limited set of restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the Merger which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to amend its organizational documents, pay dividends and issue shares of Rockwell Collins common stock. Such limitations could adversely affect Rockwell Collins\u2019 business and operations prior to the completion of the Merger.\nEach of the risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the Merger.\nUncertainties associated with the Merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company.\nRockwell Collins and the Company are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans. The combined company's success after the completion of the Merger will depend in part upon the ability of Rockwell Collins and the Company to retain certain key management personnel and employees. Prior to completion of the Merger, current and prospective employees of Rockwell Collins and the Company may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the completion of the Merger, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of Rockwell Collins and the Company to attract or retain key management and other key\npersonnel. In addition, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees of Rockwell Collins and the Company to the same extent that Rockwell Collins and the Company have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees.\nLitigation filed against Rockwell Collins, the Company, Merger Sub and the members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors could prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger or result in the payment of damages following completion of the Merger.\nIn connection with the Merger, three putative class action lawsuits seeking to enjoin the Merger, recover damages, and other relief, were filed by three different purported stockholders of the Company. Two of the lawsuits assert claims against the Company and the members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and initially sought to expedite proceedings in advance of the stockholder vote; plaintiffs have withdrawn the motion to expedite as moot. The outcome of these lawsuits is uncertain. The third lawsuit asserted claims against the Company, the members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, Rockwell Collins and Merger Sub; plaintiff in that case moved to enjoin the Merger but has since withdrawn the motion and dismissed the case with prejudice as to the named plaintiff.\nOne of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that no governmental authority has issued or entered any order after the date of the Merger Agreement having the effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and these lawsuits seek an order enjoining consummation of the Merger. If the cases are not resolved, these lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Rockwell Collins and the Company, including, but not limited to, costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Merger is completed may adversely affect Rockwell Collins\u2019 and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompletion of the Merger will trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which the Company is a party, which may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe completion of the Merger will trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which the Company is a party. If Rockwell Collins and the Company are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if Rockwell Collins and the Company are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to the Company or the combined company. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Rockwell Collins common stock to be received by the Company\u2019s stockholders upon completion of the Merger will have different rights from shares of Company common stock.\nUpon completion of the Merger, the Company stockholders will no longer be stockholders of the Company but will instead become stockholders of Rockwell Collins and their rights as Rockwell Collins stockholders will be governed by the terms of Rockwell Collins\u2019 certificate of incorporation and by-laws. The terms of Rockwell Collins\u2019 certificate of incorporation and by-laws are in some respects materially different than the terms of the Company's certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which currently govern the rights of the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nThe Merger could result in significant liability to Rockwell Collins and the Company if the Merger causes the KLX spin-off to fail to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment.\nAt the time of the KLX spin-off, the Company received an opinion of Shearman & Sterling to the effect that, subject to the limitations and assumptions set forth therein, the KLX spin-off that occurred in December 2014 will qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment, which generally means a transaction tax-free to the Company and its stockholders under the U.S. federal income tax rules for spin-offs in Section 355 of the Code and related provisions. If, however, the KLX spin-off were to fail to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment, the Company would be subject to tax on substantial gain as if the Company had sold the KLX common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value at the time of the KLX spin-off. In addition, if the KLX spin-off failed to qualify for tax-free treatment, each Company stockholder at the time of the KLX spin-off would be treated as if it had received a distribution from the Company in an amount equal to the fair market value of the KLX common stock that they received; this distribution generally would be taxed as a dividend to the extent of the stockholder's pro rata share of the Company's current and accumulated earnings and profits at the time of the KLX spin-off and then treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's basis in Company common stock and finally as capital gain from the sale or exchange of Company common stock.\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, the KLX spin-off would fail to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment if the KLX spin-off was determined to have been used by the Company principally as a device for the distribution of earnings and profits by, for example, facilitating a taxable sale of the stock of the Company or KLX through a planned or intended change-in-control transaction identified prior to the KLX spin-off rather than principally to achieve one or more valid corporate business purposes. Furthermore, even if the KLX spin-off were otherwise to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, it would be taxable to the Company (but not to the Company's stockholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code, if the KLX spin-off was determined to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, stock representing a 50% or greater interest in the Company or KLX.\nIf it is determined that the KLX spin-off fails to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment as a result of the Merger (for example, if the Merger is viewed as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the KLX spin-off or the KLX spin-off is found to have been used principally as a device for the distribution of earnings and profits), or because of the failure of the KLX spin-off to initially qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment, the Company could incur significant tax liabilities. Because the Company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins following the consummation of the Merger, any such tax liabilities of the Company could also adversely affect Rockwell Collins. If the KLX spin-off fails to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment, this may also result in adverse tax consequences to stockholders of the Company at the time of the KLX spin-off because they would be taxed on the distribution of KLX stock as described above.\nIn connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, Rockwell Collins and the Company each received an opinion from their respective counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, which is referred to as Skadden, and Shearman & Sterling to the effect that the Merger will not cause the KLX spin-off to fail to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment. The Merger is conditioned upon receipt by Rockwell Collins and the Company of tax opinions to the same effect at the time of the consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that if either party's tax counsel indicates it is unwilling or unable to deliver a tax opinion at the time of the consummation of the Merger, the tax opinion condition of either Rockwell Collins or the Company may be satisfied by such party's receipt of similar tax opinions from both the other party's tax counsel and the additional tax counsel.\nThe tax opinions received by Rockwell Collins and the Company in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement rely on certain representations, assumptions, undertakings and covenants, and the opinions to be delivered at the consummation of the Merger will be based on similar representations, assumptions, undertakings and covenants, including representation letters from each of Rockwell Collins and the Company. These representations relate to, among other items, confirming the accuracy of the\nrepresentations and warranties originally made with respect to the KLX spin-off, along with compliance with covenants, the actions taken in pursuit of the corporate business purposes of the KLX spin-off, the interaction of the parties, and business developments since the KLX spin-off. If any of the factual representations in any of the representation letters, or any of the assumptions in the tax opinions is untrue or incomplete, an undertaking or covenant is not complied with or the facts upon which a tax opinion is based are materially different from the facts at the time of the Merger, the opinions may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or the courts. As a result, the conclusions expressed in the tax opinions could be challenged by the IRS, and a court may sustain such a challenge. None of Rockwell Collins, the Company or KLX has requested a ruling from the IRS regarding the impact of the Merger on the qualification of the KLX spin-off for the KLX spin-off tax treatment.", "PERMNO": 76138, "SIC": 2531, "TIC": "BEAV"}
