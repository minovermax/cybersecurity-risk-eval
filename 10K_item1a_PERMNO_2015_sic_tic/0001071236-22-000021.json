Risk Factors\nOwnership of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information included in this Report, including the disclosures in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this Report. Any of the following risks, as well as risks of which we are not now aware or currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, to the extent that any of the information in this Report constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.\nRisks Related to the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the ultimate impact will depend on future developments which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is creating extensive disruptions to the global economy and to the lives of individuals throughout the world. Governments, businesses, and the public are taking unprecedented actions to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its effects, including quarantines, travel bans, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief. The pandemic and related efforts to contain it have disrupted global economic activity, adversely affected the functioning of financial markets, prompted decreases in interest rates in 2020, increased economic and market uncertainty, and disrupted trade and supply chains. If these implications continue or result in sustained economic stress, many of the risk factors identified in this Report could be exacerbated and such effects could have a material adverse effect on us related to credit, collateral, interest rate risk, profitability, and operations as described in the following sections.\n\u2022Credit and Collateral Risk. The spread of COVID-19 has caused, and may continue to cause, business shutdowns, limitations on commercial activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions, heightened inflationary pressures, increased unemployment and commercial property vacancy rates, reduced profitability and ability of property owners to make mortgage payments, and overall economic and financial market instability. All of these factors could cause our customers to be unable to make scheduled loan payments. If the effects of COVID-19 result in widespread and sustained repayment shortfalls on loans in our portfolio, we could incur significant delinquencies, foreclosures, and credit losses, particularly if the available collateral is insufficient to cover our exposure.\nThe effects of COVID-19 on economic activity could negatively affect collateral values and our ability to liquidate such collateral. Further, in the event of delinquencies, regulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers may slow or prevent us from making business decisions or delay certain remedial actions, such as foreclosure. All of these factors could cause the level of our nonperforming loans, charge-offs, and delinquencies to increase, potentially requiring significant future provisions for credit losses.\n\u2022Interest Rate Risk. Our net interest income, lending activities, deposits, and profitability could be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates and other factors resulting from uncertainties stemming from COVID-19. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target federal funds rate to 0.25%, citing concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on markets and stress in the energy sector. This low interest rate environment has and could continue to negatively impact our net interest income and net income. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could also cause decreases in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates may impact both the level of income and expense recorded on some of our assets and liabilities and the market value of applicable interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which could, in turn, negatively affect our net income.\n\u2022Profitability Risk. Our profitability has been and could continue to be negatively affected by changes in interest rates as well as other aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Operational Risk. While COVID-19 precautions in terms of physical separation have been reduced, if it becomes necessary to resume all or some of the precautions implemented earlier in the pandemic, our ability to meet customers\u2019 expectations could be limited and have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nMoreover, we rely on many third parties in our business operations, including appraisers of real property collateral; title companies; vendors that supply essential services such as loan servicers, providers of financial information, systems, analytical tools, and electronic payment and settlement systems; and local, state, and federal government agencies, offices, and courthouses. In responding to the pandemic, many of these entities limited, and may again limit, the availability of and access to their services.\nBecause there have been no recent global pandemics of comparable global impact, we do not yet know the full extent of COVID-19\u2019s effects on our business, operations, or the global economy as a whole. Any future development will be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of our social-distancing accommodation arrangements, third party providers\u2019 ability to support our operations, and any actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nAs a participating lender in the PPP, we are subject to risks related to the SBA program and related PPP loans.\nThe CARES Act in March of 2020 and the Economic Aid Act in December of 2020 included a significant loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals could apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enrolled in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. We participated as a lender in the PPP. The PPP became available on April 3, 2020. Due to how quickly each act was passed, there was and continues to be a significant amount of ambiguity and changes in the laws, rules, and guidance regarding requirements for eligibility, underwriting, origination, funding, and forgiveness of PPP loans. Ambiguity, changes, and the speed that was necessary to implement the program expose us to regulatory and legal risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP.\nPPP loans are also subject to regulatory requirements that require forbearance of loan payments for a specified time and limit our ability to pursue all available remedies in the event of a loan default. If a borrower under a PPP loan fails to qualify for loan forgiveness, our risk is heightened because we hold these loans at unfavorable interest rates.\nWe also have credit risk on PPP loans if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may deny its guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or seek recovery from us of any loss related to the deficiency. In addition, we have credit risk related to how forgiveness of PPP loans is handled and how the forgiveness amounts are determined. Governmental agencies have, and may continue to change the rules, create new rules, have a very detailed review process, or require additional forms or paperwork that the borrower may not complete appropriately. All of these items could negatively impact us.\nSince the commencement of the PPP, numerous other banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that those banks used in processing applications for the PPP. We may be exposed to similar litigation from customers, non-customers, and agents that approach us regarding PPP loans and regarding our procedures for processing applications, funding PPP loans, and coordinating the forgiveness of the loans. If any such litigation is initiated against us, it may result in significant financial liability, significant litigation costs, or adversely affect our reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Credit Activities\nWe may not be able to adequately measure and limit our credit risk, which could lead to unexpected losses.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions such as labor and material shortages and supply chain difficulties, and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. The creditworthiness of a borrower is affected by many factors including local market conditions and general economic conditions. If the overall economic climate in the U.S., generally, or in Louisiana, specifically, experiences material disruption, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs, and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for credit losses.\nOur risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of our loans within specific industries and our credit approval, review, and administrative practices may not adequately reduce credit risk. Further, our credit administration personnel, policies, and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of our loan portfolio. A failure to effectively measure and limit our credit risk could result in loan defaults, foreclosures, and additional charge-offs. As a result, we may need to significantly increase our provision, which could adversely affect our net income.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of real estate loans, which subjects us to potential impairment of the collateral securing the loan if the real estate economy experiences negative changes as well as costs and potential risks associated with the ownership of the real property if we are forced to foreclose.\nThe market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area the real estate is located. Real estate values in many Louisiana markets have experienced periods of\nfluctuation over the last several years. As of December 31, 2021, $1.25 billion, or 74.3%, of loans HFI were secured by real estate as the primary component of collateral. We also make loans secured by real estate as a supplemental source of collateral. Real estate values and real estate markets are affected by many factors, such as changes in national, regional, or local economic conditions; the rate of unemployment; fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers; changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes; regulations and policies; and acts of nature, such as hurricanes, flooding, and other natural disasters. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans, and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Consequently, we could be required to increase our allowance for loan losses, adversely affecting profitability. Additionally, we may have to foreclose on the collateral property to protect our investment. We may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we would be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate, including potential environmental liability due to contamination of a property either during ownership or after divesting of it. As of December 31, 2021, we held $660,000 in OREO. This amount could increase in the future, depending upon the level of our real estate foreclosures and our ability to efficiently divest of the foreclosed OREO. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to, general or local economic conditions, environmental cleanup liability, assessments, interest rates, real estate tax rates, operating expenses of the mortgaged properties, ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties, zoning laws, governmental and regulatory rules, and natural disasters.\nOur commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to risks that may be greater than the risks related to other types of loans.\nOur loan portfolio includes non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties, as well as real estate construction and development loans. As of December 31, 2021, our construction and development loans, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, and non-real estate secured loans financing commercial real estate activities totaled $447.6 million, or 26.6%, of loans HFI. These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. This projected income may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. Commercial real estate loans expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because there are fewer potential purchasers for the commercial real estate collateral, which can make liquidation more difficult. Additionally, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, charge-offs on non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans may be larger on an individual loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our commercial real estate loan portfolio would require us to increase our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $474.4 million, or 28.2%, of our total loan portfolio was secured by first liens on one-to-four family residential loans. One-to-four family residential loans are generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the borrowers\u2019 ability to meet their loan payment obligations. A decline in residential real estate values resulting from a downturn in the housing market in our market areas may reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans and increase our risk of losses due to default. A downturn in the housing market coupled with elevated unemployment rates may also result in a decline in demand for our products and services.\nIn addition, interest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increases the potential for default and could result in a decrease in the demand for residential loans. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a residential loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on residential loans as borrowers refinance their loans at lower rates.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans secured by receivables, inventory, equipment, or other commercial collateral, the deterioration in value of which could expose us to credit losses.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $311.4 million, or 18.5%, of loans HFI were commercial and industrial loans collateralized, in general, by general business assets including, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and available real estate, and most are backed by a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. These commercial and industrial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on an individual loan basis. Additionally, the repayment of commercial and industrial loans is subject to the ongoing business operations of the borrower. The collateral securing such loans generally includes movable property, such as equipment and inventory. These types of collateral may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate, exposing us to increased credit risk. In addition, a portion of our customer base, including customers in the energy and real estate\nbusiness, may be exposed to volatile businesses or industries that are sensitive to commodity prices or market fluctuations, such as energy prices. Accordingly, negative changes in commodity prices, real estate values, or liquidity could impair the value of the collateral securing these loans. Significant adverse changes in the economy or local market conditions where our commercial lending customers operate could cause rapid declines in loan collectability and the values associated with general business assets resulting in inadequate collateral coverage.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio.\nWe establish our allowance for loan losses and maintain it at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses based on our analysis of our loan portfolio, our historical loss experience, and conditions within our markets. As of December 31, 2021, our allowance for loan losses totaled $19.2 million, which represents approximately 1.14% of loans HFI. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant information available to us. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships, as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. Additions to the allowance for loan losses, which are charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses, are determined based on a variety of factors, including an analysis of our loan portfolio, historical loss experience, and an evaluation of current economic conditions in our market areas. The actual amount of loan losses is affected by changes in economic, operating, and other conditions within our markets, as well as changes in the financial condition, cash flows, and operations of our borrowers. All of these factors are beyond our control, and such losses may exceed our current estimates.\nAdditional loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have previously experienced or than we anticipate. We may be required to make additional provisions for loan losses to further supplement our allowance for loan losses, due either to our management\u2019s decision or as a regulatory requirement. In addition, bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance for loan losses and the value attributed to nonaccrual loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require us to recognize future charge-offs.\nFinally, the measure of our allowance for loan losses will be subject to new accounting standards. FASB has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for us on January 1, 2023, due to our classification as an SEC registrant with smaller reporting company filing status. This new standard, referred to as CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses. CECL will also greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. The CECL model could create more volatility in the level of our allowance for credit losses after it becomes applicable to us.\nAppraisals and other valuation techniques we use in evaluating and monitoring loans secured by real property, OREO, and repossessed personal property may not accurately describe the net value of the asset.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. Because real estate values may change significantly in relatively short periods of time (especially in periods of heightened economic uncertainty), this estimate may not accurately describe the net value of the real property collateral after the loan is made. As a result, we may not be able to realize the full amount of any remaining indebtedness when we foreclose on and sell the relevant property. In addition, we rely on appraisals and other valuation techniques to establish the value of our OREO and personal property that we acquire through foreclosure and to determine certain loan impairments. If any of these valuations are inaccurate, our combined and consolidated financial statements may not reflect the correct value of our OREO or personal property, and our allowance for loan losses may not reflect accurate loan impairments.\nThe amount of our nonperforming and classified assets may increase significantly, resulting in additional losses, costs, and expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had NPAs of $979,000, or 0.03% of total assets. NPAs adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on OREO or on nonperforming loans, which adversely affects our income. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to market value of the collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss. An increase in the level of NPAs also increases our risk profile, which may cause our regulators to require additional amounts of capital. Finally, NPAs can take significant time and resources to resolve, causing the related costs of maintaining those assets to increase. These effects may be particularly pronounced in a market of reduced real estate values and excess inventory.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans.\nA significant portion of our business development and marketing strategy is focused on small to medium-sized businesses. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be\nmore vulnerable to economic downturns, inflation, and labor market and supply chain constraints; may often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete; and may experience substantial volatility in operating results. Any of these factors may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small or medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents, and efforts of one individual or a small group of individuals. The death, disability, or resignation of one or more of these people could have an adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay loans.\nWe could be subject to losses, regulatory action, or reputational harm due to fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, our employees, and other parties.\nIn deciding whether and upon what terms to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, property appraisals, title information, employment and income documentation, account information, and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Any misrepresentation or incorrect or incomplete information, whether fraudulent or inadvertent, may not be detected prior to entering into the transaction. In addition, one or more of our employees could cause a significant breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our loan documentation, operations, or systems. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or another third party, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. We are often contractually required to indemnify counterparties for losses caused by a material misrepresentation, and a loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically not marketable or, if sold, is subject to repurchase. The sources of the misrepresentations may also be difficult to locate, and we may be unable to recover any of the monetary losses we may suffer as a result.\nRisks Related to Interest Rates and Economic Conditions\nWe are subject to risks due to changing interest rates.\nThe majority of our banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, our earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent upon the level of our net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments, and other interest-earning assets, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. When interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive as of December 31, 2021, meaning that our assets have the opportunity to reprice at a faster pace than our liabilities. Consequently, we estimate our net interest income would decrease in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment.\nInterest rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, recessions, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder, and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, our cost of funds, and our loan origination volume. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may, among other things, increase prepayments within the loan portfolio and on mortgage-backed securities within the securities portfolio, and increase competition for deposits. An increase in the general level of interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and decrease loan repayment rates. Increases could also adversely affect the ability of borrowers of floating rate loans to meet their higher payment obligations, which could in turn lead to an increase in NPAs and charge-offs.\nNatural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, the impact of pandemics, civil unrest, and other external events could result in a disruption of our operations and increases in loan losses.\nWe are a community banking franchise concentrated in Louisiana. A significant portion of our business is generated from Louisiana markets that have been, and may continue to be, damaged by major hurricanes, floods, tropical storms, tornadoes, ice storms, and other natural disasters. As of December 31, 2021, 94.0% of loans HFI were made to borrowers who reside or conduct business in Louisiana, and substantially all of our real estate loans are secured by properties located in Louisiana. Natural disasters can disrupt our operations, cause widespread property damage, and severely depress the local economies in which we operate. A deterioration in local economic conditions or in the residential or commercial real estate markets could have an adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio, the demand for our products and services, the ability of borrowers to timely repay loans, and the value of the collateral securing loans. If the population, employment, or income growth in any of our markets is negative or slower than projected, income levels, deposits, and real estate development could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our business could be adversely affected by the effects of war and international conflict, civil unrest, inflation, labor market constraints, or a widespread outbreak of disease pandemics, including the ongoing pandemic caused by COVID-19.\nWe are monitoring the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While we do not expect that the conflict will be directly material to us, associated effects of the geopolitical instability, such as the imposition of sanctions against Russia and Russia\u2019s response to such sanctions (including retaliatory acts like cyber-attacks and sanctions against other countries), could adversely affect the global economy or domestic markets, including ours.\nIf the economies in our primary markets experience an overall decline as a result of these types of external events, demand for loans and our other products and services could be reduced. In addition, the rate of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies, and losses on loan portfolios may increase substantially, as uninsured property losses or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans. Such external events could, therefore, result in decreased revenue and increased loan losses.\nAs a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways.\nOur business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to customers in the form of loans, borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits, and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. Our business environment can be impacted by uncertainty about the federal fiscal and monetary policymaking process. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control. Federal fiscal and monetary policymaking decisions could lead to changes in interest rates, inflation, or other economic impacts such as supply chain issues and labor market constraints. The primary impact of inflation on our operations most likely will be reflected in increased operating costs.\nThe medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government and U.S. economy are concerns for businesses, consumers, and investors in the U.S. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries, including global political hostilities, could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder domestic economic growth. Uncertainty regarding both short and long-term interest rates impacts our ability to attract deposits and manage net interest margin.\nThe borrowing needs of our customers may increase, especially during a challenging economic environment, which could result in increased borrowing against our contractual obligations to extend credit.\nA commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established under the agreement. The actual borrowing needs of our customers under these credit commitments have historically been lower than the contractual amount of the commitments. Because of the credit profile of our customers, we typically have a substantial amount of total unfunded credit commitments, which is not reflected on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, we had $370.4 million in unfunded credit commitments to our customers. Actual borrowing needs of our customers may exceed our expectations, especially during a challenging economic environment when our customers may be more dependent on our credit commitments due to the lack of available credit elsewhere, the increasing costs of credit, or the limited availability of financings from alternative sources. This could adversely affect our liquidity, which could impair our ability to fund operations and meet obligations as they become due.\nVolatility in oil prices and downturns in the energy industry, particularly in Louisiana, could lead to increased credit losses in our loan portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had non-PPP energy loans of $19.8 million, or 1.2%, of non-PPP loans HFI (non-GAAP). For further information on non-GAAP financial measures, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d We also may have indirect exposure to energy prices, as some of our non-energy customers\u2019 businesses may be affected by volatility with the oil and gas industry and the impact of inflation on energy prices. General uncertainty resulting from continued volatility could have other adverse impacts such as job losses in industries tied to energy, lower borrowing needs, higher transaction deposit balances, or a number of other effects that are difficult to isolate or quantify, particularly in states with significant dependence on the energy industry like Louisiana.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe rely heavily on our executive management team and other key employees, and we could be adversely affected by an unexpected loss of their service.\nOur success depends in large part on the performance of our key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain highly qualified management and employees. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business plan may be lengthy. We may not be successful in retaining our key employees. If we unexpectedly lose the services of one or more of our key personnel, we would also lose the benefit of their skills, knowledge of our primary markets, and years of industry experience. We may not be able to identify and hire qualified replacement personnel on terms acceptable to us, or at all, whether due to tightening labor conditions or otherwise.\nWe are subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security, and protection of personal information. Unauthorized access, cyber-crime, and other threats to data security may require significant resources, harm our reputation, and otherwise cause harm to our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we necessarily collect, use, and retain, on various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third party data service providers, personal and financial information concerning individuals and businesses with which we have a banking relationship. We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information about our operations. Threats to data security such as unauthorized access and cyber-attacks emerge and change rapidly. These threats may increase our costs for protection or remediation. They may also result in competing time constraints between applicable privacy and other requirements and our ability to secure data in accordance with customer expectations and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information.\nIt is difficult or impossible to defend against every risk posed by changing technologies and cyber-crime. Increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks makes it increasingly difficult to prevent a security breach. Controls employed by our information technology department, our other employees, and our vendors could prove inadequate. We, or any of our vendors or third-party providers, could also experience a breach due to circumstances such as intentional or negligent conduct on the part of employees or other internal and external sources, software bugs, or other technical malfunctions. Any of these threats may cause our customer accounts and financial systems to become vulnerable to takeover schemes or cyber-fraud. If personal, confidential, or proprietary information of customers, employees, or others were to be mishandled or misused by us or third parties with access to that information, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under personal information laws and regulations. Cyber incidents could include actual or attempted unauthorized access, tampering, malware insertion, ransomware attacks or other system integrity events. A breach of our security that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, fines, penalties, damages, inquiries, examinations, investigations, significant increases in compliance costs, and reputational damage, which could cause us to lose customers or potential customers.\nWe rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure, and a failure of these parties to perform for any reason could disrupt our operations.\nThird parties provide key components of our business infrastructure such as data processing, internet connections, network access, core application processing, statement production, and account analysis. Our business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity. Additionally, our operations could be interrupted if any of our third-party service providers experience financial difficulty, are inadvertently or intentionally negligent, are subject to cybersecurity breaches, terminate their services, or fail to comply with applicable banking regulations.\nWe are subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings that could result in legal liability.\nFrom time to time, we are, or may be, involved in various legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. One or more unfavorable outcomes of these ordinary course claims or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect. In addition, regardless of their merits, scope, validity, or ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, time-consuming, may result in protracted litigation or otherwise divert management\u2019s attention, and may materially and adversely affect our reputation, even if resolved favorably.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. As we continue to grow, our success will be partially dependent upon our ability to address the needs of our customers and enhance operational efficiencies through the use of technology. We may experience operational challenges as we implement these new technology products or enhancements. As a result, we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from our new technology, or we may incur significant costs to overcome related challenges in a timely manner.\nMany of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we may lose customers seeking technology-driven products and services that we are not able to provide.\nOur financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amount of related revenues and expenses. Certain accounting policies are inherently based to a greater extent on estimates, assumptions, and judgments of management and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally estimated. These policies include the allowance for loan losses, accounting for income taxes, the determination of fair value for financial instruments, and accounting for stock-based compensation. Management\u2019s judgment and the data relied upon by management may be based on assumptions that prove to be inaccurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if the relevant, factual assumptions are accurate, our decisions may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in the design or use of analytical tools used by management.\nWe are dependent on the use of data and modeling in our management\u2019s decision-making, and faulty data or modeling approaches could negatively impact our decision-making ability or subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nThe use of statistical and quantitative models and other quantitative analysis is intrinsic to bank decision-making and is becoming increasingly widespread in our operations. It is also becoming more prevalent in regulatory compliance. While we are not currently subject to annual stress testing under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review submissions, we currently utilize stress testing for monitoring and managing interest rate risk and liquidity. We also use a loan pricing model to help price loans, as well as an ALL model to evaluate the ALL. While we believe the quantitative techniques and approaches of these models improve our decision-making, they also create the possibility that faulty data, flawed quantitative approaches, or misunderstanding or misuse of their outputs could negatively impact our decision-making ability or, if we become subject to regulatory stress-testing in the future, cause adverse regulatory scrutiny.\nWe utilize third-party companies to support our investment group, and we may be adversely affected by the condition or performance of our third-party brokerage partners.\nWe are not registered with the SEC as an investment advisor or broker-dealer. To provide a broader range of investment products and services to our customers through our investment group, we partner with third-parties who are licensed and registered to serve in those capacities. The investment products and services provided to our customers through our investment group, by virtue of these third-party channels generally are not insured by the FDIC. Therefore, we may have exposure for illegal, negligent, fraudulent, or other acts of these investment advisors and brokers. Although we seek to limit this exposure through clear disclosure, ongoing oversight, and contractual provisions requiring indemnification, limitations of liability, insurance coverage, and other similar protections, those obligations may not always be enforceable, or our third-party service providers ultimately may not have sufficient financial strength to fully comply.\nRisks Related to Our Competition and Services\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and maintain our reputation is critical to our growth, profitability, and market share.\nWe operate in the highly competitive banking industry and face significant competition for customers from bank and non-bank competitors. Our business plan emphasizes relationship banking in order to originate loans, attract deposits, and provide other financial services. As a result, our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. Our competitors are generally larger and may have significantly more resources, greater name recognition, and more extensive and established branch networks or geographic footprints. Because of their scale, many of these competitors can be more aggressive on loan and deposit pricing. Also, many of our non-bank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Credit unions have become more active in organic growth and growth through acquisitions, and their tax-exempt status may enable them to compete more effectively on rates. We expect competition to continue to intensify due to financial institution consolidation; legislative, regulatory, and technological changes; and the emergence of alternative sources for financial services, including fintech companies, which could cause us to lose some of our existing customers, and we may not be successful attracting new customers. Our failure to compete effectively in our primary markets could cause us to lose market share.\nWe may not be able to implement our expansion strategy, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends.\nOur strategy is to expand market share in existing markets and engage in opportunistic new market de novo expansion, supplemented by strategic acquisitions of financial institutions with customer-oriented, compatible philosophies and in desirable geographic areas. De novo expansion carries with it certain potential risks, including possibly significant startup costs and anticipated initial operating losses; an inability to gain regulatory approval; an inability to secure the services of qualified senior management to operate the de novo banking center and successfully integrate and promote our corporate\nculture; poor market reception for de novo banking centers established in markets where we do not have a preexisting reputation; challenges posed by local economic conditions; challenges associated with securing attractive locations at a reasonable cost; and additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values; therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and earnings per common share may occur in connection with any future acquisition. Specifically, acquisitions could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, or other consequences that could adversely affect our business. Further, the carrying amount of any goodwill that we currently maintain or may acquire may be subject to impairment in future periods.\nAlso, as consolidation of the financial services industry continues, the number of appropriate targets may decrease and the price for potential acquisitions may increase, which could reduce our potential returns and reduce the attractiveness of these opportunities to us. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully consolidate any business or assets we acquire with our existing business. The integration of acquired operations and assets may require substantial management time, effort, and resources and may divert management\u2019s focus from other strategic opportunities and operational matters.\nFurther, we may not be able to execute on more general aspects of our expansion strategy, which may impair our ability to sustain our historical rate of growth or prevent us from growing at all. We may not be able to generate sufficient new loans and deposits within acceptable risk and expense tolerances, obtain the personnel or funding necessary for additional growth, or find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition with other financial institutions, may impede or prohibit the growth of our operations, the opening of new banking centers, and the consummation of acquisitions. The success of our strategy also depends on our ability to effectively manage growth, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to adapt our credit, operational, technology, and governance infrastructure to accommodate expanded operations. If we fail to implement one or more aspects of our expansion strategy, we may be unable to maintain our historical growth and earnings trends.\nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements, or services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we implement new lines of business or offer new products and product enhancements as well as new services within our existing lines of business. In doing so, we may invest significant time and resources. At the same time, we may not allocate the appropriate level of resources or expertise necessary to make these new efforts successful or to realize their expected benefits. Further, initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business, products, product enhancements, or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the ultimate implementation. Any new line of business, product, product enhancement, or service could also have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other financial intermediaries. In addition, we participate in loans originated by other institutions, and we participate in syndicated transactions (including shared national credits) in which other lenders serve as the lead bank. As a result, defaults by, declines in the financial condition of, or even rumors or questions about one or more financial institutions, financial service companies, or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity, asset quality, or other problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Stability\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, we may not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain adequate protection against financial stress.\nWe must satisfy ongoing regulatory capital requirements, and regulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels. We may then need to raise additional capital to comply with these requirements or to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on a number of factors, including without limitation our financial condition and performance, conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, and governmental activities. Many of these factors are beyond our control, and as such, there is no assurance we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain capital sufficient to meet regulatory requirements, we may not be able to withstand periods of financial stress and we could be subject to enforcement actions or other regulatory consequences.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in adverse changes to the portfolio\u2019s fair value. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions related to the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying collateral, and changes in market interest rates and instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause OTTI and realized or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary often requires complex, subjective judgments about whether there has been a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer, whether management has the intent or ability to hold a security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any underlying collateral, and other relevant factors.\nWe may be adversely affected by the transition from LIBOR.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Subsequently, on March 5, 2021, it was announced that certain USD-LIBOR rates would cease to be published after June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR.\nAs of December 31, 2021, 3.6% of loans HFI were indexed to LIBOR with a setting that expires June 30, 2023. These loans contain either provisions for the designation of an alternate benchmark rate or \u201cfallback\u201d provisions providing for alternative rate calculations in the event LIBOR is unavailable. However, the existing provisions and/or recent modifications to our documents to address the transition may not adequately address the actual changes to LIBOR or the financial impact of successor benchmark rates. Even with provisions allowing for designation of alternative benchmarks or \u201cfallback\u201d provisions, changes to or the discontinuance of LIBOR could result in customer uncertainty and disputes arising as a consequence of the transition from LIBOR.\nA lack of liquidity could impair our ability to fund operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. Our most important source of funds is deposits. Historically, our deposits have provided a stable source of funds. However, deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. Even though a majority of our certificates of deposit renew upon maturity with what we believe are competitive rates, some of our more rate-sensitive customers may move those funds to higher-yielding alternatives. If our customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs, and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nOur other primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, and proceeds from the issuance and sale of our equity to investors. As a secondary source of liquidity, we have the ability to borrow overnight funds from other financial institutions with whom we have a correspondent relationship. We also have the ability to borrow from the FHLB of Dallas. Historically, we have not utilized brokered or internet deposits to meet liquidity needs.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us, the financial services industry, or the economy in general. These factors may include disruptions in the financial markets or negative expectations about the industry\u2019s prospects. Our access to funding sources could also be affected by regulatory actions against us or by a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a downturn in the Louisiana economy or in economic conditions generally. A decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or fulfill obligations such as meeting deposit withdrawal demands or repaying our borrowings.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation, and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, could subject us to regulatory action or penalties.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect our shareholders or creditors. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect consumers, customers, depositors, the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund, and the overall financial stability of the U.S. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements,\nimpose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividends or distributions that Red River Bank can pay to us and that we can pay to our shareholders, impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than GAAP would require, require us to have an effective anti-money laundering program, and prohibit discriminatory lending practices and unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith efforts or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base, and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules, and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive.\nFor additional information regarding laws and regulation to which our business is subject, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future, may increase our costs.\nCurrent and past economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. New proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry; impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates, financial product offerings, and disclosures; and have an effect on collection and bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things.\nCertain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities by requiring more oversight or changing certain of our business practices, including our ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads. They also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make necessary operational changes to comply.\nNew activities and expansion require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nAs opportunities arise, we plan to continue establishing de novo banking centers as a part of our organic growth strategy. In addition, we may complement and expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial institutions and other complementary businesses. Generally, we must receive state and federal regulatory approval before we can acquire an FDIC-insured depository institution or related business. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may also be required to open or sell banking centers as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition. De novo expansion and any acquisitions carry with them numerous risks, including the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals.\nFederal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions as a result of such examinations could result in regulatory action or penalties.\nAs part of the bank regulatory process, the FDIC, the OFI, and the Federal Reserve periodically conduct examinations of our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal or state banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we or the Bank were in violation of any law or regulation, such agency may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to stop any practices such agency found to be unsafe or unsound; to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice; to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced; to direct an increase in our capital; to restrict our ability to pay dividends; to restrict our growth; to assess civil money penalties against us, the Bank, or our respective officers and directors; to remove officers and directors; and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance and place it into receivership or conservatorship.\nWe are subject to capital requirements, which may result in lower returns on equity, require us to raise additional capital, limit growth opportunities, result in regulatory restrictions, or require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nBecause the Bank does not intend to utilize the simplified CBLR framework, it remains subject to rules designed to implement the recommendations with respect to regulatory capital standards, commonly known as Basel III. The rules establish a regulatory capital standard based on common equity Tier I, require the Bank to satisfy a minimum capital adequacy requirement, and impose a CCB. Failure to meet the CCB will result in certain limitations on dividends, stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.\nOur subsidiary, Red River Bank, is also subject to separate regulatory capital requirements imposed by the FDIC. If the Bank does not meet minimum capital requirements, it will be subject to prompt corrective action by the FDIC. Prompt corrective action can include progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management, and capital distributions. Even if we satisfy the objectives of our capital plan and meet minimum capital requirements, it is possible that our regulators may ask us to raise additional capital. For example, banking organizations experiencing significant internal growth or making acquisitions are often expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank. The Federal Reserve requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support its subsidiary banks. Under this \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank at times when the bank holding company may not be inclined to do so and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Accordingly, we could be required to make a capital injection to the Bank if it experiences financial distress. Such a capital injection may be required at a time when our resources are limited, and we may be required to borrow the funds or to raise additional equity capital to make the required capital injection.\nFederal, state, and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans, increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans, increase the time and expense associated with the foreclosure process, or prevent us from foreclosing at all.\nCertain federal, state, and local laws are intended to eliminate lending practices which are considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans, and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is our policy not to make predatory loans, but these laws create the potential for liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans. They also may cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make. Additionally, consumer protection initiatives or changes in state or federal law may substantially increase the time and expense associated with the foreclosure process or prevent us from foreclosing at all.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance.\nDeposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and subject to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The Bank\u2019s regular assessments are determined by the level of its assessment base and its risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. The FDIC has the power to change deposit insurance assessment rates, the manner deposit insurance is calculated, and also to charge special assessments to FDIC-insured institutions. Any future additional assessments, increases, or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could adversely impact our earnings.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations.\nFuture changes in tax laws may have an adverse effect on our income tax expense, deferred tax balances, and the amount of taxes payable.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial fluctuations, which may make it difficult to sell shares at the volumes, prices, or times desired.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency and is subject to price fluctuations and risk of loss. There are many factors that may impact the market price and trading volume of our common stock. In particular, the realization of any of the risks described in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Report could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, causing the price of our common stock to decline. The stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks has experienced substantial fluctuations in recent years, which in many cases has been unrelated to the operating performance and prospects of particular companies. In addition, significant fluctuations in the trading volume in our common stock may cause significant price variations to occur. Increased market volatility could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, which could make it difficult for investors to sell shares at volumes, prices, or times desired and could result in a risk of loss.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our equity securities in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nWe may issue shares of equity securities as consideration for future acquisitions and investments and under compensation and incentive plans. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our equity securities in connection with any such acquisition or investment. Sales of substantial amounts of our equity securities, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of our securities.\nOur directors and executive officers have significant control over our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately 22.1% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Consequently, our management and board of directors may be able to significantly affect the outcome of the election of directors and the potential outcome of other matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, such as mergers, the sale of substantially all of our assets, and other extraordinary corporate matters. The interests of these insiders could conflict with the interests of our other shareholders.\nThe rights of our common shareholders may be subordinate to the holders of any debt securities or preferred stock that we may issue in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any outstanding long-term debt. However, any future indebtedness that we may incur may be senior to our common stock. As a result, we would make payments on our potential future indebtedness before any dividends could be paid on our common stock, and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution, or liquidation, the holders of our potential future indebtedness would be satisfied in full before any distributions could be made to the holders of our common stock.\nAlthough we have not historically issued shares of preferred stock, our board of directors has the authority to issue in the aggregate up to 1,000,000 such shares, and to determine the terms of each issuance of preferred stock and any indebtedness, without shareholder approval, which may be senior to our common stock. As a result, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These include, without limitation, an exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced financial reporting requirements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the end of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (2) December 31, 2024, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions, which may result in a less active trading market and increased volatility in our stock price.\nOur dividend policy may change without notice, and our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. Although we anticipate paying quarterly dividends going forward, we have no obligation to continue paying dividends, and we may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to our shareholders. Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited on account of any potential future outstanding indebtedness, as we generally would make payments on outstanding indebtedness before any dividends could be paid on our common stock. Also, because our primary earning asset is our investment in the capital stock of the Bank, we may become dependent upon dividends from the Bank to pay our operating expenses, satisfy our obligations, and pay dividends on our common stock. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will substantially depend upon its earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. There are numerous laws and banking regulations and guidance that limit our and the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends. For more information on dividend regulations, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nOur corporate governance documents, and certain corporate and banking laws applicable to us, could make a takeover more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended and restated, and corporate and federal banking laws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our organization or conduct a proxy contest, even if those events were perceived by many of our shareholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions, and the corporate and banking laws and regulations applicable to us, enable our board of directors to issue additional shares of authorized, but unissued capital stock; specify that our shareholders do not have preemptive rights; issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights, and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the board; increase the size of the board and fill the vacancies created by the increase; not be elected by cumulative voting; amend our bylaws without shareholder approval; require the request of holders of at least 25.0% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote at a meeting to call a special shareholders\u2019 meeting; establish an advance notice procedure for director nominations and other shareholder proposals; and require prior regulatory application and approval of any transaction involving control of our organization.\nThese provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, including under circumstances in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the market price of our shares.\nSecurities analysts may not continue coverage on us.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these securities analysts, and they may not cover us. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of our common stock to decline. If we are covered by securities analysts and are the subject of an unfavorable report, the price of our common stock may decline.\nOur stock repurchase program may not enhance long-term stockholder value, and stock repurchases, if any, could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nSince August 2020, we have maintained stock repurchase programs. The repurchase programs authorize us to purchase up to a set amount of our outstanding shares of common stock between specific dates. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing prices and based on market conditions, or in privately negotiated transactions.\nRepurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, repurchases under our stock repurchase program will diminish our cash reserves, which impacts our ability to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions, support our operations, invest in securities, and pay dividends and could result in lower overall returns on our cash balances. Stock repurchases may not enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.", "PERMNO": 18668, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "RRBI"}
