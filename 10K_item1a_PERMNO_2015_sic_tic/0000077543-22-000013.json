RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Set forth below, and elsewhere in this report, are descriptions of the material risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate contract risks, revenue or costs, economic factors such as inflation, the timing of new awards, or the pace of project execution, we may incur a loss or achieve lower than anticipated profit.\nAccounting for contract-related revenue and costs requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that may change substantially throughout the project lifecycle, which has previously resulted, and in the future could result, in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, cost overruns, including unanticipated cost increases on fixed price contracts (including contracts performed under the design-build project delivery method, in which we assume the risks associated with the design of the project) and guaranteed maximum price contracts, have previously resulted, and in the future may result, in lower profits or losses. Economic factors, including inflation, could also subject us to higher costs, which we may not be able to fully recover in future projects that we are bidding, and may also decrease profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed price, unit price and guaranteed maximum price contracts. Changes in laws, policies or regulations, including tariffs and taxes, have previously impacted, and in the future could impact, the prices for materials or equipment. Further, our results of operations have historically fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, quarterly and annually depending on when new awards occur and the commencement and progress of work on projects already awarded.\nWe are involved in a significant number of legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorable to us, could adversely affect our financial results and/or cash flows, harm our reputation and/or preclude us from bidding on future projects. We also may invest significant working capital on projects while legal proceedings are being settled.\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, including the legal proceedings described under Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to accurately predict what the final outcome will be of any legal proceeding. We must make certain assumptions and rely on estimates, which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, regarding potential outcomes of legal proceedings in order to determine an appropriate contingent liability and charge to income. Any adverse legal proceeding outcome or settlement that is materially different from our expectations and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. This may include requiring us to record an expense or reduce revenue that we previously recorded based on our expectations or estimates, requiring us to pay damages or reducing cash collections that we had expected to receive. For example, on December 13, 2019, we received an adverse jury verdict in the case related to the construction of the SR 99 project by a joint venture for which the Company holds a 45% share as a minority partner. As a result of the unexpected adverse jury verdict, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $166.8 million in 2019. Refer to the Alaskan Way Viaduct Matter in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In addition, any adverse judgments could harm our reputation and preclude us from bidding on future projects.\nWe may bring claims against project owners for additional cost exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial results and could result in further legal proceedings.\nOur contracts often require us to perform extra work beyond the initial project scope, which can result in disputes or claims and adversely affect our working capital, profits and cash flows.\nOur contracts often require us to perform extra work beyond the initial project scope as directed by the customer even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope and/or price of the work to be performed. This process has resulted and in the future could result in disputes or claims over whether the work performed is beyond the scope of work directed by the customer and/or exceeds the price the customer is willing to pay for the work performed. To the extent we do not recover our costs for this work or there are delays in the recovery of these costs, our working capital, profits and cash flows could continue to be adversely impacted.\nCompetition for new project awards is intense, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce our market share and profits.\nNew project awards are determined through either a competitive bid basis or on a negotiated basis. Projects may be awarded based solely upon price, but often take into account other factors, such as technical qualifications, proposed project team, schedule and past performance on similar projects. Within our industry, we compete with many international, regional and local construction firms. If we are unable to compete successfully in such markets, our relative market share and profits could be reduced.\nThe coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic has adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption for the Company, our customers, subcontractors and suppliers, and the markets in which we do business. The scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and new strains of the COVID-19 virus have emerged. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced delays in certain bidding activities and also in legal proceedings and settlement discussions where we have claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. Consequently, our ability to resolve and recover on these types of claims has been and may continue to be delayed, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial results.\nIt remains difficult to assess the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business, including the impact of actions that may continue to be taken in response to the pandemic and the impacts that the pandemic will have on our employees, our operating segments and practices, our customers, subcontractors and suppliers, and the regions that we serve, or on our financial condition and results of operations as a whole. The full impact depends on many factors that remain uncertain and subject to ongoing volatility, or that are not yet identifiable, and in many cases are out of our control. These factors could include, among other things: (1) the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the types and magnitude of adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies; (2) the health and welfare, and general availability, of our employees, and those of our customers, subcontractors and suppliers; (3) evolving business and government actions in response to the pandemic, including, but not limited to, social distancing measures, new or increased COVID-19 testing and/or vaccination requirements, and additional health and safety requirements that we may be required to observe in order to continue working on our projects; (4) the varying impact that the pandemic may have on industries we serve and on government spending for infrastructure projects, including reduced government spending on infrastructure as a result of lower revenues from taxes, tolls and fares; (5) the response of our customers or prospective customers to the pandemic, including potential future delays, stoppages or terminations of existing projects or potential new awards; (6) delays in the settlement of receivables if customers are unable to pay, fail to make timely payments, request financial concessions or if we continue to experience delays in resolving claims and disputes (e.g., further delays in court proceedings or settlement discussions); (7) limitations and higher costs associated with obtaining financing; (8) the impact of higher inflation that has resulted, at least in part, from market and government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and how long elevated inflation levels may persist, which may increase the cost of labor and materials; (9) supply chain and related logistical challenges that could further limit the availability or increase the cost of materials; (10) potential interruptions to our information systems and technology or breaches in our data security due to increasing use of remote communications and access; and (11) the extent to which COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine boosters are effective against the various current and future virus strains. Such factors may continue to result in fewer or delayed project bidding opportunities or additional or further delays on existing projects.\nAny of these events or impacts we have experienced or identified have caused or contributed to, and could continue to cause or contribute to, the risks and uncertainties facing the Company and our customers and could continue to materially and adversely affect our business or portions thereof, and our financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and the volatile economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of COVID-19, could also aggravate or heighten the risks posed by other risk factors that we have identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere may be other adverse consequences to our business, financial condition and results of operations from the spread of COVID-19 that are not presently known or that have not yet become apparent. As a result, we cannot assure you that if the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it would not have a further adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions could adversely affect our operations.\nAny significant decline in economic conditions in any of the markets we serve or uncertainty regarding the economic outlook could result in a decline in demand for infrastructure projects and commercial building developments. In addition, any instability in the financial and credit markets could negatively impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay us on a timely basis, or at all, for work on projects already under construction, could cause our customers to delay or cancel construction projects in our backlog or could create difficulties for customers to obtain adequate financing to fund new construction projects. Such consequences could have an adverse impact on our future operating results. Lastly, we are more susceptible to adverse economic conditions in New York and California, as a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in those states.\nOur actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements.\nIn preparing our financial statements, we are required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 recognition of contract revenue, costs, profits or losses in applying the principles of revenue accounting;\n\u2022 recognition of revenue related to project incentives or awards we expect to receive;\n\u2022 recognition of recoveries under unapproved change orders or claims;\n\u2022 estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract closeout or other costs;\n\u2022 collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable;\n\u2022 asset valuations;\n\u2022 income tax provisions and related valuation allowances;\n\u2022 determination of expense and potential liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and\n\u2022 accruals for other estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations.\nThe construction services industry is highly schedule driven, and our failure to meet the schedule requirements of our contracts could adversely affect our reputation and/or expose us to financial liability.\nMany of our contracts are subject to specific completion schedule requirements. Failure to meet contractual schedule requirements has subjected us, and in the future could subject us, to liquidated damages, liability for our customer\u2019s actual cost arising out of our delay and damage to our reputation.\nWe may not fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog due to cancellations or reductions in scope.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our backlog of uncompleted construction work was approximately $8.2 billion. The revenue projected in our backlog may not be fully realized and, in some cases, if realized, may not result in profits or may be less profitable than expected. The cancellation or reduction in scope of significant projects included in our backlog could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe require substantial personnel, including construction and project managers and specialty subcontractor resources, to execute and perform on our contracts in backlog. The successful execution of our business strategies is also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain our key officers, as well as adequately plan for their succession.\nOur ability to execute and perform on our contracts in backlog depends in large part upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled personnel, including project and construction management and trade labor resources, such as carpenters, masons and other skilled workers. In the event we are unable to attract, hire and retain the requisite personnel and subcontractors necessary to execute and perform on our contracts in backlog, we may experience delays in completing projects in accordance with project schedules or an increase in expected costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, our reputation and our relationships. In addition, if we lack the personnel and specialty subcontractors necessary to perform on our current contract backlog, we may find it necessary to curtail our pursuit of new projects. A significant, rapid growth in our backlog has led, and could continue to lead, to situations in which labor resources become constrained.\nThe execution of our business strategies also substantially depends on our ability to retain several key members of our management. Losing any of these individuals could adversely affect our business. The majority of these key individuals are not bound by employment agreements. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key individuals to whom we have provided share-based compensation. If we lose any key officer due to voluntary or involuntary termination, including as a result of death or disability, and we do not have qualified successors in place, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe level of federal, state and local government spending for infrastructure and other public projects could adversely affect the number of projects available to us in the future.\nThe civil construction and public-works building markets are dependent on the amount of work funded by various government agencies, which depends on many factors, including the condition of the existing infrastructure and buildings; the need for new or expanded infrastructure and buildings; and federal, state and local government spending levels. As a result, our future operating results could be negatively impacted by any decrease in demand for public projects or decrease or delay in government funding (even with the passage of the IIJA), which could result from a variety of factors, including extended government shutdowns, delays in the sale of voter-approved bonds, budget shortfalls, credit rating downgrades or long-term impairment in the ability of state and local governments to raise capital in the municipal bond market.\nSystems and information technology interruption and breaches in data security and/or privacy could adversely impact our ability to operate and negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on computer, information and communication technology and other related systems, some of which are hosted by third party providers, for various business processes and activities, including project management, accounting, financial reporting and business development. These systems have been and may, in the future, be subject to interruptions or damage by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, cyber-attacks, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of war, computer viruses, email phishing, obsolescence and physical damage. Such interruptions can result in a loss of critical data, a delay in operations, damage to our reputation or an unintentional disclosure of customer confidential or personally identifiable information, any of which could have a material adverse impact on us and our consolidated financial statements.\nCybersecurity risks include potential attacks on both our information technology infrastructure and those of third parties (both on premises and in the cloud) attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties. We dedicate considerable attention and resources to the safeguarding of our information technology systems. Nevertheless, due to the evolving nature, persistence, sophistication and volume of cyber-attacks, we may not be successful in defending our systems against all such attacks. Consequently, we have engaged, and may again need to engage, significant resources to remediate the impact of, or further mitigate the risk of, such an attack. Any successful cyber-attack can result in the criminal, or otherwise illegitimate use of, confidential data, including our data or third-party data for which we have the responsibility for safekeeping. Additionally, such an attack could have a material adverse impact on our operations, reputation and financial results.\nIn addition, various privacy and security laws and regulations requiring us to protect sensitive and confidential information from disclosure continue to evolve and pose increasingly complex compliance challenges. Compliance with evolving data privacy laws and regulations may cause us to incur additional costs, and any violation could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur participation in construction joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures by our partners.\nAs part of our business, we enter into joint venture arrangements typically to jointly bid on and execute particular projects, thereby reducing our risk profile while enhancing execution capabilities and increasing surety bonding capacity. Success on these joint projects depends in large part on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations. Generally, we and our joint venture partners are jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner\u2019s shortfall. Further, if we are unable to adequately address our partner\u2019s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm our reputation, reduce our profit on a project or, in some cases, result in a loss.\nOur international operations expose us to economic, political, regulatory and other risks, as well as uncertainty related to U.S. Government funding, which could adversely affect our revenue and earnings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we derived $374.1 million of revenue from our work on projects located outside of the United States. Our international operations expose us to risks inherent in doing business in certain hostile regions outside the United States, including political risks; risks of loss due to acts of war; unstable economic, financial and market conditions; potential incompatibility with foreign subcontractors and vendors; foreign currency controls and fluctuations; trade restrictions; logistical challenges; variations in taxes; and changes in labor conditions, labor strikes and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. Failure to successfully manage risks associated with our international operations could result in higher operating costs than anticipated or could delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and income from construction operations in key international markets.\nThe U.S. federal government has approved various spending bills for the construction of defense- and diplomacy-related projects and has allocated significant funds to the defense of U.S. interests around the world from the threat of terrorism. The federal government has also approved funds for development in conjunction with the relocation of military personnel into Guam. However, federal government funding levels for construction projects in the Middle East have decreased significantly over the past several years as the U.S. government has reduced the number of military troops and support personnel in the region. As a result, we have seen a decrease in the number and size of federal government projects available to us in this region. Any decrease in U.S. federal government funding for projects in Guam or in other U.S. Territories or countries in which we are pursuing work may result in project delays or cancellations, which could reduce our revenue and earnings.\nWeather can significantly affect our revenue and profitability.\nInclement weather conditions, such as significant storms and unusual temperatures, can impact our ability to perform work. Adverse weather conditions can cause delays and increases in project costs, resulting in variability in our revenue and profitability.\nWe are subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations.\nOur contracts with U.S. federal, as well as state, local and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, most of these contracts provide for termination or renegotiation by the government at any time, without cause, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business and growth strategy, impact our stock price and adversely affect our reputation.\nThere have been several instances in the past of shareholder activism targeted at some of our peers, as well as at other companies in the broader engineering and construction industry, with activists often seeking board representation and/or advocating for changes to the target company\u2019s operating structure or business strategy. Additionally, following periods of volatility in the market price of companies\u2019 securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against such companies.\nShareholder activism, which could take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing recently, and new universal proxy rules set to take effect later in 2022 could significantly lower the cost and further increase the ease and likelihood of shareholder activism. Volatility in our stock price or other reasons may in the future cause us to become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs, including significant legal fees and other expenses, and divert our management and Board of Directors\u2019 attention and resources from our business. Additionally, securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with customers and business partners, adversely affect our reputation, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Our stock price could also be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, there is no assurance that our policies and procedures will protect us from circumstances or actions that could result in possible criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdverse health events, such as an epidemic or a pandemic, could adversely impact our business.\nFrom time to time, various diseases have spread across the globe, such as the recent COVID-19. If a disease spreads sufficiently to cause an epidemic or a pandemic, our business or the business of our suppliers, subcontractors or customers could be adversely impacted.\nPhysical and regulatory risks related to climate change could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a business that builds new infrastructure and improves existing infrastructure for customers around the world, physical risks related to climate change, such as rising sea levels and temperatures, severe storms, and energy and technological disruptions, could cause delays and increases in project costs, resulting in variability in our revenue and profitability, as well as potentially adverse impacts to our operating results and financial condition. In addition, growing public concern about climate change has resulted in the increased focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues. Legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress and in the legislatures of various states in which we operate, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. Such policy changes, including any enactment of increasingly stringent emissions or other environmental regulations, could increase the costs of projects for us and for our clients and, in some cases, delay or even prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing demand for our services. Consequently, this could result in a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn connection with mergers and acquisitions, we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and adversely affect our operating results. Assessing whether impairment has occurred requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about the future, which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and if actual events turn out to be materially less favorable than the judgments we make and the assumptions we use, we may be required to record impairment charges in the future.\nWe had $255.6 million of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021. We assess these assets for impairment annually, or more often if required. Our assessments involve a number of estimates and assumptions that are inherently subjective, require significant judgment and involve highly uncertain matters that are subject to change. The use of different assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination as to whether or not an impairment has occurred. In addition, if future events are less favorable than what we assumed or estimated in our impairment analysis, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt agreements.\nWe currently have, and expect to continue to have, a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, our total debt was $1.0 billion, with $24.4 million classified as current debt. If we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or fail to comply with any of the other restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, an event of default could occur, causing the debt related to such agreements to become immediately due. If such acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay such indebtedness as required. Since indebtedness under our credit agreement entered into on August 18, 2020 (the \u201c2020 Credit Agreement\u201d) with BMO Harris Bank N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer and other lenders is secured by substantially all of our assets, acceleration of this debt could result in foreclosure of those assets and a negative impact on our operations. In addition, a failure to meet the terms of our 2020 Credit Agreement could result in a reduction of future borrowing capacity under the 2020 Credit Agreement, causing a loss of liquidity. A loss of liquidity could\nadversely impact our ability to execute projects in our backlog, obtain new projects, engage subcontractors, and attract and retain key employees.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s debt rating was downgraded by a major credit rating agency on March 23, 2020. The credit ratings assigned to us and our debt are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations. Negative changes in our credit ratings could also result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates with regard to any new or refinanced debt.\nRisk Related to Our Stock Ownership\nOur chairman and chief executive officer could exert influence over the Company due to his position and significant ownership interest.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our chairman and chief executive officer, Ronald N. Tutor, and three trusts controlled by Mr. Tutor (the \u201cTutor Group\u201d) owned approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Additionally, one of our current directors was appointed by Mr. Tutor pursuant to his right to nominate one member to our Board of Directors, so long as the Tutor Group owns at least 11.25% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Tutor could exert influence over the outcome of a range of corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval or rejection of other extraordinary transactions, such as a takeover attempt or sale of the Company or its assets.", "PERMNO": 50550, "SIC": 1540, "TIC": "TPC"}
