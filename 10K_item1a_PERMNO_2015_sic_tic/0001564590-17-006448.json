{"cik": "1650445", "company": "Quorum Health Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nOur company faces a variety of risks. Many of these risks are beyond our control and could cause our actual operating results and financial performance to be materially different from our expectations. Some of these risks are described below, including risks related to our business, the Spin-off, the U.S. healthcare industry, laws and regulations governing our industry, the securities markets and ownership of our common stock. Others risk factors, such as those related to our markets, operations, liquidity and interest rates, are described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d. If any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors or those contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and our shareholders could lose all or part of their investment. Furthermore, our actual operating and financial results may differ materially from those predicted in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures, including those summarized in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness, raise additional capital, finance operations and capital expenditures, pursue desirable business opportunities or successfully operate our business in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, was $1.3 billion.\nOur overall leverage, terms of our financing arrangements and debt service obligations could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital and capital expenditures, to fund growth or to fund general corporate purposes, even when necessary for us to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies were revised downward;\n\u2022\nsubject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our operating cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate expenditures;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industry in which we operate, and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and governmental regulations.\nOur ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in patient preferences, the success of responding to changing payment models and regulatory issues and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell our assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may be limited in our ability to pursue any of these options, if at all, in an instance of need, and any proceeds we receive may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations as due.\nOur senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, this variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements from us, which could adversely affect our available cash flow.\nThe agreements governing our debt, including our credit facilities and the indenture governing our Senior Notes, contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.\nThe agreements and indenture governing our credit facilities and Senior Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nborrow money or guarantee debt;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on, or redeem or repurchase our common stock;\n\u2022\nmake specified types of investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nsell assets or merge with other companies.\nIn addition, our credit facility contains restrictive covenants and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants and financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions.\nA default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the Senior Notes. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nAlso, in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes on April 22, 2016, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement that requires us to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the Senior Notes for a new issue of debt securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and cause the exchange offer to be completed by April 22, 2017, which is 365 days following the closing of the issuance of the Senior Notes. Although we intend to file a Form S-4 registration statement with respect to the offer to exchange prior to April 22, 2017, we may be unable to consummate the exchange offer of the Senior Notes by April 22, 2017, in which case, we will be required to pay additional interest to the holders of our Senior Notes.\nOur financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern.\nOn December 31, 2016, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (\u201cFASB\u2019) Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate if there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern is further discussed in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financial Outlook\u201d. On April 11, 2017, we amended our Senior Credit Facility (the \u201cCS Amendment\u201d) to, among other things, raise the maximum Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in our credit agreement (\u201cCS Agreement\u201d), among us, the lenders party thereto and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch (\u201cCredit Suisse\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent) to 4.75x from 4.25x for the period July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018 (which was previously 4.25x for the period July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018), at which point it drops to 4.00x for the remainder of the agreement. The CS Amendment also provides for additional Consolidated EBITDA add backs under the covenant calculation for certain items. Management has concluded that the CS Amendment alleviates any substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the one year period following the issuance of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. However, we cannot predict, with certainty, the outcome of our actions. Our ability to fund capital requirements, service our existing debt and comply with our debt covenants will depend on our future operating performance and will be impacted by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations or our operating performance does not comply with our amended debt covenants, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing indebtedness, sell assets, borrow additional money or raise equity. Breach of covenants included in our debt agreements, which could result in the lenders demanding payment of the unpaid principal and interest balances, would have an adverse effect upon our business and would likely require us to do any or all of the following: seek to renegotiate these debt arrangements with the lenders, seek waivers from the lenders, or seek to raise additional capital and increase revenues. If such negotiations and capital raising attempts proved unsuccessful, we may be required to seek protection from creditors through bankruptcy proceedings.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete for patients, local residents in the markets where we operate hospitals may choose to use other hospitals and healthcare providers for medical treatment.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients. The competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years. In most of our markets, which we generally define as the county where our hospital resides, we are the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services, which means we typically have less direct competition for our hospital services. Our hospitals face competition for patients from out-of-market hospitals, including hospitals in urban areas that may have more comprehensive specialty care service lines, more advanced medical equipment and technology, more extensive medical research capabilities and greater access to medical education programs. Patients who receive medical treatment from an out-of-market hospital may subsequently shift their preferences to that hospital for future healthcare services. We also face competition from other specialty care providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers that are not affiliated with us. Our hospitals and many of the hospitals with whom we compete engage in\nphysician alignment strategies, which may include employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups, participating in ACOs and, to the extent permitted by law, physician ownership of healthcare facilities.\nWe face competition from municipal and not-for-profit hospitals. In our markets where we are not the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services, our primary competitor is generally a not-for-profit hospital. Not-for-profit hospitals are typically owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities which are financially supported by endowments and charitable contributions. Not-for-profit hospitals do not pay income or property taxes and can make capital investments without paying sales tax. These financial advantages may better position such hospitals to maintain more modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment and to offer more specialized services than those available at our hospitals. If our competitors are better able to attract patients with these offerings, we may experience an overall decline in our patient volumes and operating revenues.\nOur ability to effectively compete for patients is impacted by commercial and managed care payor programs that influence patient choice related to both physicians and hospitals by offering health insurance plans that restrict patient choice of provider. For example, plans with narrow network structures restrict the number of participating in-network provider plans with tiered network structures impose higher cost-sharing obligations on patients that obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier. Trends toward increasing clinical transparency and value-based purchasing may have an adverse impact on our competitive position and patient volumes. Hospitals are required to publish their standard charges for healthcare items and services or their policy for allowing the public to review a list of their standard charges for healthcare services. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results on quality of care measures or patient satisfaction surveys in comparison to our competitors, or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, we may attract fewer patients.\nWe expect these competitive trends to continue. If we are unable to compete effectively with other healthcare providers, local residents may seek healthcare services from providers other than our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities.\nIf reimbursement rates paid by federal or state healthcare programs or commercial insurance and other managed care payors are reduced, if we are unable to maintain favorable contract terms with payors or comply with our payor contract obligations, if insured individuals move to insurance programs or plans with greater coverage exclusions or narrower networks, or if insurance coverage is otherwise restricted, our net operating revenues may decline.\nOur net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans, were 46.3%, 45.0% and 45.7% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and were 39.4%, 40.3% and 37.7% from managed care and commercial payors for these respective periods. Healthcare expenditures continue to increase and state governments continue to face budgetary shortfalls. As a result of such events and also pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, federal and state governments have made, and continue to make, significant changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including reductions in reimbursement payment levels and reductions to payments made to providers under state supplemental payment programs like DSH programs. Some of these changes have already decreased, and could further decrease in the future, the amount of payments we receive for our services.\nIn addition, governmental and commercial payors, as well as other third parties from whom we receive payment for our services, attempt to control healthcare costs by, for example, requiring hospitals to discount payments for their services in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plan networks, restricting coverage through utilization reviews, reducing coverage of inpatient services and shifting coverage of care to outpatient settings when possible, requiring prior authorizations for non-emergency services and implementing alternative payment models. The ability of commercial payors to control healthcare costs using these measures may be enhanced by the increasing consolidation of private health insurance companies and managed care companies. Furthermore, our contracts with payors require us to comply with a number of terms related to the provision of services and billing for services. If we are unable to negotiate increased reimbursement rates, maintain existing reimbursement rates or other favorable contract terms, effectively respond to payor cost controls or comply with the terms of our payor contracts, the payments we receive for our services may be reduced or we may be involved in disputes with payors and experience payment denials, both prospectively and retroactively. In addition, some individuals may move from existing coverage under health insurance plans with higher reimbursement rates for our services and lower co-payments and deductibles to plans, such as those purchased on the Exchanges, that may provide for lower reimbursement payments to us for our services along with higher co-payments and deductibles due from the patient or may even exclude our hospitals and employed physicians from coverage.\nIf we experience growth in self-pay revenues, or if we experience deterioration in the collectability of patient responsibility accounts, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe primary uncertainty in collectability of our revenues relates to uninsured patients and the patient financial responsibility portion of payments due from insured patients. Collections on account balances are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay, the effectiveness of CHS\u2019 collection efforts pursuant to our transition services agreements with them, and our own collection efforts. Significant changes in payor mix, centralized business office operations, in-market or overall U.S. economic conditions, or new and changing laws and regulations related to federal and state governmental healthcare coverage, among other things, could adversely impact our estimates of accounts receivable collectability. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Agreements with CHS Related to the Spin-off\u201d for additional information on the transition services agreements.\nIn recent years, our self-pay revenues have decreased, primarily due to the insurance expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In particular, we have experienced increasing numbers of individuals covered by Medicaid or commercial insurance plans. However, the results of the 2016 federal elections and associated efforts to repeal or revise the Affordable Care Act have caused uncertainty with regard to the future of the Affordable Care Act and its effects on the size of the uninsured population of U.S. citizens. Uncertainty regarding the number and identity of states that will ultimately expand their Medicaid programs and the number of uninsured U.S. citizens who elect to purchase health insurance, among other factors, also make it difficult to predict changes to the percentage of our revenues comprised of self-pay revenues. Even with increased rates of coverage, we may be adversely affected by the growth in the patient financial responsibility portion of payments for services which may result from ongoing changes in both governmental and non-governmental healthcare plans and programs, such as increased usage of healthcare savings accounts and more narrow or tiered network programs. Our ability to improve collections of our patient accounts may be limited by statutory, regulatory and investigatory initiatives, including private lawsuits directed at hospital charges and collection practices for uninsured and underinsured patients. In addition, a deterioration of economic conditions in the United States could lead to higher levels of uninsured patients, result in higher levels of patients covered by lower-paying governmental programs, result in fiscal uncertainties related to both governmental and non-governmental payors and could limit the economic ability of patients to make payments for which they are responsible. If we experience growth in self-pay revenues volume or deterioration in collectability of patient accounts, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the increase in reviews of claims filed for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, we may experience delayed payments or incur additional costs and may be required to repay amounts already paid to us under these programs.\nWe are subject to routine post-payment inquiries, investigations and audits of the claims we submit to Medicare and Medicaid for reimbursement payment for our healthcare services provided to covered patients. The number and parameters of claims subject to these post-payment reviews may increase as a result of federal and state governmental healthcare cost-containment initiatives, including enhanced medical necessity reviews for Medicare patients admitted as inpatients to hospitals for certain procedures. Furthermore, RACs utilize a post-payment targeted review process that employs data analysis techniques in order to identify Medicare and Medicaid claims most likely to contain overpayments, such as incorrectly coded services, short stay admissions, incorrect payment amounts, non-covered services and duplicate payments. The claims review strategies used by the RACs generally include a review of high dollar claims, including inpatient hospital claims. As a result, a large majority of the total payment adjustments determined by RACs relate to hospital claims. In addition, CMS employs MICs to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims to identify potential overpayments. State Medicaid agencies and other private third-party contractors have also increased their review activities. Third-party audits or investigations of Medicare or Medicaid claims could result in increases or decreases in our revenues to be recognized in periods subsequent to when the related healthcare services were performed, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nPayment recoveries resulting from post-payment reviews and denials are appealable. However, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. According to the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, the average processing time in fiscal year 2016 was nearly two and a half years. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nChanges to Medicaid supplemental payment programs may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nMedicaid state supplemental payments are payments made to providers separate from and in addition to those made under a state\u2019s standard Medicaid program. In addition, federal law requires state Medicaid programs to make DSH payments to hospitals that serve significant numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients. The Affordable Care Act requires reductions in Medicaid DSH payments through federal fiscal year 2025. Reductions in the funding of such programs could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nIn addition, supplemental payment programs are being reviewed by certain state agencies, and some states have made or may make waiver requests to CMS to replace existing supplemental payment programs. These reviews and waiver requests may result in restructuring of such programs and could cause reductions in or elimination of the payments. Currently, for example, supplemental Medicaid reimbursement programs in Texas offset some costs of providing uncompensated care and incentivize delivery system reform. CMS has approved an extension of the Texas Medicaid waiver through December 31, 2017, allowing Texas to continue receiving supplemental Medicaid reimbursement while expanding its managed Medicaid program. Texas has requested an additional extension of the waiver through September 30, 2019, but we cannot predict whether these Texas supplemental Medicaid reimbursement programs will continue.\nThe most recent phase of California\u2019s HQAF Program, which provides funding for non-federal supplemental payments to California hospitals that serve California\u2019s Medi-Cal and uninsured patients, expired on December 31, 2016. Although a state constitutional amendment indefinitely extended the program, we cannot recognize any HQAF revenues until CMS approves the next phase of the program. We are currently estimating the 2017 to 2019 HQAF Program will be approved in the fourth quarter of 2017 and that our revenues will be approximately $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, all of which will be recorded in the fourth quarter. We cannot provide any assurances of the amount of revenues our hospitals may receive from or the timing of CMS\u2019 approval of the 2017 to 2019 HQAF Program, the timing of the related cash flows, or that the program will be approved at all.\nA material portion of our revenues are concentrated in a single state which makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in that state.\nOur revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in the state of Illinois where we generate a significant portion of our patient revenues. We currently operate nine hospitals in Illinois, which collectively accounted for 35.1%, 35.3% and 37.3% of our net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Accordingly, any change in the current demographic, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions in this state could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Changes to the state Medicaid and other governmental payor programs in Illinois, including reductions in reimbursement rates or delays in timing of reimbursement payments, could also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to complete divestitures that are currently contemplated, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs noted above, we have been implementing a portfolio refinement strategy by divesting underperforming hospitals and outpatient service facilities. Generally, we believe these divestitures will allow us to reduce our corporate indebtedness and refine our hospital portfolio to a sustainable group of hospitals and outpatient service facilities with higher operating margins. However, there is no assurance that these contemplated divestitures will be completed, will be completed within our contemplated timeframe, or will be completed on terms favorable to us or on terms sufficient to allow us to achieve our strategy. Additionally, the results of operations for these hospitals we plan to divest and the potential gains or losses on the sales of those businesses may adversely affect our profitability. Moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability.\nIn addition, after entering into a definitive agreement, we may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the sale. Divestitures may also involve continued financial exposure related to the divested business, such as through indemnities or retained obligations, that present risk to us.\nOur planned divestiture activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks. Those risks include diversion of management attention from improving existing operations; additional restructuring charges and the related impact from separating personnel, renegotiating contracts, and restructuring financial and other systems; adverse effects on existing business relationships with patients and third-party payors; and the potential that the collectability of any patient accounts receivable retained from any divested hospital may be adversely impacted. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant decline in operating results or other indicators of impairment at one or more of our facilities could result in a material, non-cash charge to earnings to impair the value of long-lived assets.\nOur operations are capital intensive and require significant investment in long-lived assets, including property, equipment, software and other long-lived intangible assets. If one of hospitals or other healthcare facilities experiences declining operating results or is adversely impacted by one or more of the risk factors related to our business, we may not be able to recover the carrying value of those assets through our future operating cash flows. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate whether changes in future undiscounted cash flows reflect any potential impairment in the fair value of our long-lived assets. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded impairment charges of $166.9 million, $13.0 million and $1.0 million because of declining operating results and projections of future cash flows at certain of our hospitals. See Note 3 - Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill in the accompanying financial statements.\nIf the fair value of one or both of our reporting units declines, it could result in a material, non-cash charge to earnings from impairment of our goodwill.\nThe testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions related to our cost of capital and other factors impacting our fair value models. Future estimates of fair value could be adversely affected if the actual outcome of one or more of these assumptions changes materially in the future, including lower than expected hospital patient volumes, reduced reimbursement or increased operating costs. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate whether the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired when events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a total of $125.0 million of impairment to the goodwill associated with our hospital operations reporting unit. The impairment charge consisted of two components, a $5.0 million write-down of goodwill related to certain hospitals that we reclassified as held for sale in the second quarter of 2016 and $120.0 million of goodwill impairment resulting from a step two goodwill impairment evaluation as a result of certain indicators of impairment. The primary indicators were our declining market capitalization, as compared to the carrying value of equity, and a decrease in estimated future earnings.\nWe are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Affordable Care Act, and our business may be adversely affected if the Affordable Care Act is repealed entirely or if provisions benefitting our operations are significantly modified.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that increased access to health insurance. The most prominent of these efforts, the Affordable Care Act, affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed. As currently structured, the Affordable Care Act mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage, expands health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms, reduces Medicare reimbursement to hospitals, and promotes value-based purchasing. There are currently several public and private initiatives that aim to transition payment models from passive volume-based reimbursement to models that are tied to the quality and value of services.\nThe 2016 federal elections resulted in a new administration that, along with certain members of Congress, has stated its intent to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation and/or its interpretation. There is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the Affordable Care Act will be changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, the timing of enactment and implementation of alternative provisions, and the impact of alternative provisions on providers as well as other healthcare industry participants. In addition, a presidential executive order has been signed that directs agencies to minimize \u201ceconomic and regulatory burdens\u201d of the Affordable Care Act, but it is unclear how this will be implemented. Further, Congress could eliminate or alter provisions beneficial to us while leaving in place provisions reducing our reimbursement. Government efforts to repeal or change the Affordable Care Act may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.\nIf competition decreases our ability to acquire additional hospitals on favorable terms, we may be unable to execute our acquisition strategy.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to acquire additional hospitals. However, not-for-profit hospital systems and other for-profit hospital companies generally attempt to acquire the same type of hospitals as we do. Some of our competitors for acquisitions have greater financial resources than we have. Furthermore, some hospitals are sold through an auction process, which may result in higher purchase prices than we believe are reasonable. Therefore, we may not be able to acquire additional hospitals on terms favorable to us.\nIf we fail to improve the financial and operating performance of acquired and existing hospitals, we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy.\nWhile we do not intend to acquire hospitals that are not accretive to our net operating revenues, it is possible that one or more hospitals we acquire may have lower operating margins than we do or have incurred operating losses prior to the time we acquire them. We may occasionally experience delays in improving the operating margins or effectively integrating the operations of acquired hospitals. Some of our existing hospitals are experiencing lower operating margins than other hospitals in our portfolio. In the future, if we are unable to improve the operating margins of these existing hospitals or any acquired hospitals, operate them profitably or effectively integrate their operations, as applicable, we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy. To the extent that our operating margins were to decline as a result of financial and operating performance at our hospitals, we could be unable to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreements or be limited or precluded from obtaining future borrowings by the terms of our credit agreements and the indenture governing our Senior Notes.\nThe failure or downsizing of large employers, or the closure of manufacturing or other major facilities in our markets, could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.\nThe economies in the markets in which most of our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers, especially manufacturing or other major facilities. These employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and outpatient service facilities for their medical care. The failure of one or more large employers, or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at manufacturing or other facilities located in or near the markets in which we operate hospitals, could cause affected residents to move elsewhere for employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them. The occurrence of these events may cause a reduction in our revenues and adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of operational, legal and financial risks associated with outsourcing functions to third parties.\nWe have outsourced to CHS, through various transition services agreements, certain services including, among others, services related to information technology, payroll processing and other human resources functions, patient eligibility screening, receivables, billing and collections and other revenue management services and support. We take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of any parties in which we delegate services; however, the transition services agreements with CHS were executed in connection with the Spin-off, based upon certain business and financial assumptions. To the extent that any of the transition services agreements are determined not to benefit us in their current form, our ability to renegotiate, rescind or reform any or all of the agreements may be limited or non-existent, and our business could be adversely affected.\nArrangements with third-party service providers may make our operations vulnerable if these vendors fail to satisfy their obligations to us as a result of their performance, changes in their own operations, financial condition or other matters outside of our control. We may also face legal, financial or reputational harm for the actions or omissions of such providers, and we may not have effective recourse against the providers. Effective management, development and implementation of our outsourcing strategies are important to our business strategy. If there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes or our third-party service providers do not perform as anticipated, we may not be able to fully realize on a timely basis the anticipated economic and other benefits of the outsourcing services or other relationships we enter into with key vendors, which could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention from other strategic activities, negatively affect employee morale or create other operational or financial problems for us. Terminating or transitioning arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs and a risk of operational delays, potential errors and possible control issues during the termination and transition processes, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe failure to obtain our medical supplies and drugs at favorable prices could cause our operating results to be adversely affected.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we renegotiated and entered into a separate participation agreement with the group purchasing organization GPO that we used prior to the Spin-off date. GPOs attempt to obtain favorable pricing on medical supplies and drugs with manufacturers and vendors, sometimes by negotiating exclusive supply arrangements in exchange for discounts. To the extent these exclusive supply arrangements are challenged or deemed unenforceable, we could incur higher costs than anticipated for our medical supplies obtained through the GPO. Also, there can be no assurance that our arrangement with the GPO will provide the expected discounts on a long-term basis. Furthermore, costs of medical supplies and drugs may continue to increase due to market pressure from pharmaceutical companies and new product drug releases. Higher costs could cause our operating results to be adversely affected.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease in the markets in which we operate hospitals, or which otherwise impacts our healthcare facilities, could adversely impact our business.\nIf a pandemic or other public health crisis were to affect any or all of the markets in which we operate hospitals, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Such a crisis could diminish the public\u2019s trust in healthcare facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose or that are treating or have treated patients affected by contagious diseases. If any of our healthcare facilities were involved in treating patients for such a contagious disease, other patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care from our healthcare facilities. Further, a pandemic might adversely impact our business by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our healthcare facilities. Although we have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, the potential impact of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease, with respect to our markets or our healthcare facilities is difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business.\nOur performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.\nAlthough we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of the healthcare facilities at which they practice. The success of our healthcare facilities depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities, our ability to employ or contract with quality physicians, the admitting and utilization practices of employed and non-employee physicians, maintaining good relations with physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. In many of the markets we serve, many physicians have admitting privileges at other healthcare facilities in addition to our healthcare facilities. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation or employment with our healthcare facilities at any time. If we are unable to provide adequate supporting medical staff or technologically advanced medical equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.\nOur labor costs could be adversely affected by competition for medical staff, a shortage of experienced nurses and labor union activity.\nIn addition to our physicians, the operations of our hospitals are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our hospital management teams and other medical staff, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and medical staff responsible for the daily operations of our hospitals. In some markets across the United States, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue for healthcare providers. We may be required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract medical staff. In addition, some states have, and others could adopt, mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues at hospitals where admissions must be limited in order to meet the required ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,400 employees, including approximately 1,600 part-time employees, at our nine hospitals represented by labor unions. Increased or ongoing labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our\nlabor costs or otherwise adversely impact us. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our labor costs could increase significantly. In addition, when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operations during any strike periods could increase our labor costs and otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIf our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise the standard charges for our healthcare services to offset these increased costs. Additionally, a significant portion of our revenues are subject to fixed reimbursement rates, which constrains our ability to pass along the impact of these increased costs to the patient or other third-party payors. In the event we are not effective at recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical staff, or we are unable to control our labor costs in relation to certain events and circumstances, the increase in our labor costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur hospitals and other healthcare facilities may be negatively impacted by severe weather, earthquakes and other factors beyond our control, which could restrict patient access to care or cause one or more of our facilities to close temporarily.\nThe results of operations of our hospitals and outpatient service facilities may be adversely impacted by severe weather conditions, including earthquakes, hurricanes and widespread winter storms, or other factors beyond our control that could cause disruption to patient scheduling or displacement of our patients, employees, physicians and clinical staff, and may force certain of our facilities to close temporarily. In certain geographic areas, we have a concentration of hospitals and outpatient service facilities that may be simultaneously affected by adverse weather conditions or events. These types of disruptions due to severe weather could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf our adoption and utilization of electronic health record systems fails to achieve the required measures for meaningful use, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the HITECH Act, eligible hospitals and healthcare professionals can receive incentive payments for their adoption and meaningful use of certified EHR technology. Those that fail to demonstrate meaningful use are subject to Medicare payment reductions. The implementation of EHR technology that meets the meaningful use criteria of the HITECH Act requires a significant capital investment, and we have and intend to continue to offset some of these costs by maximizing our receipt of incentive payments. EHR incentive payments are subject to audit and potential recoupment if it is determined that the applicable meaningful use standards were not met and are also subject to retrospective adjustment because the annual cost report data upon which the incentive payments are based are further subject to audit. If our hospitals and healthcare professionals are unable to comply with the meaningful use standards, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing EHR systems, and we could be subject to penalties that may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We expect our EHR incentive payments earned will be approximately $5 million for 2017.\nIf there are delays in regulatory updates by governmental agencies to federal and state healthcare programs, we may experience increased volatility in our operating results as such delays may result in a timing difference between when such program revenues are earned and when they become known or estimable for purposes of accounting recognition.\nOur net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans, were 46.3%, 45.0% and 45.7% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The reimbursement payments related to these programs are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory changes that can have a significant impact on our operating results. When delays occur in the passage of legislation or the implementation of regulations, we could experience material increases or decreases in our revenues to be recognized in periods subsequent to when the related healthcare services were performed. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded net favorable (unfavorable) contractual allowance adjustments in net operating revenues of $(5.8) million, $(15.1) million and $9.2 million, respectively, related to previous program reimbursement estimates and final cost report settlements. The volatility in the timing of recognition as revenues of adjustments to reimbursement payments under these programs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nControls designed by third-party payors to reduce utilization of inpatient services may reduce our revenues.\nOver the last several years, third-party payors, including both governmental and non-governmental payors, have instituted policies and procedures to substantially reduce or limit coverage of inpatient healthcare services. Payors have implemented controls and procedures designed to monitor and reduce patient admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as \u201cutilization review,\u201d which have impacted and are expected to continue to impact inpatient admission volumes at our hospitals. Federal laws contain numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and hospital occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required pre-admission authorization requirements, payor-required post-admission utilization reviews and payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative delivery options for healthcare services for less acutely ill patients. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates by governmental and non-governmental third-party payors could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive laws and governmental regulations that apply to the U.S. healthcare industry, including anti-fraud and abuse laws, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is governed by extensive laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels. These laws and regulations include standards that address, among other issues, the following:\n\u2022\nthe adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nbilling and coding for services;\n\u2022\nproper handling of overpayments;\n\u2022\nclassification of levels of care provided;\n\u2022\npreparing and filing of cost reports;\n\u2022\nrelationships with referral sources and referral recipients;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of adequate records;\n\u2022\ncompliance with building codes;\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection; and\n\u2022\nprivacy and security.\nExamples of these laws include, but are not limited to, HIPAA, the Stark Law, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, EMTALA and similar state laws. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil sanctions and criminal penalties, including the loss of our operating licenses and our ability to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. There are heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state governmental agencies relating to the U.S. healthcare industry. Recent enforcement actions have focused on financial arrangements between hospitals and physicians, billing for services without adequately documenting medical necessity and billing for services outside the coverage guidelines for such services. Specific to our hospitals, we have received inquiries and subpoenas from various governmental agencies regarding these and other matters, and we are also subject to various claims and lawsuits relating to such matters. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for a further discussion of these matters.\nIn the future, evolving interpretations or enforcement of the laws and regulations applicable to the U.S. healthcare industry could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes to our healthcare facilities, equipment, personnel, healthcare service offerings, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.\nWe could be subject to increased monetary penalties and other sanctions, including exclusion from federal healthcare programs, if we fail to comply with the terms of the Corporate Integrity Agreement.\nOn August 4, 2014, CHS became subject to the terms of a five-year CIA with the OIG arising from a civil settlement with the DOJ, other federal agencies and identified relators that concluded previously announced investigations and litigation related to short stay admissions through emergency departments at certain of their hospitals. The OIG has required us to be bound by the terms of the CHS CIA commencing on the Spin-off date and applying to us for the remainder of the five-year compliance term required of CHS, which terminates on August 4, 2019. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for additional information on the terms of the CIA.\nMaterial, uncorrected violations of the CIA could lead to our suspension or disbarment from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs and subject us to repayment obligations. In addition, we are subject to possible civil penalties for failure to substantially comply with the terms of the CIA, including stipulated penalties ranging between $1,000 and $2,500 per day. We are also subject to a stipulated penalty of $50,000 for each false certification made by us or on our behalf, pursuant to the reporting provisions of the CIA. The CIA increases the amount of information we must provide to the federal government regarding our practices at our healthcare facilities and our compliance with federal regulations. The reports we provide in connection with the CIA could result in greater scrutiny by other regulatory agencies.\nWe may be adversely affected by consolidation among health insurance providers.\nIn recent years, a number of private health insurance providers have merged or increased efforts to consolidate with other non-governmental payors as a result, in part, of medical loss ratio (\u201cMLR\u201d) requirements that were established by the Affordable Care Act. The MLR represents the percentage of premiums used to pay patient medical claims and used for programs or activities that improve the quality of patient care. Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurance providers that do not meet minimum MLR requirements must pay premium rebates on group and individual health insurance plan products and, for certain Medicare program products, may be subject to additional penalties. Our ability to negotiate prices and favorable terms with health insurance providers could be negatively impacted by their efforts to satisfy the MLR requirements. In addition, the trend within the U.S. healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing programs could be accelerated if the large private health insurance companies, including those engaging in consolidation activity, find these programs to be financially beneficial. We cannot predict whether we will be able to respond effectively to the impact of increased consolidation within the payor industry.\nWe may from time to time become the subject of legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings that, if resolved unfavorably, could have an adverse effect on us, and we may be subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown.\nWe may from time to time become a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters. Those proceedings include, among other things, governmental investigations. In addition, we may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. Addressing any investigations, lawsuits or other claims may distract management and divert resources, even if we ultimately prevail. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of any such current or future legal, regulatory or governmental proceedings or other such loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future, there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nFor example, on September 9, 2016, a shareholder filed a purported class action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against our company and certain of our officers. The amended complaint purports to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of all persons (other than defendants) who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of our company between May 2, 2016 and August 10, 2016 and alleges that our company and certain of our officers violated federal securities laws, including Sections 10(b) and/or 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by making alleged false and/or misleading statements and failing to disclose certain information regarding aspects of our business, operations and compliance policies in the Spin-off registration statement and in subsequent disclosures. Defending ourselves against these allegations or other shareholder activities, activism or lawsuits and any related publicity could potentially entail significant costs and could require significant attention from our management. We are unable to predict the outcome of this matter. However, it is reasonably possible that we may incur a loss in connection with this matter. We are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of such reasonably possible loss. Under some circumstances, any losses incurred in connection with adverse outcomes in this matter could be material.\nGovernmental investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to significant fines, penalties, settlements or other sanctions, including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs. Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. While CHS has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities relating to outcomes or events occurring prior to the closing of the Spin-off, we cannot guarantee that any such legal proceedings or loss contingencies will be covered by such indemnities or that CHS will fully indemnify us thereunder. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for additional information on legal proceedings to which we are subject.\nIf we become subject to significant legal actions, we could be subject to substantial uninsured liabilities or increased insurance costs.\nPhysicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice and other liability claims or legal theories. Even in states that have imposed caps on damage awards, plaintiffs are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages. Many of these actions involve large claims and significant costs for legal defense. To protect us from the vulnerability to the potentially significant costs arising from these claims, we maintain claims-made professional and general liability insurance coverage in excess of those amounts for which we are self-insured. We believe the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient to cover potential losses of our operations. Our insurance coverage, however, may not continue to be available in the future at a reasonable cost for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance. Additionally, our insurance coverage does not cover all claims against us, such as fines, penalties, or other damage and legal expense payments resulting from qui tam lawsuits. Although CHS has agreed to indemnify us for certain legal proceedings and our loss contingencies relating to outcomes or events occurring prior to the closing of the Spin-off, we cannot guarantee that any such legal proceedings or loss contingencies will be covered by such indemnities or that CHS will fully indemnify us thereunder.\nOur operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems.\nOur information systems are critical to our business operations. We entered into various transition services agreements with CHS that began immediately following the spin-off date and define agreed upon services to be provided by CHS to us, as specified by each agreement. The transition services agreements generally have terms of five years and include, among others, services related to information technology, payroll processing, certain human resources functions, patient eligibility screening, billing, collections and other revenue management services. The majority of our information systems are managed by CHS under the terms of these agreements. In general, information systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. We believe that CHS takes precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our business operations as a result of failure or disruption to their information systems. It is possible that we may be impacted by information system failures. The occurrence of any information system failures could result in interruptions, delays, loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of these systems. All of these events or circumstances, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and they could harm our business reputation.\nA cyber-attack or security breach could cause a loss of confidential patient data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law or other legal theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage clinical and financial data, to communicate with our patients, payors, vendors and other third parties, and to summarize and analyze our operating results. We have made significant investments in technology to protect our systems and information from cyber-security risks. During the second quarter of 2014, the computer network of CHS was the target of an external, criminal cyber-attack in which the attacker successfully copied and transferred certain data outside CHS. This data included certain non-medical patient identification data (such as patient names, addresses, birthdates, telephone numbers and social security numbers) considered protected under HIPAA, but did not include patient credit card, medical or clinical information. The remediation efforts in response to the attack were substantial, including continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access.\nIn spite of our policies, procedures and other security measures used to protect our computer systems and data, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future. Such attacks or breaches could result in loss of protected patient medical data or other information subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information technology systems or business. We continue to prioritize cyber-security and the development of practices and controls to protect our systems and data. As cyber-threats evolve, we may be required to invest in significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. If we are subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future, this could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.\nThe trend toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services is gaining momentum across the U.S. healthcare industry among both governmental and commercial payors. Generally, value-based purchasing initiatives tie reimbursement payments to the quality and efficiency of patient care. For example, hospitals that fall into the lowest-performing 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year are subject to a 1% reduction in their total Medicare reimbursement payments. Further, hospitals do not receive Medicare reimbursement payments for care related to HACs. In addition, HHS reduces Medicare inpatient hospital reimbursement payments for all discharges by a required percentage, set at 2% for federal fiscal year 2017 and for subsequent years, and pools the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards. Hospitals are also required to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates under both the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nHHS has indicated that it is particularly focused on tying Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models, which generally aim to make providers attentive to the quality and cost of care they deliver to patients. Examples of alternative payment models include ACOs and bundled payment arrangements. In 2016, HHS established bundled payment programs for specified cardiac and orthopedic procedures that are mandatory for hospitals located in certain geographic areas. HHS may establish other mandatory programs. It is unclear whether alternative payment models will successfully lead to increased coordination of care and cost containment, or whether they will decrease the aggregate reimbursements under federal and state healthcare programs.\nSeveral of the largest commercial insurance payors in the United States have also expressed the intent to increase reliance on value-based purchasing. Furthermore, many large commercial insurance payors require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.\nWe expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement rates on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement payment amounts under both governmental and non-governmental programs and plans. We are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues, operating costs, or both.\nCertificate of need laws and regulations regarding licenses, ownership and operation may impair our future expansion or divestiture opportunities in some states. In states without certificate of need laws, our providers may face lower barriers to entry, but could also face increased competition from other providers.\nSome states require prior approval for the purchase, construction and expansion of healthcare facilities based on the state\u2019s determination of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. In addition, certain states in which we operate hospitals require a CON for, among other things, capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount and changes in bed capacity or healthcare service lines. We may not be able to obtain CONs required for expansion activities that we want to pursue in the future. In addition, we are required to maintain one or more licenses in all of the states in which we operate hospitals. If we fail to obtain a required CON or license, our ability to operate or expand our operations in those states could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if a CON or other prior approval upon which we relied to invest in construction of a replacement or expanded healthcare facility were to be revoked or lost through an appeal process, we may not be able to recover the value of our investment.\nSome states in which we operate do not require CONs for the purchase, construction and expansion of healthcare facilities or services. Additionally, from time to time, states with existing requirements may repeal or limit the scope of their CON programs for\nfuture entry. In these cases, our competing healthcare providers could face lower barriers to entry and expansion into certain states where we operate hospitals. We could face decreased market share and revenues if competing healthcare providers are able to purchase, construct or expand healthcare facilities, without being subject to regulatory approval, into markets that are in close proximity to those in which we operate hospitals.\nIf we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.\nHospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations. Although we plan to generally seek, indemnification from sellers covering these matters, we may nevertheless have material liabilities for past activities of acquired hospitals.\nState efforts to regulate the sale of hospitals operated by municipal or not-for-profit entities could prevent us from acquiring these types of hospitals and executing on our business strategy.\nMany states have adopted legislation regarding the sale or other disposition of hospitals operated by municipalities or not-for-profit entities. In some states that do not have specific legislation, the attorneys general have demonstrated an interest in these transactions under their general obligation to protect the use of charitable assets. These legislative and administrative efforts focus primarily on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non-profit seller. The review and, in some instances, approval processes can add additional time to the closing of a hospital acquisition. In addition, future state actions could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire these types of hospitals.\nQuorum Health Resources, while subject to various risk factors affecting its hospital industry clients, is subject to additional risks related to its unique business model.\nThe various risk factors stated herein that could result in adverse impacts on the results of operations of our hospitals could similarly affect the hospital and other healthcare clients of our QHR business. Any negative impact on our QHR clients could result in defaults under or terminations of one or more of our contracts, or could result in our inability to attract new management advisory and consulting business. Furthermore, QHR could be subject to allegations of mismanagement, as well as assertions of participation in incidents of alleged malpractice in its position as a management advisor to certain hospital clients. It is possible that resolutions of these actions could require settlements from us that exceed the revenues received from the related hospital client, and this could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off and Our Operations as an Independent Publicly Traded Company\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expected to achieve from the Spin-off.\nAs an independent, publicly traded company, we believe that our business will benefit from, among other things, the elimination of internal competition with CHS\u2019 network of larger hospitals for capital, key management and other resources, the tailored business strategy that we have developed for our company that focuses on building market share in the hospital markets we serve, the profitability and operational performance of our hospitals, strategic considerations of divestiture candidates and potential buyers for underperforming hospitals, the optimization of selective acquisition opportunities that will be unique to us, and the development of performance-based incentive programs for our management teams that align rewards with success in our business objectives and opportunities. It is possible that we may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nBeginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017, we will be required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm as to whether we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of the last day of the year. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources.\nEffective as of the Spin-off date, we became subject to the Exchange Act, which requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To comply with both of these requirements, we may need to upgrade our accounting and information systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, or hire additional accounting and finance staff. We expect to incur additional annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these requirements, and those expenses may be significant. If we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective manner, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules to which we are now subject under the Exchange Act could become impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nThe utilization of our federal income tax loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we generated a federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforward of approximately $70.0 million on a pre-tax basis available to offset future taxable income. This NOL carryforward will begin to expire in 2037. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of a company\u2019s taxable income that may be offset by the NOL carryforwards if it experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when a company\u2019s \u201cfive-percent shareholders,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code collectively increase their ownership in a company by more than 50 percentage points, by value, over a rolling three-year period. This is different from a change in beneficial ownership under applicable securities laws. These ownership changes include purchases of common stock under share repurchase programs, a company\u2019s offering of its stock, the purchase or sale of company stock by five-percent shareholders, or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire company stock. While we expect to be able to realize our total NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, if an ownership change occurs, our ability to use the NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation and will depend on the amount of taxable income we generate in future periods. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the NOL carryforwards. Furthermore, we could be required to record a valuation allowance related to the amount of the NOL carryforwards that may not be realized, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe utilization of our state income tax loss carryforwards could be limited if we do not realize profits from our hospital operations to adequately offset these losses in the applicable states where they exist.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had state income tax loss carryforwards of $635.1 million. We expect to be able to realize a small amount of our NOL carryforwards in certain states prior to their expiration. In other states where we hope to improve our financial performance through selective profitable acquisitions of hospitals or, when needed, the divestiture of underperforming hospitals, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to fully realize the tax benefit associated with these state NOL carryforwards. As a result, we have recorded a valuation allowance to offset all or a portion of the deferred tax asset created by the NOL carryforwards in those states. We could be required to record additional valuation allowance related to our state NOL carryforwards based upon our operating results in the future, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe Spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nThe Spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that the Spin-off left CHS insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that CHS intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature and that CHS did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the Spin-off. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the Spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, returning our assets or your shares in our company to CHS, voiding our liens and claims against CHS, or providing CHS with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by CHS and the fair market value of our company at the time of the Spin-off.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if either the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), or it is unlikely to be able to pay its liabilities as they become due. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that CHS was solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-off, including the distribution of our common stock.\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement with CHS, from and after the Spin-off, we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to our business. Although we do not expect to be liable for any of these or other obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, it is possible that we could be required to assume responsibility for certain obligations retained by CHS should CHS fail to pay or perform its retained obligations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws, among other things, authorize our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) to issue one or more series of preferred stock, prohibit our shareholders from calling a special meeting of shareholders and provide that Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of legal proceedings initiated by our shareholders. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board, including discouraging takeover attempts that could have resulted in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement, we are required not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition of our common stock, issuance of our common stock or any other transaction or, to the extent we have the right to prohibit it, to permit any such transaction, that could cause the distribution of our common stock to CHS shareholders to be taxable. We also agreed to indemnify CHS for any tax resulting from any such transactions. Generally, CHS will recognize taxable gain on the distribution of our common stock if there are one or more acquisitions or issuances of our common stock, directly or indirectly, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of our then-outstanding common stock, and the acquisition or issuance is deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution of common stock to CHS shareholders. Any such shares of our common stock acquired, directly or indirectly, within two years before or after the Spin-off date, with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances, will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. As a result, our obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.\nWe do not plan to pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nWe do not currently plan to pay a regular dividend on our common stock. The declaration of any future cash dividends and, if declared, the amount of any such dividends will be subject to our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, financial covenants and other contractual restrictions and to the discretion of our Board. Our Board may take into account such matters as general business conditions, industry practice, our financial condition and performance, our future prospects, our cash needs and capital investment plans, income tax consequences, applicable law and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividend if we do commence the payment of dividends.\nThe percentage ownership in our common stock of each shareholder may become diluted in the future.\nAs with any public company, the percentage ownership of our company held by an individual shareholder may become diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or equity awards, which we may grant to officers, directors and certain of our employees. From time to time, we will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.", "PERMNO": 16004, "SIC": 8062, "TIC": "QHCCQ"}
