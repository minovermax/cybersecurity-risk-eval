{"cik": "1389050", "company": "EXTERRAN HOLDINGS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAs described in Part I (\u201cDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d), this report contains forward-looking statements regarding us, our business and our industry. The risk factors described below, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nContinued low oil and natural gas prices could decrease demand or pricing for our natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment and services and, as a result, adversely affect our business.\nOur results of operations depend upon the level of activity in the global energy market, including oil and natural gas development, production, processing and transportation. Oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity can be volatile. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a sustained reduction in oil or natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets. Even the perception of longer-term lower oil or natural gas prices by oil and natural gas exploration, development and production companies can result in their decision to cancel, reduce or postpone major expenditures or to reduce or shut in well production. In April 2012, natural gas prices in North America fell to their lowest levels in more than a decade with the Henry Hub spot price at around $2.00 per MMBtu. As a result, certain companies reduced their natural gas drilling and production activities, particularly in more mature and predominantly dry gas areas in North America, where we provide a significant amount of contract operations services, which led to a decline in our contract operations business in these areas during 2012. Since then, natural gas prices in North America improved somewhat and generally were near or above $4.00 per MMBtu for much of 2014, but natural gas prices in 2014 continued to cause certain companies to reduce their natural gas drilling and production activities in more mature and predominantly dry gas areas in North America, which led to a continued decline in our contract operations business in these areas in 2014. Global oil prices have fallen significantly recently. West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot prices as of December 31, 2014 were approximately 41% and 46% lower than prices at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, which is expected to lead to reduced drilling of oil wells in 2015. Because we provide a significant amount of contract operations services related to the production of associated gas from oil wells and a significant amount of contract operations services related to the use of gas lift to enhance production of oil from oil wells, our operations and our levels of operating horsepower are also impacted by crude oil drilling and production activity. In addition, the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was approximately $3.10 per MMBtu at December 31, 2014, which was approximately 24% and 27% lower than prices at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, and the U.S. natural gas liquid composite price was approximately $7.84 per MMBtu for the month of November 2014, which was approximately 20% and 27% lower than prices for the months of September 2014 and December 2013, respectively, which is expected to lead to reduced drilling of gas wells in North America in 2015. If oil or natural gas production growth moderates or declines in North America or other parts of the world, the level of production activity and the demand for our contract operations services and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A reduction in demand for our products and services could also force us to reduce our pricing substantially, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, a reduction in demand for our products and services could result in our customers seeking to preserve capital by canceling month-to-month contracts, canceling or delaying scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment, determining not to enter into new contract operations service contracts or purchase new compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment, or canceling or delaying orders for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, in North America, compression services for unconventional natural gas sources constitute an increasing percentage of our business. Some of these unconventional sources are less economic to produce in lower natural gas price environments.\nThe proposed Spinoff of our international contract operations, international aftermarket services and global fabrication businesses is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, may require significant time and attention of our management, may not achieve the intended results, and difficulties in connection with the Spinoff could have an adverse effect on us.\nAs previously disclosed, our board of directors has approved a plan to reorganize our business by means of a Spinoff of our international contract operations, international aftermarket services and global fabrication businesses. For more information see \u201cProposed Spinoff Transaction\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this report. The Spinoff is contingent upon the final approval of our board of directors and other conditions, some of which are beyond our control. For this and other reasons, the Spinoff may not be completed in the expected timeframe or at all. Additionally, execution of the proposed Spinoff will continue to require significant expense and time and attention of our management. The Spinoff could distract management from the operation of our business and the execution of our other strategic initiatives. Our employees may also be uncertain about their future roles within the separate companies pending the completion of the Spinoff, which could lead to departures. Further, if the Spinoff is completed, we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize. Any such difficulties could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If completed, the Spinoff may also expose us to certain risks that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe proposed Spinoff of our international contract operations, international aftermarket services and global fabrication businesses could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.\nHistorically, companies seeking to perform a tax-free spinoff transaction have been able to seek broad private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) that the proposed spinoff transaction would qualify for tax-free treatment, with the exception of certain issues on which the IRS would not rule. However, in 2013 the IRS announced that it would no longer provide such broad advance rulings but would instead rule only on certain \u201csignificant issues.\u201d We have not requested a ruling from the IRS regarding the Spinoff of our international contract operations, international aftermarket services and global fabrication businesses. Prior to completing the Spinoff, we expect to receive an opinion of counsel that the Spinoff should qualify as reorganization under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and, as a result, neither we nor our stockholders should recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Spinoff. However, this opinion will not be binding on the IRS or any court. Accordingly, the IRS or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the Spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel. If the Spinoff and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable to us, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if the Spinoff were taxable to our stockholders, each holder of our common stock who receives shares of Spinco would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.\nThere are many risks associated with conducting operations in international markets.\nWe operate in many countries outside the U.S., and these activities accounted for a substantial amount of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014. We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries where we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, as discussed in Note 3 to the Financial Statements, in 2009, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (\u201cPDVSA\u201d), assumed control over substantially all of our assets and operations in Venezuela.\nIn April 2012, Argentina assumed control over its largest oil and gas producer, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (\u201cYPF\u201d). We had approximately 523,000 horsepower of compression in Argentina as of December 31, 2014, and we generated $172.5 million of revenue in Argentina, including $78.5 million of revenue from YPF, during the year ended December 31, 2014. We are unable to predict what effect, if any, the nationalization of YPF will have on our business in Argentina, or whether Argentina will nationalize additional businesses in the oil and gas industry; however, the nationalization of YPF, the nationalization of additional businesses or the taking of other actions listed below by Argentina could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMore generally in Argentina, the ongoing social, political, economic and legal climate has given rise to significant uncertainties about the country\u2019s economic and political future. Since the presidential election in late 2011, the Argentine government has increasingly used foreign-exchange, price, trade and capital controls to attempt to address the country\u2019s economic challenges. Because Argentina\u2019s current regulations restrict foreign exchange, including exchanging Argentine pesos for U.S. dollars in certain cases, we are unable to freely repatriate earnings from Argentina and therefore the cash flow from our operations in Argentina may not be a reliable source of funding for our operations outside of Argentina, which could limit our ability to grow. In addition, our inability to exchange Argentine pesos for U.S. dollars subjects us to risk of currency devaluation on future earnings in Argentina. During 2014, we used Argentine pesos to purchase certain short-term investments in Argentine government issued U.S. dollar denominated bonds. The effective peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate embedded in the purchase price of these bonds resulted in our recognition of a loss during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $6.5 million, which is included in other (income) expense, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIn addition, the Argentine government may adopt additional regulations or policies in the future that may impact, among other things, (i) the timing of and our ability to repatriate cash from Argentina to the U.S. and other jurisdictions, (ii) the value of our assets and business in Argentina and (iii) our ability to import into Argentina the materials necessary for our operations. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operations in Argentina.\nWith respect to any particular country in which we operate, the risks inherent in our activities may include the following, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows:\n\u00b7 difficulties in managing international operations, including our ability to timely and cost effectively execute projects;\n\u00b7 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, laws or policies by foreign agencies or governments;\n\u00b7 work stoppages;\n\u00b7 training and retaining qualified personnel in international markets;\n\u00b7 the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u00b7 actions by governments or national oil companies that result in the nullification or renegotiation on less than favorable terms of existing contracts, or otherwise result in the deprivation of contractual rights, and other difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations;\n\u00b7 governmental actions that result in restricting the movement of property or that impede our ability to import or export parts or equipment;\n\u00b7 foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the risk of currency devaluations by foreign governments;\n\u00b7 difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 potentially longer receipt of payment cycles;\n\u00b7 changes in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, including general political unrest, the nationalization of energy related assets, civil uprisings, riots, kidnappings, violence associated with drug cartels and terrorist acts;\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences or tax law changes;\n\u00b7 currency controls or restrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7 expropriation, confiscation or nationalization of property without fair compensation;\n\u00b7 the risk that our international customers may have reduced access to credit because of higher interest rates, reduced bank lending or a deterioration in our customers\u2019 or their lenders\u2019 financial condition;\n\u00b7 complications associated with installing, operating and repairing equipment in remote locations;\n\u00b7 limitations on insurance coverage;\n\u00b7 inflation;\n\u00b7 the geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences among personnel in different areas of the world; and\n\u00b7 difficulties in establishing new international offices and the risks inherent in establishing new relationships in foreign countries.\nIn addition, we may expand our business in international markets where we have not previously conducted business. The risks inherent in establishing new business ventures, especially in international markets where local customs, laws and business procedures present special challenges, may affect our ability to be successful in these ventures or avoid losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are due to receive a substantial amount in installment payments from the purchaser of our previously nationalized Venezuelan assets, the nonpayment of which would reduce the anticipated amount of funds available to us to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.\nAs discussed in Notes 3 and 9 to the Financial Statements, in March 2012 and August 2012, we sold our previously-nationalized Venezuelan joint venture assets and Venezuelan subsidiary assets, respectively, to PDVSA Gas, S.A. (\u201cPDVSA Gas\u201d), a subsidiary of PDVSA, for aggregate consideration of approximately $550 million. As of December 31, 2014, we have received payments, including annual charges, of approximately $421 million ($50 million of which we used to repay insurance proceeds previously collected under the policy we maintained for the risk of expropriation) and are due to receive the remaining principal amount of approximately $142 million in installments through the third quarter of 2016. We intend to use these remaining proceeds, as they are received, for the repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. Any failure by PDVSA Gas to pay these installments when due would reduce the amount of funds available to us in the future for these purposes. PDVSA\u2019s payments to many of its suppliers and partners are currently significantly in arrears. Additionally the ongoing social, political, economic and legal climate has given rise to significant uncertainties about the country\u2019s economic and political stability. Since the presidential election in the first half of 2013, the Venezuelan government has increasingly used foreign-exchange, price and capital controls to attempt to address the country\u2019s economic challenges. If current political unrest were to develop into a prolonged period of governmental or economic instability, or if PDVSA becomes increasingly unable to pay its suppliers and partners due to the detrimental effect of recent commodity price declines on Venezuela\u2019s economy or for other reasons, our ability to recover in full the remaining proceeds from PDVSA Gas could be adversely impacted.\nThe erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our customers finance their exploration and development activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. During times when the oil or natural gas markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience a downturn in their financial condition. A reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, the lack of availability of debt or equity financing or other factors that negatively impact our customers\u2019 financial condition could result in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending for our products and services, which may result in their cancellation of month-to-month contracts, the cancellation or delay of scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment, their determination not to enter into new natural gas compression service contracts or purchase new compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment, or their determination to cancel or delay orders for our products and services. Any such action by our customers would reduce demand for our products and services. Reduced demand for our products and services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, in the event of the financial failure of a customer, we could experience a loss on all or a portion of our outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer.\nFailure to timely and cost-effectively execute on larger projects could adversely affect our business.\nSome of our projects have a relatively larger size and scope than the majority of our projects, which can translate into more technically challenging conditions or performance specifications for our products and services. Contracts with our customers generally specify delivery dates, performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform. Any failure to execute such larger projects in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur losses on fixed-price contracts, which constitute a significant portion of our fabrication business.\nIn connection with projects covered by fixed-price contracts, we generally bear the risk of cost over-runs, operating cost inflation, labor availability and productivity, and supplier and subcontractor pricing and performance unless they result from customer-requested change orders. Under both our fixed-price contracts and our cost-reimbursable contracts, we may rely on third parties for many support services, and we could be subject to liability for their failures. For example, we have experienced losses on certain large fabrication projects that have negatively impacted our fabrication results. Any failure to accurately estimate our costs and the time required for a fixed-price fabrication project could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are engaged in ongoing litigation regarding our qualification as a Heavy Equipment Dealer, the qualification of our natural gas compressors as Heavy Equipment and the resulting appraisal of our natural gas compressors for ad valorem tax purposes under revised Texas statutes. If this litigation is resolved against us, or if in the future we do not qualify as a Heavy Equipment Dealer or our compressors do not qualify as Heavy Equipment because of new or revised Texas statutes, we will incur additional taxes which would adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn 2011, the Texas Legislature enacted changes related to the appraisal of natural gas compressors for ad valorem tax purposes by expanding the definitions of \u201cHeavy Equipment Dealer\u201d and \u201cHeavy Equipment\u201d effective from the beginning of 2012 (the \u201cHeavy Equipment Statutes\u201d). Under the revised statutes, we believe we are a Heavy Equipment Dealer, that our natural gas compressors are Heavy Equipment and that we, therefore, are required to file our ad valorem tax renditions under this new methodology. A large number of appraisal review boards denied our position, and we filed petitions for review in the appropriate district courts. See Note 22 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding legal proceedings to which we are a party, including ongoing litigation regarding our qualification as a heavy equipment dealer, the qualification of our natural gas compressors as heavy equipment and the resulting appraisal of our natural gas compressors for ad valorem tax purposes under revised Texas statutes.\nAs a result of the new methodology, our ad valorem tax expense (which is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)) includes a benefit of $12.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Since the change in methodology became effective in 2012, we have recorded an aggregate benefit of $26.9 million as of December 31, 2014, of which approximately $6.2 million has been agreed to by a number of appraisal review boards and county appraisal districts and $20.7 million has been disputed and is currently in litigation. Recognizing the similarity of the issues and that these cases will ultimately be resolved by the Texas appellate courts, we have reached, or intend to reach, agreements with some of the appraisal districts to stay or abate certain of these pending district court cases. If we are unsuccessful in our litigation with the appraisal districts, we would be required to pay ad valorem taxes up to the aggregate benefit we have recorded, and the additional ad valorem tax payments may also be subject to substantial penalties and interest. Also, if we are unsuccessful in our litigation with the appraisal districts, or if legislation is enacted in Texas that repeals or alters the Heavy Equipment Statutes such that in the future we do not qualify as a Heavy Equipment Dealer or our compressors do not qualify as Heavy Equipment, then we would likely be required to pay these ad valorem taxes under the old methodology going forward, which would increase our quarterly cost of sales expense up to approximately the amount of our then most recent quarterly benefit recorded, and as a result impact our future results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, because the Partnership recorded $10.2 million of the $12.1 million benefit during the year ended December 31, 2014, and is expected to record a significant portion of our and the Partnership\u2019s consolidated benefit in future periods (including 2015), if this litigation is resolved against us or if legislation is enacted in Texas that repeals or alters the Heavy Equipment statutes, then the Partnership would also be negatively impacted, which could impair its ability to maintain or increase its distributions to its equity holders, including us, and as a result impact our results of operations and cash flows and also our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), similar worldwide anti-bribery laws and trade control laws. If we are found to have violated the FCPA or other legal requirements, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could materially harm our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur international operations require us to comply with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery and anti-corruption. For example, the FCPA and similar laws and regulations of other countries prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage.\nWe operate in many parts of the world that experience high levels of corruption, and our business brings us in frequent contact with foreign officials. Our compliance policies and programs mandate compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws but may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance. Our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents. Actual or alleged violations of these laws could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant legal expenses, and could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other anti-bribery law violations due to our own acts or omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others (including our joint venture partners, agents or other third party representatives), we could suffer from severe civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could materially harm our reputation, business, results of operations financial condition and liquidity. Separately, we may face competitive disadvantages if our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other advantages by making payments or using other methods that are prohibited by U.S. and international laws and regulations.\nWe also are subject to other laws and regulations governing our operations, including regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control and various non-U.S. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons and customs requirements. Trade control laws are complex and constantly changing. Our compliance policies and programs increase our cost of doing business and may not work effectively to ensure our compliance with trade control laws. If we undergo an investigation of potential violations of trade control laws by U.S. or foreign authorities or if we fail to comply with these laws, we may incur significant legal expenses or be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other sanctions and remedial measures, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the international markets in which we operate. A decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could reduce profits from international operations and the value of our international net assets.\nWe operate in many international countries. We anticipate that there will be instances in which costs and revenues will not be exactly matched with respect to currency denomination. We generally do not hedge exchange rate exposures, which exposes us to the risk of exchange rate losses. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities that are receivable or payable in currency other than our subsidiaries\u2019 functional currency are included in our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, currency fluctuations cause the U.S. dollar value of our international results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations. This could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. For example, other (income) expense, net, during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included foreign currency losses of $8.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively.\nTo the extent we expand geographically, we expect that increasing portions of our revenues, costs, assets and liabilities will be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency valuations. We may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Further, the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency, resulting in our inability to hedge against these risks.\nWe depend on distributions from our subsidiaries, including the Partnership, to meet our capital needs and pay dividends to our stockholders.\nTo generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations, fund our business and pay dividends, we depend on the cash flows and distributions from our operating subsidiaries, including cash distributions from the Partnership to us attributable to our ownership interest in the Partnership. Applicable law and contractual restrictions (including restrictions in the Partnership\u2019s debt instruments and partnership agreement) may negatively impact our ability to obtain such distributions from our subsidiaries, including the rights of the creditors of the Partnership that would often be superior to our interests in the Partnership. Furthermore, a decline in the Partnership\u2019s revenues or increases in its expenses, principal and interest payments under existing and future debt instruments, working capital requirements or other cash needs would limit the amount of cash the Partnership has available to distribute to its equity holders, including us, which would reduce the amount of cash available for payment of our debt, payment of dividends and the funding of our business requirements, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we declared and paid quarterly dividends of $0.15 per share of common stock during 2014, there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future.\nDuring 2014, our Board of Directors declared and paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per share of common stock to our stockholders. We cannot provide assurance that we would, at any time in the future, again generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend or that our board of directors would determine to use any such surplus or our net profits to pay a dividend.\nFuture dividends may be affected by, among other factors:\n\u00b7 the availability of surplus or net profits, which in turn depend on the performance of our business and operating subsidiaries, including the Partnership;\n\u00b7 the amount of cash distributions we receive from the Partnership attributable to our ownership interest in the Partnership;\n\u00b7 our future capital requirements; and\n\u00b7 changes in U.S. federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will declare or pay dividends in any particular amounts or at all in the future. A decision not to pay dividends or a reduction in our dividend payments in the future could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nAs a result of the April 2014 MidCon Acquisition, the Partnership depends on Williams Partners, L.P. (\u201cWilliams\u201d) for a significant portion of its revenue. The Partnership\u2019s loss of its business with Williams or the inability or failure of Williams to meet its payment obligations may adversely affect the Partnership\u2019s financial results, which could limit the amount of cash the Partnership has available for distribution to its equity holders, including us.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, no customer individually accounted for 10% or more of the Partnership\u2019s total revenue. In connection with the April 2014 MidCon Acquisition, the Partnership and Access Midstream Partners LP (\u201cAccess\u201d) entered into a seven-year contract operations services agreement under which the Partnership provided contract compression services in 2014 to Access in regions including the Permian, Eagle Ford, Barnett, Anadarko, Mississippi Lime, Granite Wash, Woodford, Haynesville and Niobrara Basins. During the year ended December 31, 2014, Access accounted for approximately 12% of the Partnership\u2019s revenue. Access merged with Williams in February 2015 and, when combined, Access and Williams would have accounted for approximately 15% of the Partnership\u2019s revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Partnership\u2019s loss of its business with Williams, unless offset by additional contract compression services revenue from other customers, or the inability or failure of Williams to meet its payment obligations could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to its equity holders, including us. A reduction in the Partnership\u2019s cash distributions to us would reduce the amount of cash available for payment of our debt and to fund our business requirements, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt that could limit our ability to fund future growth and operations and increase our exposure to risk during adverse economic conditions.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had approximately $2.0 billion in outstanding debt obligations. Many factors, including factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness. These factors include those discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors and those listed in the Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section included in Part I of this report.\nOur substantial debt and associated commitments could have important adverse consequences. For example, these commitments could:\n\u00b7 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our contractual obligations;\n\u00b7 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other corporate requirements;\n\u00b7 increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because the interest payments on a portion of our debt are based upon variable interest rates and a portion can adjust based upon our credit statistics;\n\u00b7 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u00b7 place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or less restrictive covenants in such debt; and\n\u00b7 limit our ability to refinance our debt in the future or borrow additional funds.\nCovenants in our debt agreements may impair our ability to operate our business.\nOur senior secured credit facility contains various covenants with which we or certain of our subsidiaries must comply, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use of proceeds from borrowings and limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate, sell assets, make certain investments and acquisitions, make loans, grant liens, repurchase equity and pay dividends and distributions. We are also subject to financial covenants, including a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to Total Interest Expense (as defined in the credit agreement) of not less than 2.25 to 1.0, a ratio of consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the credit agreement) to Adjusted EBITDA of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 and a ratio of Senior Secured Debt (as defined in the credit agreement) to Adjusted EBITDA of not greater than 4.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2014, we maintained a 14.8 to 1.0 Adjusted EBITDA to Total Interest Expense ratio, a 1.6 to 1.0 consolidated Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio and a 0.8 to 1.0 Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio. If we fail to remain in compliance with our financial covenants we would be in default under our debt agreements. In addition, if we experience a material adverse effect on our assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations that, taken as a whole, impacts our ability to perform our obligations under our debt agreements, this could lead to a default under our debt agreements. A default under one or more of our debt agreements would trigger cross-default provisions under certain of our other debt agreements, which would accelerate our obligation to repay our indebtedness under those agreements. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our debt agreements.\nThe Partnership\u2019s senior secured credit agreement (the \u201cPartnership Credit Agreement\u201d) contains various covenants with which the Partnership must comply, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use of proceeds from borrowings and limitations on the Partnership\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate, sell assets, make certain investments and acquisitions, make loans, grant liens, repurchase equity and pay dividends and distributions. The Partnership Credit Agreement also contains various covenants requiring mandatory prepayments from the net cash proceeds of certain asset transfers. The Partnership must maintain various consolidated financial ratios, including a ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement) to Total Interest Expense (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.75 to 1.0, a ratio of Total Debt (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement) to EBITDA of not greater than 5.25 to 1.0 (subject to a temporary increase to 5.5 to 1.0 for any quarter during which an acquisition meeting certain thresholds is completed and for the following two quarters after the acquisition closes) and a ratio of Senior Secured Debt (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement) to EBITDA of not greater than 4.0 to 1.0. Because the August 2014 MidCon Acquisition closed during the third quarter of 2014, the Partnership\u2019s Total Debt to EBITDA ratio threshold was temporarily increased to 5.5 to 1.0 during the quarter ended September 30, 2014 and will continue at that level through March 31, 2015, reverting to 5.25 to 1.0 for the quarter ending June 30, 2015 and subsequent quarters. As of December 31, 2014, the Partnership maintained a 5.2 to 1.0 EBITDA to Total Interest Expense ratio, a 4.3 to 1.0 Total Debt to EBITDA ratio and a 2.0 to 1.0 Senior Secured Debt to EBITDA ratio. A material adverse effect with respect to the Partnership\u2019s assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations that, taken as a whole, impacts the Partnership\u2019s ability to perform its obligations under the Partnership Credit Agreement, could lead to a default under that agreement. A default under one of the Partnership\u2019s debt agreements would trigger cross-default provisions under the Partnership\u2019s other debt agreements, which would accelerate the Partnership\u2019s obligation to repay its indebtedness under those agreements. As of December 31, 2014, the Partnership was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Partnership Credit Agreement.\nThe breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under one or more of our debt agreements, which could cause our indebtedness under those agreements to become due and payable. If the repayment obligations on any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not be able to repay the debt or refinance the debt on acceptable terms, and our financial position would be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be vulnerable to interest rate increases due to our floating rate debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, after taking into consideration interest rate swaps, we had $585.5 million of outstanding indebtedness that was effectively subject to floating interest rates. Changes in economic conditions outside of our control could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense and reducing the funds available for capital investment, operations or other purposes. A 1% increase in the effective interest rate on our outstanding debt subject to floating interest rates at December 31, 2014 would result in an annual increase in our interest expense of approximately $5.9 million.\nMany of our North America contract operations services contracts have short initial terms and after the initial term are cancelable on short notice, and we cannot be sure that such contracts will be extended or renewed after the end of the initial contractual term. Any such nonrenewals, or renewals at reduced rates, or the loss of contracts with any significant customer, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe length of our contract operations services contracts with customers varies based on operating conditions and customer needs. In North America, our initial contract terms typically are not long enough to enable us to recoup the cost of the equipment we utilize to provide contract operations services and these contracts are typically cancelable on short notice after the initial term. We cannot be sure that a substantial number of these contracts will be extended or renewed by our customers or that any of our customers will continue to contract with us. The inability to negotiate extensions or renew a substantial portion of our North America contract operations services contracts, the renewal of such contracts at reduced rates, the inability to contract for additional services with our customers or the loss of all or a significant portion of our services contracts with any significant customer could lead to a reduction in revenues and net income and could require us to record additional asset impairments. This could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our international contract operations services contracts are long-term, substantial contracts and the termination of any of such contracts could have a material impact on our business.\nOur international contract operations services contracts are typically longer-term contracts for more comprehensive projects than our North America contract operations services contracts. As a result, the termination of any such contract may lead to a reduction in our revenues and net income, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, litigation and other proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us, requiring material future cash payments or charges, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to various claims, both in litigation and binding arbitration proceedings. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to various claims, which, if not resolved within amounts we have accrued, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, any claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. See Note 22 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding certain legal proceedings to which we are a party, including ongoing litigation regarding our qualification as a heavy equipment dealer, the qualification of our natural gas compressors as heavy equipment and the resulting appraisal of our natural gas compressors for ad valorem tax purposes under revised Texas statutes.\nWe may not be able to consummate additional contributions or sales of portions of our U.S. contract operations business to the Partnership.\nIn the future, we may transfer additional portions of our U.S. contract operations business to the Partnership, but we are under no obligation to do so. Likewise, the Partnership is under no obligation to purchase any additional portions of that business. The consummation of any future sales of additional portions of that business and the timing of such sales will depend upon, among other things:\n\u00b7 our agreement with the Partnership regarding the terms of such sales, which will require the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the Partnership\u2019s general partner, which is comprised exclusively of independent directors;\n\u00b7 the Partnership\u2019s ability to finance such purchases on acceptable terms, which could be impacted by general equity and debt market conditions as well as conditions in the markets specific to master limited partnerships; and\n\u00b7 the Partnership\u2019s and our compliance with our respective debt agreements.\nThe Partnership intends to fund any future acquisitions from us with external sources of capital, including additional borrowings under its credit facility and/or public or private offerings of equity or debt. If the Partnership is not able to fund future acquisitions of our U.S. contract operations business, or if we are otherwise unable to consummate additional contributions or sales of a portion of our U.S. contract operations business to the Partnership, we may not be able to capitalize on what we believe is the Partnership\u2019s lower cost of capital.\nWe depend on particular suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases.\nSome of the components used in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks, including price increases, inferior component quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner. We do not have long-term contracts with some of these sources, and the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a negative impact on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships. Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe face significant competitive pressures that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance.\nOur businesses are highly competitive and there are low barriers to entry, especially our natural gas compression services and fabrication business. Our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to technological changes within our industry and changes in economic and market conditions, more readily take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Our ability to renew or replace existing contract operations service contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors. In our production and processing equipment business, we have different competitors in the standard and custom-engineered equipment markets. Competitors in the standard equipment market include several large companies and a large number of small, regional fabricators. Competition in the standard equipment market is generally based upon price and availability. Our competition in the custom-engineered market usually consists of larger companies with the ability to provide integrated projects and product support after the sale. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products, equipment or services or substantially decrease the price at which they offer their products, equipment or services, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nIn addition, we could face significant competition from new entrants into the compression services and fabrication business. Some of our existing competitors or new entrants may expand or fabricate new compression units that would create additional competition for the products, equipment or services we provide to our customers.\nWe also may not be able to take advantage of certain opportunities or make certain investments because of our debt levels and our other obligations. Any of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nOur operations entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures and natural disasters, which could result in uncontrollable flows of natural gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. These risks may expose us, as an equipment operator and fabricator, to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damage. The insurance we carry against many of these risks may not be adequate to cover our claims or losses. We currently have a minimal amount of insurance on our offshore assets. In addition, we are substantially self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation, employer\u2019s liability, property, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nThreats of cyber attacks or terrorism could affect our business.\nWe may be threatened by problems such as cyber attacks, computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. Our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation of security measures, our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our assets may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to service our customers. We may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict. The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs. These types of events could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources, and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.\nThe tax treatment of the Partnership depends on its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as it not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. The Partnership could lose its status as a partnership for a number of reasons, including not having enough \u201cqualifying income.\u201d If the IRS treats the Partnership as a corporation or if the Partnership becomes subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, it would substantially reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to the Partnership\u2019s unitholders and undermine the cost of capital advantage we believe the Partnership has.\nThe anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in the Partnership\u2019s common units depends largely on it being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Partnership has not received a ruling from the IRS on this or any other tax matter affecting it.\nDespite the fact that the Partnership is a limited partnership under Delaware law, a publicly traded partnership such as the Partnership will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless 90% or more of its gross income from its business activities are \u201cqualifying income\u201d under Section 7704(d) of the Code. \u201cQualifying income\u201d includes income and gains derived from the exploration, development, production, processing, transportation, storage and marketing of natural gas and natural gas products or other passive types of income such as interest and dividends. Although we do not believe based upon its current operations that the Partnership is treated as a corporation, the Partnership could be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject to taxation as an entity if its gross income is not properly classified as qualifying income, there is a change in the Partnership\u2019s business or there is a change in current law.\nIf the Partnership were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would pay U.S. federal income tax at the corporate tax rate and would also likely pay state income tax. Treatment of the Partnership as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to its unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of its common units, including the Partnership common units we own, and the amount of distributions that we receive from the Partnership.\nCurrent law may change so as to cause the Partnership to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject it to entity-level taxation. In addition, because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. The Partnership\u2019s partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects it to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects it to entity-level taxation for U.S. federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution levels of the Partnership may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on it at the option of its general partner without the consent of its unitholders. If the Partnership were to be taxed at the entity level, it would lose the comparative cost of capital advantage we believe it has over time as compared to a corporation.\nThe tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or our investment in the Partnership\u2019s common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nThe present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including the Partnership, or our investment in the Partnership may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. For example, the Obama administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2016 recommends that certain publicly traded partnerships earning income from activities related to fossil fuels be taxed as corporations beginning in 2021. From time to time, members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that could affect publicly traded partnerships. If successful, the Obama administration\u2019s proposal or other similar proposals could eliminate the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly-traded partnerships as corporations upon which the Partnership relies for its treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for the Partnership to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes, or other proposals, will be reconsidered or will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes or differing judicial interpretations of existing laws could negatively impact the value of our investment in the Partnership and the amount of distributions that we receive from the Partnership.\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in locations throughout the United States and internationally and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governments. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our tax provision or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, international, U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nU.S. Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect demand for our contract operations services and production and processing equipment.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, and proposals have been made to enact separate U.S. federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.\nAt the U.S. federal level, the EPA has asserted U.S. federal regulatory authority pursuant to the U.S. federal Safe Drinking Water Act (the \u201cSDWA\u201d) over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2013 addressing the performance of such activities. Also, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. To date, no other action has been taken. Further, the EPA has announced its intention to propose regulations under the CWA by sometime in 2015 governing wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations. In addition, the EPA is conducting a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on water resources and a draft final report is anticipated sometime in 2015 for peer review and public comment. The results of this study or similar governmental review could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. Also, the U.S. Department of the Interior published a revised proposed rule on May 16, 2013, that would update exiting regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on U.S. federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new or more stringent U.S. federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. Any such restrictions could reduce demand for our contract operations services and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNew regulations, proposed regulations and proposed modifications to existing regulations under the CAA, if implemented, could result in increased compliance costs.\nOn August 20, 2010, the EPA published new regulations under the CAA to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from existing stationary reciprocal internal combustion engines. The rule would have required us to undertake certain expenditures and activities, including purchasing and installing emissions control equipment, such as oxidation catalysts or non-selective catalytic reduction equipment, on a portion of our engines located at certain sources of hazardous air pollutants and all our engines over a certain size regardless of location, following prescribed maintenance practices for engines (which are consistent with our existing practices), and implementing additional emissions testing and monitoring. Following legal challenges to the 2010 rule, the EPA reconsidered the rule and published revisions to the rule on January 30, 2013. The revised rule requires management practices for all covered engines but requires catalyst installation only on larger equipment at sites that are not deemed to be \u201cremote.\u201d Compliance with the final rule was required by October 2013.\nOn May 21, 2012, the EPA issued new ozone nonattainment designations for all areas except Chicago, in relation to the 2008 NAAQS for ozone. Among other things, these new designations add Wise County, Texas to the DFW nonattainment area. This new designation will require Texas to modify its SIP to include a plan for Wise County to come into compliance with the ozone NAAQS. This modification process started in January 2014, and the State of Texas anticipates having new regulations in place by mid-2015. If Texas implements the same control requirements in Wise County that are already in place in the other counties in the DFW nonattainment area, we could be required to modify or remove and replace a significant amount of equipment we currently utilize in Wise County. However, at this point we cannot predict what Texas\u2019 new SIP will require or what equipment will still be operating in Wise County when it comes into effect and, as a result, we cannot currently accurately predict the impact or cost to comply.\nOn August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that establish new air emission controls for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with production and processing activities. Among other things, the rules establish specific requirements regarding emissions from compressors and controllers at natural gas gathering and boosting stations and processing plants together with dehydrators and storage tanks at natural gas processing plants, compressor stations and gathering and boosting stations. In addition, the rules establish new requirements for leak detection and repair of leaks at natural gas processing plants that exceed 500 parts per million in concentration.\nIn addition, in January 2011, the TCEQ finalized revisions to certain air permit programs that significantly increase air emissions-related requirements for new and certain existing oil and gas production and gathering sites in the Barnett Shale production area. The final rule established new emissions standards for engines, which could impact the operation of specific categories of engines by requiring the use of alternative engines, compressor packages or the installation of aftermarket emissions control equipment. The rule became effective for the Barnett Shale production area in April 2011, and the lower emissions standards will become applicable between 2020 and 2030 depending on the type of engine and the permitting requirements. A number of other states where our engines are operated have adopted or are considering adopting additional regulations that could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements for engines, some of which could entail material costs to comply. At this point, however, we cannot predict whether any such rules would require us to incur material costs.\nThese new regulations and proposals, when finalized, and any other new regulations requiring the installation of more sophisticated pollution control equipment or the adoption of other environmental protection measures, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of governmental regulations; failure to comply with these regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to, for example, the environment, safety and health, export controls, currency exchange, labor and employment and taxation. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance. From time to time, as part of our operations, including newly acquired operations, we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities in the various countries in which we operate.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which may render us liable for remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior owners or operators or other third parties. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. Remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations, and costs associated with new information, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could negatively impact our financial condition, profitability and results of operations. Moreover, failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations.\nWe may need to apply for or amend facility permits or licenses from time to time with respect to storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling, or air emissions relating to manufacturing activities or equipment operations, which subjects us to new or revised permitting conditions that may be onerous or costly to comply with. In addition, certain of our customer service arrangements may require us to operate, on behalf of a specific customer, petroleum storage units such as underground tanks or pipelines and other regulated units, all of which may impose additional compliance and permitting obligations.\nWe conduct operations at numerous facilities in a wide variety of locations across the continental U.S. and internationally. The operations at many of these facilities require environmental permits or other authorizations. Additionally, natural gas compressors at many of our customers\u2019 facilities require individual air permits or general authorizations to operate under various air regulatory programs established by rule or regulation. These permits and authorizations frequently contain numerous compliance requirements, including monitoring and reporting obligations and operational restrictions, such as emission limits. Given the large number of facilities in which we operate, and the numerous environmental permits and other authorizations that are applicable to our operations, we may occasionally identify or be notified of technical violations of certain requirements existing in various permits or other authorizations. Occasionally, we have been assessed penalties for our non-compliance, and we could be subject to such penalties in the future.\nWe routinely deal with natural gas, oil and other petroleum products. Hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on, under or from properties used by us to provide contract operations services or inactive compression storage or on or under other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigatory, remediation and monitoring requirements under environmental laws and regulations.\nThe modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations, or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production, gathering and pipeline companies, including our customers, which in turn could have a negative impact on us.\nClimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased compliance costs.\nThe U.S. Congress has previously considered legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. One bill, passed by the House of Representatives in 2009, but never adopted by the full Congress, would have required greenhouse gas emissions reductions by covered sources of as much as 17% from 2005 levels by 2020 and by as much as 83% by 2050. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other initiatives continue to be proposed that may be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. In addition, almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that smaller sources such as our gas-fired compressors could become subject to greenhouse gas-related regulation. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations.\nIndependent of Congress, the EPA has been pursuing regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions under its existing CAA authority. The EPA has adopted rules requiring many facilities, including petroleum and natural gas systems, to inventory and report their greenhouse gas emissions. These rules triggered reporting obligations for some sites we operated in 2014.\nIn addition, the EPA in June 2010 published a final rule providing for the tailored applicability of air permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA reported that the rulemaking was necessary because without it certain permitting requirements would apply as of January 2011 at an emissions level that would have greatly increased the number of required permits and, among other things, imposed undue costs on small sources and overwhelmed the resources of permitting authorities. In the rule, the EPA established two initial steps of phase-in to minimize those burdens, excluding certain smaller sources from greenhouse gas permitting until at least April 30, 2016. On January 2, 2011, the first step of the phase-in applied only to new projects at major sources (as defined under those CAA permitting programs) that, among other things, increase net greenhouse gas emissions by 75,000 tons per year. On July 1, 2011, the second step of the phase-in began requiring permitting for otherwise minor sources of air emissions that have the potential to emit at least 100,000 tons per year of greenhouse gases. On June 29, 2012, the EPA issued final regulations for \u201cPhase III\u201d of its program, retaining the permitting thresholds established in Phases I and II. On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that greenhouse gas emissions alone cannot trigger an obligation to obtain such an air permit even if the project will substantially increase the source\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. However, for those sources that trigger such air permitting requirements based on their traditional criteria pollutant emissions, the permit must include a limit for greenhouse gases. In addition, the Court concluded that the rule was flawed because the EPA failed to identify a de minimis threshold for greenhouse gases below which Best Available Control Technology would not be required. The EPA has yet to set this threshold. This rule affects some of our and our customers\u2019 largest new or modified facilities going forward.\nAlthough it is not currently possible to predict how any proposed or future greenhouse gas legislation or regulation by Congress, the states or multi-state regions will impact our business, any legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe price of our common stock and the Partnership\u2019s common units may be volatile.\nSome of the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are quarterly increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community and speculation in the press or investment community about our financial condition or results of operations. General market conditions and North America or international economic factors and political events unrelated to our performance may also affect our stock price. In addition, the price of our common stock may be impacted by changes in the value of our investment in and/or distributions from the Partnership. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent trends in the price of our common stock to predict the future price of our common stock or our financial results.\nOur charter and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would result in the purchase of our stockholders\u2019 shares of common stock at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nThere are provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would result in the purchase of our stockholders\u2019 shares of common stock at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, such as limitations on stockholder actions by written consent and on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. Delaware corporation law may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by the board of directors.", "PERMNO": 92245, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "AROC"}
