{"cik": "1070081", "company": "PTC THERAPEUTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties\nnot presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other widespread outbreaks of contagious disease, which are, and may continue to, delay our ability to complete our ongoing clinical trials and initiate future clinical trials, disrupt regulatory activities and have other adverse effects on our business and operations, including the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, our operations and may significantly impact our operating results. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial disruption in the financial markets and economies, which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations.\nSignificant outbreaks of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, could have a material impact on our business operations and operating results. In December 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus, COVID-19, causing respiratory illness emerged in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province of China. Since that time, multiple other countries throughout the world, including the United States, have been affected by the spread of the virus. To date, responsive measures such as social distancing, vaccine mandates, travel bans and quarantines have been put into place in many countries throughout the world, including the United States. These responsive measures have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on business and commerce worldwide, as worker shortages have occurred, supply chains have been disrupted and facilities and production have been suspended or curtailed.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and the responsive measures taken to date have limited our access to our facilities, the access of trial participants to clinical sites and caused the majority of our employees to work from home. We continue to monitor the global spread and response of international, national and local authorities of COVID-19 and have put in place and will continue to put in place measures as appropriate and necessary for our business and the safety of our employees. While we expect the pandemic to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and operations, and the pandemic may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of the future progression of the COVID-19 pandemic or its effects on our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations at this time.\nFurthermore, we have clinical trial sites located in countries that have been affected by COVID-19 that have been and may continue to be disrupted, including the United States. The disruption of our clinical trial sites has had an adverse impact on our clinical trial plans and timelines. The COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely affected our ability to timely enroll patients for our clinical trials which may delay the completion of clinical trials. For example, we have experienced delays in enrolling our registration-directed Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vatiquinone in children with mitochondrial disease associated seizures as some patients have been unable or hesitant to travel to clinical trial sites due to the COVID-19 pandemic and we now anticipate results from this trial to be available in the fourth quarter of 2022. Such disruptions could result in significant delays or could require us to abandon a clinical trial altogether. For additional information, see the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates\u201d titled, \u201cIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\u201d\nOur ability to market and promote our products, as well as patient demand for our products may also be impacted. Because access to healthcare providers and institutions has been limited in certain regions of the world, we have had to transition to virtual and online promotion to reach existing and potential customers in those areas. Healthcare provider and institution restrictions and closures, as well as patient reticence to visit their physicians may also result in a decrease in product prescribing.\nSignificant suppliers and manufacturing located in countries that have been affected by COVID-19 may also be disrupted, which may affect our ability to procure items that are essential for our research and development activities and may cause disruptions or delays in our sales and commercialization efforts of approved products and clinical trials with respect to product candidates. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, China has at times imposed complete lockdowns\nof cities that have experienced a high number of COVID-19 cases. We contract with third-party manufacturers located in China that may be forced to shut down for an unknown amount of time if the Chinese government determines that there is a COVID-19 outbreak where they are located. Additionally, we have experienced delays in certain of our preclinical programs due to a shortage in non-human primates. Many manufacturers have also experienced shortages of key equipment and ingredients needed for product manufacturing. Our business and operations may be disrupted as resources, components and materials that are essential for our research and development, commercialization and manufacturing activities may be diverted towards the ongoing efforts to rapidly diagnose, find and distribute treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 and may not be readily available. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic may also redirect resources with respect to regulatory matters in a way that would adversely impact our ability to progress to regulatory approval. For instance, certain of the third-party development and manufacturing organizations that we contract with for analytical testing had previously prioritized materials and testing kits to support COVID-19 testing, diverted employees to support COVID-19 related programs and reduced their workforce to comply with social distancing requirements imposed in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of this shift in resources in 2020, we experienced a delay in generating analytical data needed to respond to questions sent by the EMA regarding our MAA for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the EEA. Following a clock stop extension, we submitted responses to the EMA\u2019s questions. We may also choose to redirect our own resources in a way that may adversely impact or delay certain of our programs. For additional information, see the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates\u201d titled, \u201cWe contract with third parties for the manufacture and distribution of our products and certain of our product candidates, which may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates, such quantities may not meet the applicable regulatory quality standards, or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization or development efforts. For certain of our product candidates, we may also directly engage in manufacturing, which will require significant expenditures and compliance with FDA\u2019s manufacturing requirements.\u201d\nFurthermore, we may face impediments to regulatory meetings and approvals due to measures intended to limit in-person interactions. For example, due to delays related to responsive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic taken in Europe, including travel bans and quarantines, the CHMP required additional time to complete its pre-approval inspections and imposed a clock stop extension with respect to our MAA for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the EEA. To the extent that inspections of facilities by governmental authorities are required, the review of our marketing applications or supplements may further be delayed as regulatory authorities, such as FDA, have significantly limited facility inspections during the pandemic.\nOur own relationships with commercial customers and suppliers could be affected if the government places rated or allocation orders under the Defense Production Act, directly or through higher tier contractors, either with respect to our products or our partners\u2019 supplies or products that may be related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the Defense Production Act provides the U.S. President with authority to direct private sector production in, among other circumstances, national emergencies. Once the Defense Production Act is invoked, federal agencies can use it to direct companies to prioritize the sale of goods to the federal government. On March 18, 2020, former U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order authorizing use of the Defense Production Act to acquire \u201chealth and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19.\u201d President Biden has also directed that executive agencies consider whether further use of the Defense Production Act is appropriate in support of the COVID-19 response effort. Invocation of the Defense Production Act to prioritize orders can result in diversion of Company products intended for our commercial customers to the government or interfere with our ability to obtain supplies and services necessary to our business.\nWe cannot foresee if and when the COVID-19 pandemic will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the COVID-19 pandemic is not effectively and timely controlled, we may experience further or prolonged disruption of our clinical trials, third-party suppliers or contract manufacturers, extended closures of facilities, such as clinical trial sites, suppliers, manufacturers and distributors, including single source suppliers, and further delays with respect to regulatory approvals or the commercialization of any current or future products. Such events may materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial condition. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions in the financial markets, and may continue to cause such disruptions, which could impact our ability to raise additional funds and has also impacted, and may continue to impact, the volatility of our stock price and trading in our stock. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economies worldwide, which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations. We cannot be certain what the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nwill be on our business and it has the potential to materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Gene Therapy Platform\nWe may fail to obtain regulatory approval for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency within our expected timeline or at all.\nIn July 2017, an end-of-phase 2 meeting was held with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the clinical data from two completed PTC-AADC clinical trials, and non-clinical and manufacturing data available to date were reviewed. The FDA provided feedback indicating that the clinical and non-clinical data available to date were sufficient to support a submission for a biologics license application, or BLA, without undertaking additional trials at this time. In late 2019, the FDA requested additional information concerning the use of the commercial delivery system for PTC-AADC in young patients. Based on the FDA input, including with respect to manufacturing, we are preparing a BLA for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States, which we anticipate submitting to the FDA in the second quarter of 2022. In April 2018, Agilis held a protocol assistance meeting with the Scientific Advice Working Party of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in anticipation of the expected submission of a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in the European Union, or EU and received feedback indicating the clinical and non-clinical data available to date were sufficient to support a submission for an MAA without undertaking additional trials or studies at this time. In January 2020, we submitted an MAA to the EMA for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the EEA. However, certain of the third-party development and manufacturing organizations that we contract with for analytical testing have prioritized materials and testing kits to support COVID-19 testing, diverted employees to support COVID-19 related programs and reduced their workforce to comply with social distancing requirements imposed in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of this shift in resources, we experienced a delay in generating analytical data needed to respond to questions sent by the EMA regarding our MAA for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency. Following a clock stop extension, we submitted responses to the EMA\u2019s questions. Subsequently, due to delays related to responsive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic taken in Europe, including travel bans and quarantines, the CHMP required additional time to complete its pre-approval inspections and imposed a clock stop extension with respect to our MAA for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the EEA. We expect an opinion from the CHMP in April 2022. There is no guarantee that we will be able to make our BLA submissions, or respond to the EMA\u2019s additional data requests in support of our manufacturing process, within our expected timelines or that the FDA, upon making our BLA submission, or the EMA would not have additional comments or requirements with respect to the respective submissions that we would be required to address before such applications would be accepted for regulatory review or before obtaining regulatory approval, or that the FDA or the EMA will approve PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency at all. Any delays in obtaining regulatory approval from either the FDA and/or the EMA, or if we never obtain regulatory approval from either the FDA and/or the EMA, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGene therapies are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience manufacturing problems that result in delays in the development or commercialization of our gene therapy product candidates or otherwise harm our business.\nThe manufacture of gene therapy products and our other gene therapy product candidates, such as PTC-AADC, is technically complex and necessitates substantial expertise and capital investment. Production difficulties caused by unforeseen events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, may delay the availability of material for clinical studies and commercial product for any of our gene therapy product candidates that may receive regulatory approval in the future. We presently contract a third party manufacturer to provide sufficient quantities of our PTC-AADC program materials to meet anticipated clinical trial and commercial scale demands. In 2021, we began cGMP manufacturing of clinical material at the Hopewell Facility for certain of our gene therapy product candidates other than PTC-AADC. We still rely on third-party manufacturers to complete product testing for all of our gene therapy product candidates that we manufacture at the Hopewell Facility as well as to provide sufficient quantities of certain program materials that we have not yet transitioned to the Hopewell Facility. To the extent we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with manufacturing and quality experience to oversee our contract manufacturers.\nTo meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, we or the third party from whom we currently obtain our commercial supply of PTC-AADC may need to increase the scale of production and confirm with the applicable regulatory authorities that the commercial material is comparable to the material used in clinical trials in addition to satisfying other regulatory obligations, or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. In general, gene therapy products have only in limited cases been manufactured at scales sufficient for pivotal trials and commercialization. Few pharmaceutical contract manufacturers specialize in gene therapy products and those that do are still developing appropriate processes, controls and facilities for large-scale production. While we believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify and establish relationships with such sources, if necessary, in a timely manner or at all, and what the terms and costs of such new arrangements would be, or that such alternate suppliers would be able to supply our potential commercial needs. To the extent that we decide to manufacture our own clinical and commercial supply as an alternative source of supply, there is no guarantee that we will be able to cost-effectively produce sufficient quantities of our program materials. Any switch from our current manufacturer would result in a significant delay, would require FDA approval, and cause material additional costs.\nAs further described in these risks, the manufacturers of pharmaceutical products must comply with strictly enforced cGMP requirements, state and federal regulations, as well as ex-U.S. requirements when applicable. Any failure by us or our contract manufacturing organizations to adhere to or document compliance to such regulatory requirements could lead to a delay or interruption in the availability of our program materials for clinical studies or commercial use, among other consequences. If we or our manufacturers fail to comply with the requirements set forth by the FDA, EMA, or other regulatory authorities, it could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds or termination of clinical studies, warning or untitled letters, regulatory communications warning the public about safety issues with a product, import or export refusals, license revocation, seizures, detentions, or recalls of product candidates or product, operating restrictions, criminal prosecutions or debarment, suits under the civil False Claims act, corporate integrity agreements, or consent decrees any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nDue to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the manufacture of gene therapy products, the FDA issued guidance concerning how sponsors and investigators may address these challenges. This included recommendations regarding the conduct of risk assessments to identify, evaluate, and mitigate factors that may allow for the transmission of the COVID-19 virus by gene therapy products.\nAny dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may also adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, and our ability to commercialize any product candidates that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe have limited experience manufacturing gene therapy products or product candidates on our own and could encounter problems and delays in operating our biologics manufacturing facility that could adversely affect our business.\nIn 2021, we began cGMP manufacturing of clinical material at the Hopewell Facility for certain of our gene therapy product candidates other than PTC-AADC. The Hopewell Facility requires substantial investment and significant expertise, and our management devotes substantial time to its operation. While some of our employees have experience with gene therapy manufacturing, we have previously never manufactured gene therapy product materials as a company and we may encounter unforeseen delays, equipment failure, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures, transportation difficulties, quality control or other issues, including those resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements, as further described in these risks, that could prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of our manufacturing strategy. In addition, competition for skilled personnel within gene therapy manufacturing is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms. Moreover, operating a manufacturing facility may cost more than we currently anticipate. If we experience any problems or delays with the Hopewell Facility, we may need to rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of program materials that we intended to produce ourselves, which may cause additional timing delays due to the availability of contract manufacturers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We presently contract a third party\nmanufacturer to provide sufficient quantities of our PTC-AADC program materials to meet anticipated clinical trial and commercial scale demands.\nAdditionally, while we expect to use the Hopewell Facility in the production of research and cGMP quality plasmid DNA and AAV vectors for gene therapy applications for potential external customers, we have never produced gene therapy product materials for third parties and we have yet to manufacture cGMP gene therapy product materials for our own clinical trials or commercialization. If we are unable to manufacture these product materials to the required specifications for the third parties we contract with, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and we may become subject to regulatory actions. Similarly, if we experience a reduced product yield for our manufactured materials, due to manufacturing issues or otherwise, we may expend significant time and cost to remedy these issues and we may be delayed in our ability to supply product materials to our customers in an efficient manner, all of which could cause us to forgo sales, incur liabilities or lose customers, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may be unable to identify and retain potential customers and we may encounter unforeseen delays that could prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of our third party manufacturing business. For additional information, see the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to Our Business\u201d titled, \u201cWe contract with third parties for the manufacture and distribution of our products and certain of our product candidates, which may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates, such quantities may not meet the applicable regulatory quality standards, or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization or development efforts. For certain of our product candidates, we may also directly engage in manufacturing, which will require significant expenditures and compliance with FDA\u2019s manufacturing requirements.\u201d\nThe process for administering PTC-AADC is complex and includes specific specialized requirements that could delay or prevent the regulatory approval of PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, limit its commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.\nPTC-AADC is administered directly to the putamen in the brain using stereotactic surgery, a brain surgery requiring significant skill and training. There is little experience with such surgeries being used to deliver drugs and for such surgeries being performed on children. Delivery of PTC-AADC to the putamen also requires certain medical devices, which may result in our product candidate being deemed to be a combination product by FDA. This would potentially require additional development work and collaboration with medical device manufacturers, which may delay the submission of product candidate marketing applications and approval. It may also require compliance with certain of the FDA\u2019s medical device regulations. If we are unable to engage with and train sufficient brain surgeons to perform the procedure properly, the availability of PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency could be substantially diminished. The need to train brain surgeons to perform the procedures may also expose us to additional regulatory risks as our interactions with such healthcare providers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. For example, if PTC-AADC receives approval in the United States, such interactions would need to comply with FDA\u2019s laws and regulations on product promotion, as well as laws and regulations related to healthcare fraud and abuse. As a result, we will need to invest significant resources to ensure all personnel and contractors are adequately trained on these requirements and to monitor their conduct.\nAny contamination in our manufacturing process, shortages of raw materials or failure of any of our key suppliers to deliver necessary components could result in delays in our clinical development or marketing schedules and adversely affect our ability to meet our supply obligations.\nGiven the nature of biologics manufacturing, there is a risk of contamination. Any contamination could materially adversely affect our ability to produce our gene therapy product candidates on schedule and could, therefore, harm our results of operations and cause reputational damage.\nSome of the raw materials and other components required in our manufacturing process are derived from diverse biologic sources. Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may be subject to contamination or recall. A material shortage, supply chain disruption, including disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, contamination, recall or restriction on the use of biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our product candidates could adversely impact or disrupt the production of clinical material, which could materially and adversely affect our development and commercialization\ntimelines, including with respect to PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. Such requirements may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, and increase our development costs, or may force us to delay, limit, or terminate certain of our programs.\nWe may experience development problems related to our gene therapy programs that cause significant delays, changes in plans or unanticipated costs, or that cannot be solved. Although numerous companies are currently advancing gene therapy product candidates through clinical trials, to date, the FDA has only approved a limited number of gene therapy treatments, including vector-based gene therapies. In addition, there are also only limited gene therapy products for genetic diseases approved to date in the EU. As a result, it is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency or our other gene therapy product candidates in any jurisdiction, if at all. Regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products are still evolving and may continue to change in the future. For example, the FDA has issued a number of guidance documents on human gene therapy development. The FDA will likely continue to issue new guidance and replace existing guidance. The European Commission may also issue new guidelines concerning the development and marketing authorization for gene therapy medicinal products and require that we comply with these new guidelines. Regulatory review agencies and the new requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional or larger studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or restrictions. Moreover, while there are significant risks that accompany all development programs, because gene therapy products are a relatively new development, less is known about such products and product candidates. Accordingly, there is an increased risk that such products and product candidates may not perform in clinical or preclinical trials as we expect. Additionally, because gene therapy products are complex, the manufacture of such products and product candidates is more difficult and costly. We may not be able to reliably manufacture such products in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements in sufficient quantities to support our development programs and, if ultimately approved, commercial supply. Delay, failure or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring our product candidates to market, as well as manufacturing difficulties or challenges, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Even if we do obtain regulatory approval, ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy arising in the future could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting sale of our products.\nIn addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of such product candidates. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied product candidates.\nThe FDA has established the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise the CBER in its review; other international regulatory agencies have also dedicated personnel and/or offices to review gene therapy programs and products.\nThese regulatory review committees and advisory groups and any new guidelines they promulgate, as well as any unexpected results or manufacturing difficulties, may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance our gene therapy product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of certain of our product candidates. These additional requirements may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected.\nFor our gene therapy product candidates, we may also pursue alternative approval pathways. For instance, in the EU, we may pursue an exceptional circumstances marketing authorization. If a product candidate is eligible for the grant of a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances, the authorization would be subject to a requirement for the applicant to implement specific procedures, in particular related to notification of the competent authorities of any safety issue. Such exceptional circumstance marketing authorizations are annually reassessed and after five years, the authorization may be renewed under exceptional circumstances for an unlimited period, or the EMA may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. If any product we have is approved under the exceptional circumstances process, there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain such approval. Moreover, our product candidates may not be eligible for exceptional circumstances marketing authorization. By example, the product candidate may not fulfill the qualifying criteria or the EMA may determine that the marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may not be granted because a conditional marketing authorization is more appropriate. Orphan products are further eligible for approval under exceptional circumstances only if the criteria considered for the approval under exceptional circumstances are fulfilled.\nDelays as a result of lengthier regulatory approval process and further restrictions on development or the approval of our gene therapy product candidates can be costly and could negatively impact our or our collaborators\u2019 ability to complete clinical trials and commercialize our current and future product candidates in a timely manner, if at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur gene therapy product candidates and the process for administering such product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.\nThe goal of gene therapy is to be able to correct an inborn genetic defect through one-time administration of therapeutic genetic material containing non-defective gene copies. The gene copies are designed to reside permanently in a patient, allowing the patient to produce an essential protein or ribonucleic acid, or RNA, molecule that a healthy person would normally produce. There is a risk, however, that the new gene copies will produce too much or too little of the desired protein or RNA. There is also a risk that production of the desired protein or RNA will increase or decrease over time. Because the treatment is irreversible, there may be challenges in managing side effects, particularly those caused by overproduction. Adverse effects would not be able to be reversed or relieved by stopping dosing and might require us to develop additional clinical safety procedures. Furthermore, because the new gene copies are designed to reside permanently in a patient, there is a risk that they will disrupt other normal biological molecules and processes, including other healthy genes, and we may not learn the nature and magnitude of these side effects until long after clinical trials have been completed. Accordingly, long-term patient and clinical study subject follow up and associated regulatory reporting may be required for gene therapies to assess delayed adverse events.\nThere have been several significant adverse side effects in gene therapy treatments in the past, including reported cases of leukemia, immune- and complement-mediated responses, and death seen in other trials using other vectors. While new recombinant vectors have been developed to potentially reduce these side effects, gene therapy is still a relatively new approach to disease treatment and additional adverse side effects could develop. Accordingly, depending on the vector that is used, additional manufacturing, clinical, and preclinical testing may be required, as well as additional analyses, assessments, and potential long-term patient and clinical study subject monitoring and sample testing and associated regulatory reporting. There also is the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biologic activity of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material.\nPossible adverse side effects that could occur with treatment with gene therapy products include an immunologic or complement-mediated reactions early after administration which, while not necessarily adverse to the patient\u2019s health, could substantially limit the effectiveness of the treatment.\nIn addition to any potential side effects caused by any gene therapy product candidate, the administration process or related procedures also can cause adverse side effects. If any such adverse events occur, our clinical trials could be suspended, modified, or terminated or we may be required to interrupt or cease commercial sales of any product candidates that may receive regulatory approval. If in the future we are unable to demonstrate that such adverse events were caused by the administration process or related procedures, the FDA, the European Commission, the EMA or other regulatory authorities\ncould order us to cease further development of, or deny approval of, our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Even if we are able to demonstrate that all future serious adverse events are not product-related, such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial, as well as the receptivity of patients and physicians to try any approved gene therapy products. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other product candidates, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and prospects.\nFurthermore, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by any of our gene therapy product candidates, several potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw approvals of any product candidate that may receive regulatory approval, thereby preventing or delaying its commercialization;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require additional warnings or limitations of use in product labeling;\n\u25cf we may be required to change the way a product candidate is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for harm caused by our products to patients; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our gene therapy assets for which we receive marketing approval and could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur gene therapy approach utilizes vectors derived from viruses, which may be perceived as unsafe or may result in unforeseen adverse events. Negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene therapy may damage public perception of the safety of PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency or our other gene therapy product candidates and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for PTC-AADC or our other gene therapy product candidates.\nBecause gene therapy remains a novel technology, we face uncertainty as to whether gene therapy will gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, the commercial success of our product candidates will depend, in part, on the acceptance of physicians, patients and healthcare payers of gene therapy products in general, and of our product candidates in particular, as medically necessary, cost-effective and safe. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend in part upon physicians who specialize in the treatment of genetic diseases targeted by our product candidates, if approved, prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates, if approved, in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments, if any, with which they are familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. Even if a product candidate displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in clinical trials and is ultimately approved, market acceptance of the product candidate will not be fully known until after it is commercialized. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for any product candidates that receive regulatory approval. For example, earlier gene therapy trials conducted by other organizations have led to several well-publicized adverse events, including cases of leukemia, immune- and complement-mediated adverse events, and death seen in other such organizations\u2019 trials using other vectors. A significant negative development in any other gene therapy program or our failure to satisfy any post-marketing regulatory commitments and requirements to which we may become subject may adversely impact the commercial results and potential of our product candidates. Serious adverse events in our clinical trials, or other clinical trials involving gene therapy products or our competitors\u2019 products, even if not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any gene therapy products for which we obtain marketing approval. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products candidates, if approved, could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate product revenue.\nWe expect the cost of a single administration of gene therapy products, including PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, to be substantial. We expect that coverage and reimbursement by government and private payers will be essential for most patients to be able to afford these treatments. Accordingly, sales of any product candidates, if approved, will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the prices of such product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or will be reimbursed by government authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payers. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon several factors, including the availability of alternative therapies or a third-party payer\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u25cf a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u25cf safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u25cf appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u25cf cost-effective; and\n\u25cf neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement for a product from third-party payers is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to the payer supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products, including potential one-time gene therapies, such as PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency. In the United States, third-party payers, including government payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered and reimbursed. Expensive specialty drugs in particular are often subject to restriction. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payers and government payers develop their coverage and reimbursement policies. Currently, there is limited experience with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019, or CMS, coverage of gene therapy products. We cannot be assured that Medicare or Medicaid will cover our product candidates that may be approved or provide reimbursement without restriction and at adequate levels to realize a sufficient return on our investment. Our rebate payments may increase or our prices be adjusted under value-based purchasing arrangements based on evidence-based measures or outcomes-based measures for a patient or beneficiary based on use of our drug. Moreover, reimbursement agencies in the EU may be more conservative than CMS. It is difficult to predict what third-party payers will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Additionally, within Europe, each country has its own reimbursement regime employing various health technology assessment approaches to assess the cost-effectiveness of the product (in the United Kingdom a HTA assessment is conducted by NICE) which may significantly affect the effective access to the market.\nWe may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway or from separate full applications for approval.\nBiologics, including our gene therapy product candidates are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA. Biologics require the submission of a BLA and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. Historically, a biologic product approved under a BLA was not subject to the generic drug review and approval provisions of the FDCA. However, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created a regulatory pathway under the PHSA for the abbreviated approval of biological products that are demonstrated to be \u201cbiosimilar\u201d or \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with an FDA approved biological product. To demonstrate biosimilarity, the biosimilar sponsor must show that the product candidate is highly similar to the reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that there is no clinically meaningful difference between the biosimilar product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. In order to meet the standard of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than\nonce, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product.\nSuch biosimilars would reference biological products approved in the United States. The BPCIA, however, establishes certain protections for reference biologic products. For example, the BPCIA sets up a complex and involved framework for reference and biologic product sponsors to bring patent infringement actions and actions for declaratory judgment. If another company pursues approval of a product that is biosimilar to any biologic product for which we receive FDA approval, we may need to pursue costly and time-consuming patent infringement actions, which may include certain statutorily specified regulatory steps before an infringement action may be brought. We may also need to spend time and money defending an action for declaratory judgement that is brought by the biosimilar product sponsor.\nAnother protection established by the BPCIA is a period of 12 years of exclusivity for reference products that begins on the date that the reference product was first licensed by FDA. During this time, FDA may not make the licensure of a biosimilar product effective. Biosimilar applications can, however, be submitted for FDA review beginning four years after the date of the reference product\u2019s first licensure. Any of our product candidates that may be approved under BLAs in the future could be reference products for biosimilar marketing applications. As a result, any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval may face competition from other biological products that receive regulatory approval pursuant to an abbreviated pathway, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business, financial condition or prospects.\nIn addition, the biologic exclusivity period has certain limitations that may limit its ability to protect our product candidates, if approved, from biosimilar or interchangeable product competition. For example, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and certain subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the 12-year exclusivity period. Moreover, there have been legislative efforts to decrease this period of exclusivity to a shorter timeframe. Future proposed budgets, international trade agreements and other arrangements or proposals may affect periods of exclusivity. Further, even if our biologic product candidates qualify for the BPCIA\u2019s 12-year period of exclusivity, there is a risk that the FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. Additionally, this period of regulatory exclusivity does not apply to companies pursuing regulatory approval via their own traditional BLA, rather than via the abbreviated pathway. Accordingly, another company could market a competing version of a biological product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor\u2019s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet fully clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. It is also possible that payers will give reimbursement preference to biosimilars, even over reference biologics, absent a determination of interchangeability.\nSimilarly, in the EU, another company could gain approval for a competing product based on an MAA with a completely independent data package that includes pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.\nTo the extent we do not receive any anticipated periods of regulatory exclusivity or to the extent the FDA or ex-U.S. regulatory authorities approve any biosimilar, interchangeable, or other competing products, our business would be adversely impacted. Competition that our products may face from biosimilar, interchangeable, or other competing products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability, and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those product candidates. In the United States, this risk has increased in recent years as the FDA and the U.S. government have taken steps to encourage increased biosimilar competition in the market, in an effort to bring down the cost of biologic products.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates\nIf we are unable to continue to execute our commercial strategy for our products, fail to obtain renewal of, or satisfy the conditions of our marketing authorization for our products, or if we experience significant delays in accomplishing such goals, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources to bring our products to market through research and development, collaborations and acquisitions. Our ability to continue to generate product revenues will depend heavily on the successful commercialization of our products.\nAs we presently have no patent rights to protect the approved use of Emflaza, we rely on the market exclusivity periods currently available to us under the Orphan Drug Act to commercialize Emflaza for DMD in the United States. Failure to maintain the market exclusivity period, maintain our marketing authorization for Emflaza in the United States, or timely execute our commercialization plans for Emflaza, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWhile we have obtained marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA, such authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following the annual EMA reassessment as well as the specific obligation to conduct and submit the results of Study 041. For a review of recent developments that have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, please review the risk factor titled, \u201cACT DMD did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, and there is substantial risk that regulators will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\u201d\nWe and our collaborators are currently pursuing further clinical development efforts for our products for other indications. Each genetic disorder has unique genetic and pathophysiological characteristics and we believe that regulators, including the FDA and the EMA, will evaluate the effectiveness of such products for any given indication based on the merits of the clinical efficacy evidence available for such indication. However, because we are developing products for the treatment of multiple indications, there is a risk that negative results in a clinical or pre-clinical trial of a product for one indication, could adversely affect the perception of such product in a different indication. There can be no assurance that regulators, including the FDA and the EMA, will not consider such results when making determinations with respect to our ongoing or future regulatory submissions for marketing authorization of our products for any indication, including the FDA\u2019s Complete Response Letter to our NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and the EMA\u2019s annual reassessment of our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which could have an adverse effect on the outcome of the applicable regulatory review. There can be no assurance that regulators will agree with our interpretation of data from our clinical trials.\nIf we do not successfully maintain our marketing authorizations for our products, our ability to generate additional revenue will be jeopardized and, consequently, our business will be materially harmed. The success of our products will depend on a number of additional factors, including the following:\n\u25cf our ability to negotiate, secure and maintain adequate pricing, coverage and reimbursement terms on a timely basis, or at all;\n\u25cf the timing, scope and outcome of commercial launches;\n\u25cf the maintenance and expansion of a commercial infrastructure capable of supporting product sales, marketing and distribution;\n\u25cf the implementation and maintenance of marketing and distribution relationships with third parties in territories where we do not pursue direct commercialization;\n\u25cf our ability to establish and maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u25cf our ability or the ability of our third-party manufacturers to successfully produce commercial and clinical supply of drug on a timely basis sufficient to meet the needs of our commercial and clinical activities;\n\u25cf successful identification of eligible patients;\n\u25cf acceptance of the drug as a treatment for the approved indication by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u25cf effectively competing with other therapies;\n\u25cf global trade policies;\n\u25cf a continued acceptable safety profile of the drug;\n\u25cf the costs, timing and outcome of post-marketing studies and trials required for our products, including, with respect to Translarna, Study 041;\n\u25cf protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio, obtaining and maintaining regulatory exclusivity and, including with respect to Emflaza, whether we are able to maintain market exclusivity periods under the Orphan Drug Act;\n\u25cf whether, with respect to Translarna, we are able to continue to satisfy our obligations under, and maintain, the marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, including whether the EMA determines on an annual basis that the benefit-risk balance of Translarna supports renewal of our marketing authorization in the EEA, on the current approved label;\n\u25cf whether, and within what timeframe, we are able to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States, including, whether we will be required to perform additional clinical trials, non-clinical studies or CMC assessments or analyses at significant cost which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA submission by us and, ultimately, may support approval of Translarna for nmDMD in the United States;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain additional and maintain existing reimbursed named patient and cohort EAP programs for our products on adequate terms;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully prepare and advance regulatory submissions for marketing authorizations for our products in additional territories and for additional or expanded indications and whether and in what timeframe we may obtain such authorizations;\n\u25cf the ability and willingness of patients and healthcare professionals to access our products through alternative means if pricing and reimbursement negotiations in the applicable territory do not have a positive outcome; and\n\u25cf protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to continue to commercialize our products, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe marketing authorization granted by the European Commission for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is limited to ambulatory patients aged two years and older located in the EEA, which significantly limits an already small treatable patient population, which reduces our commercial opportunity and is also subject to annual reassessment of the benefit-risk balance by the EMA as well as the specific obligation to conduct Study 041, and may be varied, suspended or withdrawn by the European Commission if we fail to satisfy those requirements.\nWe have obtained orphan drug designations from the EMA and from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD because the number of patients who could benefit from treatment with Translarna is small. The marketing label approved by the European Commission further limits the currently treatable patient population to ambulatory nmDMD patients aged two years and older who have been identified through genetic testing as having a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene. Prevalence estimates for rare diseases are uncertain due to the uncertainties associated with the methodologies used to derive estimates, such as epidemiology assumptions. It can take many years of experience in rare disease market places before prevalence becomes well characterized. Our estimates of both the number of people who have DMD caused by a nonsense mutation, as well as the subset of people with nmDMD who are ambulatory and at least two years old (and, therefore, satisfy the conditions for treatment under our current product label in the EEA), are based on our beliefs and estimates derived from a variety of sources and may prove to be either incorrect or subject to additional refinement or characterization on a country specific basis over the coming years. Prevalence estimates vary given some degree of variation in the incidence of live male births, the incidence of DMD, the incidence of nonsense mutations and other factors. Information concerning the eligible patient population is generally limited to certain geographies and may not employ definitive measures capable of establishing with precision the actual number of nmDMD patients in such geography. If the market opportunities for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD are smaller than we believe they are, our business and anticipated revenues will be negatively impacted. If we decide to seek to expand the approved product label of\nTranslarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the future, the timing of, and our ability to generate, the necessary data or results required to obtain expanded regulatory approval is currently uncertain. Given the small number of patients who have nmDMD, and the smaller number of patients who meet the criteria for treatment under our current marketing authorization, our commercial opportunity is limited. It is critical to the commercial success of Translarna for nmDMD that we successfully identify and treat these patients.\nIn order to continue to generate revenue from Translarna, we must maintain our marketing authorizations in the EEA and Brazil for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged two years and older, maintain our marketing authorization for Translarna in Russia for the treatment of nmDMD in patients aged two years and older and we also may need to receive or maintain marketing authorizations in other territories. The marketing authorization in the EEA is conditional and subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment, as well as the specific obligation to complete and report the results of Study 041 to the EMA. We expect that as part of the annual EMA assessment, the EMA will consider the ongoing status of Study 041. We expect results from the placebo-controlled trial of Study 041 to be available in mid-2022. We then expect to submit a report on the placebo-controlled trial and the open-label extension data from Study 041 that has been collected to date to the EMA by the end of the third quarter of 2022, as required. The marketing authorization was last renewed in June 2021 and is effective, unless extended, through August 5, 2022. In February 2022, we submitted a marketing authorization renewal request to the EMA.\nIf the EMA determines in any annual renewal cycle that the balance of benefits and risks of using Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD has changed materially or that we have not or are unable to comply with any conditions that have been or may be placed on the marketing authorization, the European Commission could, at the EMA\u2019s recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna or require the imposition of other conditions or restrictions. As such, there is ongoing risk to our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA.\nIf we are unable to renew our marketing authorization in the EEA during any annual renewal cycle, or if our product label is materially restricted, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna, whether pursuant to a commercial or an EAP program, and in all territories, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Products and our Product Candidates\u201d below for further detail regarding conditional marketing authorizations in the EEA.\nDelays or failures in obtaining regulatory approval in the United States, may prevent us from commercializing Translarna for nmDMD in that territory and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. In the event that the FDA requires us to conduct additional clinical trials in nmDMD which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA submission by us, we would expect to incur significant costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we filed our Translarna NDA for nmDMD with the FDA via the \u201cfile over protest\u201d process that allows a company to have its NDA filed and reviewed when there is a disagreement with regulators over the acceptability of the NDA submission. In October 2017, the Office of Drug Evaluation I of the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the NDA, stating that it was unable to approve the application in its current form. In response, we filed a formal dispute resolution request with the Office of New Drugs of the FDA. In February 2018, the Office of New Drugs of the FDA denied our appeal of the Complete Response Letter. In its response, the Office of New Drugs recommended a possible path forward for the ataluren NDA submission based on the accelerated approval pathway. This would involve a re-submission of an NDA containing the current data on effectiveness of ataluren with new data to be generated on dystrophin production in nmDMD patients\u2019 muscles. We followed the FDA\u2019s recommendation and collected, using newer technologies via procedures and methods that we designed, such dystrophin data in a new study, Study 045, and announced the results of Study 045 in February 2021. Study 045 did not meet its pre-specified primary endpoint. We expect results from the placebo-controlled trial of Study 041 to be available in mid-2022, and subject to a positive outcome in that study, we expect to re-submit the NDA.\nThere is significant risk that we will be unable to obtain FDA approval of Translarna for nmDMD, on a timely basis or at all, and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials, non-clinical studies or CMC assessments or analyses at\nsignificant cost. Even if we are able to enroll and fund any such additional trials or studies or complete such assessments or analyses, there is substantial risk that the results would not ultimately support the approval of a re-submission of an NDA in the United States for Translarna for nmDMD. In addition, any such requirement for additional trials would most likely result in our inability to sell Translarna in the United States for a significant period of time, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD.\nWe may pursue the accelerated approval pathway for Translarna, pending the results of Study 041. However, the FDA may determine that Translarna does not qualify for accelerated approval. Moreover, even if we do ultimately receive approval for Translarna in the United States, if such approval is via the accelerated approval pathway, we will need to complete a post-approval study confirming Translarna\u2019s clinical benefit. This study would likely require substantial time, effort, and funds. Furthermore, if Translarna is ultimately approved through the accelerated approval pathway, we would be subject to additional regulatory requirements, such as the pre-submission of promotional materials to FDA and potential restrictions, such as distribution restrictions, to assure the product\u2019s safe use. Accelerated approval would also subject us to the risk of expedited FDA withdrawal procedures if we do not conduct required post-approval studies, such studies do not meet FDA\u2019s standards, such studies do not confirm the product\u2019s clinical benefit, or FDA finds that any post market restrictions are inadequate to assure the safe use of the product, among other circumstances. In recent years, the accelerated approval pathway has come under significant FDA and public scrutiny. Accordingly, depending on the results of our studies, the FDA may be more conservative in granting accelerated approval or, if granted, may be more apt to withdrawal approval if clinical benefit is not confirmed. Due to these and other uncertainties, we are unable to estimate the timing or potential for a launch of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States or the cost or effort required to receive FDA approval for Translarna and meet FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements both before and after approval. Even if we receive approval for Translarna, there is no guarantee that we would be able to maintain such approval.\nThe FDA has repeatedly disagreed with our interpretation of the study results for Translarna. In 2010, we filed a NDA for ataluren based on our Phase 2b clinical data, which the FDA refused to file. We filed a formal dispute resolution request concerning this decision in 2011 and, in 2012, the FDA reaffirmed its previous decision to refuse to file the 2010 NDA.\nIn October 2015, we announced that the primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population did not achieve statistical significance in ACT DMD. On the basis of our position that the totality of clinical data from ACT DMD and our prior Phase 2b trial support the clinical benefit of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, in December 2015, we submitted our analyses of the ACT DMD data and meta-analysis of the combined ACT DMD and Phase 2b subgroup data to the FDA, as part of our NDA, after commencing our submission on a rolling basis in December 2014.\nOn February 22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the FDA stating that our NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review in particular because, in the view of the FDA, both the Phase 2b and Phase 3 ACT DMD trials were negative and do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness and that our NDA does not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of Translarna. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. In addition, the FDA noted that our NDA does not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of Translarna. While other comments and requests were noted in the letter as items to be addressed if the NDA were to be resubmitted, the FDA specified that they were not related to its refusal to file our NDA.\nFollowing the refusal to file of our NDA, we initiated dialogue with the FDA to discuss and clarify the matters set forth in the letter and determine our best path forward. In accordance with the formal dispute resolution process that exists within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research of the FDA, we filed a formal appeal of the Refuse to File letter, which was denied in October 2016. In the first quarter of 2017, we filed our Translarna NDA for nmDMD via the FDA\u2019s file over protest regulations. We included additional retrospective and post hoc analyses from our clinical trials with the NDA filed in 2017, including analyses of the 6-minute walk test using alternative statistical and analytical methods and new analyses from the North Star Ambulatory Assessment test, a functional scale designed for boys affected by DMD. Filing over protest is a procedural path permitted by FDA regulations that allows a company to have its NDA filed and reviewed when there is a disagreement with regulators over the acceptability of the NDA submission.\nIn its 2016 Refuse to File letter and in its 2017 Complete Response Letter and its denial of our appeal to the Complete Response Letter, the FDA referenced its prior refusal to file relative to the Phase 2b data and our early discussions with the FDA, reiterating the views previously expressed.\nACT DMD did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, and there is substantial risk that regulators will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\nIn October 2015, we announced that the primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population did not achieve statistical significance in ACT DMD. We submitted our analyses of the ACT DMD data and meta-analyses of the combined ACT DMD and Phase 2b subgroup data to the EMA to support continuation of our marketing authorization in the EEA, which is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization. The EMA and European Commission did not approve our request for full marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and, instead, approved the annual renewal of our marketing authorization with the specific obligation to confirm the efficacy and safety of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients age 5 years or older via Study 041.\nEnrolling, conducting and reporting a clinical trial is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we have incurred and expect to continue to incur material costs related to the implementation and conduct of Study 041. We expect that conducting a placebo-controlled trial in nmDMD of this size will be challenging and we have enrolled patients in countries with a different standard of care for nmDMD patients and at clinical trial sites that are inexperienced with nmDMD clinical trials, which may affect our ability to accurately evaluate the study and maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and laws. In addition, we may experience unknown complications with Study 041 and may not achieve the pre-specified endpoint with statistical significance, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA.\nThere is substantial risk that other regulators in regions where we have not yet sought or are currently seeking marketing authorization will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in those applicable territories. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or obtain marketing authorizations in areas where such authorizations are contingent upon decisions of the EMA with respect to our marketing authorization in the EEA.\nFor additional information, see \u201cRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Products and our Product Candidates\u201d below.\nIf clinical trials of our products or our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the EMA, the FDA or other regulators, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our products or product candidates.\nIn connection with seeking marketing authorization from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical and preclinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. This is especially true for rare and/or complicated diseases. A failure of one or more clinical or preclinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Preclinical and clinical studies may reveal unfavorable product candidate characteristics, including safety concerns, or may not demonstrate product candidate efficacy. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies\nthat have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing authorization of their products.\nWith respect to Translarna, the primary efficacy endpoint in the intent to treat, or ITT, population did not achieve statistical significance in the Phase 2b (completed in 2009) or Phase 3 ACT DMD (completed in 2015) clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. For a review of recent developments that have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, please review the risk factor titled, \u201cACT DMD did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, and there is substantial risk that regulators will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\u201d\nIf the FDA, the EMA and other regulators do not agree with our interpretation of the results of the clinical data from our trials, and, when and if completed, Study 041 and related analyses, or otherwise do not view the results of these trials as favorable; if we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our products or product candidates that we develop beyond those that we contemplate; if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing; if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive; or if there are safety concerns, we may, among other things:\n\u25cf be unable to successfully maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which is subject to annual review and renewal following reassessment of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization by the EMA;\n\u25cf be unable to successfully maintain our marketing authorization in Brazil or Russia for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u25cf be unable to successfully maintain our marketing authorization in other countries that we have received approval for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u25cf be delayed in or unable to obtain marketing approval in the United States for Translarna or any other product candidates, including supplemental application approvals for any products that receive approval;\n\u25cf be delayed in obtaining additional marketing authorizations, or not obtain additional marketing authorizations at all, for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u25cf be delayed in obtaining marketing authorizations, or not obtain marketing authorizations at all, for our other product candidates;\n\u25cf obtain approval for indications, uses or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u25cf obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u25cf obtain approval with labeling that does not include claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of the product or product candidate;\n\u25cf be subject to additional post-marketing requirements or restrictions, such as post-approval studies or REMS;\n\u25cf have the product removed from markets after obtaining applicable marketing authorizations; or\n\u25cf not be permitted to sell Translarna under some or any reimbursed EAP programs.\nIf we or our collaborators experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with clinical trials related to our products or our product candidates, maintenance of our existing marketing authorization for our products and any additional potential marketing authorization or commercialization of our products or our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nWe or our collaborators may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing authorization or commercialize our products or our product candidates, including:\n\u25cf clinical trials of our products or our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results for the necessary study endpoints, our studies may fail to reach the necessary level of statistical significance, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u25cf there may be flaws in our clinical trials\u2019 design that may not become apparent until the clinical trials are well advanced or regulators may not agree with the design of our studies or our analysis of the resulting data;\n\u25cf the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product and product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or be lost to follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u25cf clinical trial sites or enrolled patients may be negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in delays and disruptions in completing clinical trials, such as the delays we have experienced in enrolling our registration-directed Phase 2/3 placebo-controlled trial of vatiquinone in children with mitochondrial disease associated seizures trial as some patients have been unable or hesitant to travel to clinical trial sites due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf patients that enroll in our studies may misrepresent their eligibility or may otherwise not comply with the clinical trial protocol, resulting in the need to drop the patients from the study, increase the needed enrollment size for the study or extend the study\u2019s duration;\n\u25cf we may be unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials to ensure adequate statistical power to detect any statistically significant treatment effects;\n\u25cf we may enroll patients at clinical trial sites in countries that are inexperienced with clinical trials in general, or with the indication that is the subject of the trial;\n\u25cf we may enroll patients at clinical trial sites in countries that have a different standard of care for patients in general, or with respect to the indication that is the subject of the trial. Regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, may also not accept data generated at international clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or we may be required to engage in additional clinical trial site monitoring;\n\u25cf regulators, institutional review boards, institutional biosafety committees, or independent ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site or may require us to submit additional data, conduct additional studies or amend our investigational new drug application, or IND, or comparable application or protocols prior to commencing a clinical trial;\n\u25cf we may fail to reach an agreement with regulators, institutional review boards, institutional biosafety committees, or independent ethics committees regarding the scope, design, or implementation of our clinical trials. For instance, the FDA or comparable ex-U.S. regulatory authorities may require changes to our study design that make further study impractical or not financially prudent;\n\u25cf we may have delays in reaching or may fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites and contract research organizations;\n\u25cf we may have delays in adding new investigators or clinical trial sites, or we may experience a withdrawal of clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf we may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our products or our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf regulators, institutional review boards, institutional biosafety committees, or independent ethics committees may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf the cost of clinical trials of our products or our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate or we may have insufficient funds for a clinical trial or to pay the substantial user fees required by the FDA upon the filing of a marketing application;\n\u25cf the supply or quality of our products or our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our products or our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\u25cf our products or our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators, institutional review boards, institutional biosafety committees or independent ethics committees to suspend or terminate the trials;\n\u25cf regulators may require us to perform additional or unanticipated clinical or preclinical trials, develop additional manufacturing information, or make changes to our manufacturing process to obtain approval or we may be subject to additional post-marketing testing, surveillance, or REMS requirements to maintain regulatory approval;\n\u25cf there may be changes in the applicable regulatory authorities\u2019 approval policies or review, statutes, or regulations, which may render our data insufficient to obtain marketing approval;\n\u25cf we may decide that it is no longer in our business interest to continue a development program;\n\u25cf there may be regulatory questions or disagreements regarding interpretations of data and results, or new information may emerge regarding our product candidates;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable ex-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree with our study design, including endpoints, or our interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials or find that a product candidate\u2019s benefits do not outweigh its safety risks;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities may disagree with our intended indications;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable ex-U.S. regulatory authorities may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes for clinical and future commercial supplies, the Hopewell Facility or our contract manufacturer\u2019s manufacturing facility;\n\u25cf the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable ex-U.S. regulatory authorities to support the submission of a marketing application, or other comparable submission in ex-U.S. jurisdictions or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities may take longer than we anticipate to make a decision on our product candidates; or\n\u25cf we may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate provides an advantage over current standards of care or current or future competitive therapies in development.\nFor example, the Phase 2 Moonfish study, which was evaluating the safety and efficacy of RG7800 under our SMA collaboration, was terminated in December 2016 following a suspension and clinical hold in the first half of 2015 to investigate an eye finding in a 39-week study in cynomolgus monkeys. The suspension and termination of Moonfish resulted in unanticipated delays in the advancement of the SMA program.\nOur product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing authorizations, and we may not have sufficient funding to complete the testing and approval process for any of our product candidates. We may be required to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials and prepare for possible commercialization of our products and product candidates. We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our products or our product candidates and allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, or impair our ability to successfully commercialize our products or our product candidates, and so may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur conclusions regarding the activity and potential efficacy of Translarna in nmDMD are primarily based on retrospective, subgroup and meta-analyses of the results of our Phase 2b and ACT DMD clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Other than with respect to certain of our meta-analyses, results of our analyses are expressed as nominal p-values, which are generally considered less reliable indicators of efficacy than adjusted p-values. In addition, retrospective analyses are generally considered less reliable than pre-specified analyses.\nAfter determining that we did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint with the pre-specified level of statistical significance in our completed ACT DMD and Phase 2b clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, we performed subgroup, retrospective, and meta-analyses. We submitted these analyses to the FDA as part of our NDA, taking the position that the totality of clinical data from these trials support the clinical benefit of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In addition, after determining that the primary efficacy endpoint did not achieve statistical significance in ACT DMD or our Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, we performed retrospective and subgroup analyses that we believe provide sufficient support for concluding that Translarna was active and showed clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in these trials.\nWe believe that our reliance upon the additional analyses of the results of these trials was warranted, but the FDA typically does not find a retrospective analysis performed after unblinding trial results to be persuasive because it can result in the introduction of bias if the analysis is inappropriately tailored or influenced by knowledge of the data and actual results.\nSome of our favorable statistical data from these trials also are based on nominal p-values that reflect only one particular comparison when more than one comparison is possible. Typically, a trial result is interpreted as being statistically significant if the chance of the same result occurring with the placebo is less than one in 20, resulting in a p-value of less\nthan 0.05. Nominal p-values cannot be compared to the typical significance level (p-value less than 0.05) to determine statistical significance without adjusting for the testing of multiple dose groups, end points or analyses of subgroups. Because of these limitations, regulatory authorities typically give greater weight to results from pre-specified analyses and adjusted p-values and less weight to results from post-hoc, retrospective analyses and nominal p-values. A p-value is considered nominal if it is the result of one particular comparison prior to any pre-specified multiplicity adjustment, such as when two active treatments are compared to placebo or when two or more subgroups are analyzed. For example, the p-values in ACT DMD for change from baseline at week 48 in the 6-minute walk test, or 6MWT (which we also refer to as 6-minute walk distance, or 6MWD) and each secondary end point timed function test in the pre-specified subgroup of patients with a baseline 300-400 meter 6MWD had p-values of less than 0.05. The FDA considered these p-values to be nominal because of the sequential testing method we used.\nOn February 22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File, or RTF, letter from the FDA stating the FDA\u2019s opinion that both the Phase 2b and Phase 3 ACT DMD trials were negative and did not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness and that our NDA did not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of Translarna. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. Our reliance on nominal p-values for some of our statistical data and our use of retrospective analyses had a negative impact on the FDA\u2019s interpretation of the results of our Phase 2b trial, ACT DMD and the totality of the data from our clinical trials. The FDA reiterated this view in the Complete Response Letter that it sent to us in October 2017 and its denial of our appeal of that letter.\nOur reliance on nominal p-values for some of our statistical data and our use of retrospective analyses has also had a negative impact on the EMA\u2019s evaluation of a prior application for continued marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, including delays in timing of the CHMP\u2019s opinion with respect to the annual renewal of our marketing authorization, and could negatively impact regulatory determinations by regulators in other territories with respect to new or existing authorizations.\nAn unfavorable view of our data and analyses by the FDA and EMA for Translarna has and could continue to negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain authorizations to market Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. An inability to obtain new marketing authorizations or maintain our current marketing authorization in the EEA would have a material adverse effect on our revenue from Translarna and would materially harm our business, financial results and results of operations.\nBecause we are developing products and product candidates for the treatment of diseases in which there is little clinical experience and, in some cases, using new endpoints or methodologies, there is increased risk that the outcome of our clinical trials will not be favorable.\nThere are no marketed therapies approved to treat the underlying cause of nmDMD. In addition, there has been limited historical clinical trial experience generally for the development of drugs to treat nmDMD and other diseases that we are studying or have studied. As a result, the design and conduct of clinical trials for these diseases, particularly for drugs to address the underlying nonsense mutations causing these diseases in some subsets of patients, is subject to increased risk.\nFor example, on March 2, 2017, we announced that the primary and secondary endpoints were not achieved in ACT CF, our Phase 3 clinical trial for Translarna in nmCF. As a result, we discontinued our clinical development of Translarna for nmCF at that time.\nPrior to the Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for nmDMD, there was no precedent of an established trial design to evaluate the efficacy of Translarna in nmDMD over a 48 week duration. In addition, clinical understanding of the methodologies used to analyze the resulting data were also limited. The study design and enrollment criteria for ACT DMD were based on available natural history data of the disease, including third-party data and results from our Phase 2b clinical trial. An evolving understanding in the DMD community has led to a greater appreciation of the optimal window for the 6MWT in assessing physical function. We believe that this factor may have led to the primary efficacy endpoint in the intent to treat population not achieving statistical significance in ACT DMD.\nAdditionally, following the FDA\u2019s recommendation to collect dystrophin data using validated quantification methods, we initiated Study 045 to evaluate the ability of ataluren to increase dystrophin protein levels in boys with nmDMD. Study 045 did not meet its pre-specified primary endpoint.\nWe faced similar challenges in connection with the designs of our study of Translarna in nonsense mutation aniridia, which did not meet statistical significance, our study of Translarna in nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5, which did not meet its primary endpoint and our study in Emflaza in limb-girdle 2I. In each case, there was limited historical clinical trial experience for the development of drugs to treat the underlying cause of these disorders. Our program for Emflaza in limb-girdle 2I was discontinued in 2019 and our programs for Translarna in nonsense mutation aniridia and Translarna in nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5 were each discontinued in 2020.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates, including clinical trials related to our splicing, gene therapy, Bio-e, metabolic and oncology programs and studies of emvododstat for COVID-19 as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, label extensions and additional indications.\nMany of the indications we are currently pursuing for our products and product candidates are characterized by relatively small patient populations, which could result in slow enrollment of clinical trial participants. In addition, our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates. As a result, potential clinical trial sites may elect to dedicate their limited resources to participation in our competitors\u2019 clinical trials and not ours, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates. For example, there is significant competition, including from other companies and governmental organizations, to find treatments for COVID-19 which may affect the patient enrollment of our studies of emvododstat for COVID-19.\nPatient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u25cf severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u25cf perceived benefits and risks of the product candidate under study;\n\u25cf disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf the willingness of potential patients to enroll in a clinical trial during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u25cf patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u25cf the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u25cf proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nFor example, we have experienced delays in enrolling our registration-directed Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vatiquinone in children with mitochondrial disease associated seizures as some patients have been unable or hesitant to travel to clinical trial sites due to the COVID-19 pandemic and we now anticipate results from this trial to be available in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates. Our inability to enroll, timely or at all, a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials for our splicing, gene therapy, Bio-e, metabolic and oncology programs and studies of emvododstat for COVID-19 as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, label extensions and additional indications, or any of our, or our collaboration partners\u2019, other clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nIf serious adverse side effects are identified during the development or further development of any product candidate or for any product for which we have or may obtain marketing approval, including Translarna and Emflaza, we may need to abandon or limit our development and/or marketing of that product or product candidate.\nOur products and product candidates are in clinical or preclinical development, or further development, and their risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. If our products or our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, regulatory authorities, institutional review boards, institutional biosafety committees, or independent ethics committees may place our studies on clinical hold, withdraw or suspend study approvals, or require that we modify our protocols. We may also need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a benefit-risk perspective. Adverse events or side effects may also result in regulatory authorities denying approval of any applications we may submit for marketing approval, limitations on the indicated use of a product, the inclusion of warnings, contraindications, or precautions on the label of any approved products, or significant conditions imposed on any approval, including the requirement of a REMS, costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety of the product. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound.\nFor example, although we did not observe a pattern of liver enzyme elevations in our Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials of Translarna, we did observe modest elevations of liver enzymes in some subjects in one of our Phase 1 clinical trials. These elevated enzyme levels did not require cessation of Translarna administration, and enzyme levels typically normalized after completion of the treatment phase. We did not observe any increases in bilirubin, which can be associated with serious harm to the liver, in the Phase 1 clinical trial.\nIn addition, in Study 009, our first Phase 3 clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF, five adverse events in the Translarna arm of the trial that involved the renal system led to discontinuation. As compared to the placebo group, the Translarna treatment arm also had a higher incidence of adverse events of creatinine elevations, which can be an indication of impaired kidney function. In the Translarna treatment arm, more severe clinically meaningful creatinine elevations were reported in conjunction with cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations. These creatinine elevations were associated with concomitant treatment with antibiotics associated with impaired kidney functions, such as aminoglycosides or vancomycin. This led to the subsequent prohibition of concomitant use of Translarna and these antibiotics, which was successful in addressing this issue in the clinical trial.\nIn addition, we may be obligated to perform certain FDA post-marketing requirements in connection with any product approvals that we may receive. If we or others identify previously unknown side effects, whether pursuant to these post-marketing requirements, or otherwise, and in particular if such side-effects are severe, or if known side effects are more frequent or severe than in the past then our marketing authorizations may be restricted or withdrawn, changes may be required to the product\u2019s label, sales may be adversely impacted, we may be required to undertake additional studies or trials, and government investigations or litigation, including product liability claims, may be brought against us. Additionally, if the safety warnings in our product labels are not followed, adverse medical situations in patients may arise, resulting in negative publicity and potential lawsuits, even if our products worked as we described. Any of these occurrences would limit or prevent us from commercializing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations.\nOur product candidates, including our gene therapy product candidates, may be subject to marketing and distribution restrictions that could limit our ability to successfully market and distribute those products, and limit the ability of physicians to prescribe and administer such products.\nOur product candidates, including our gene therapy product candidates, if approved, may be subject to restrictions on product labeling, marketing, distribution, prescribing, and use, which could increase our cost to commercialize such products and decrease our ability to generate product revenue. One such restriction may be risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the product\u2019s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the product, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the product. Several gene\ntherapy products that have been approved by FDA have required substantial REMS. If any of our product candidates are subject to REMS, it may require a significant investment in time and funds to implement such REMS and may harm our results of operation.\nAny of our products or any other product candidate that receives marketing authorization, if any, may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nAlthough Translarna is currently authorized by the EMA for marketing for the treatment of nmDMD, such marketing authorization is subject to the specific obligation to conduct and submit the results of Study 041 to the EMA and is also subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization by the EMA. Even if our marketing authorization in the EEA and other territories where we currently have approval for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is maintained, or we are successful in obtaining marketing authorization for Translarna for other indications or territories, such product may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. In addition, Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States or any of our other products or product candidates that receive marketing authorization, may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. Third-party payors may require prior authorizations or failure on another type of treatment before covering a particular drug, particularly with respect to higher-priced drugs. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for a product or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product could reduce physician usage of the product, including Emflaza or Translarna. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or any profits from operations.\nThe degree of market acceptance of our products or product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf the limitations or warnings contained in the product\u2019s FDA-approved labeling;\n\u25cf the claims we may make for a product, based on the approved label;\n\u25cf distribution and use restrictions imposed by the FDA with respect to such product candidates or to which we agree as part of a REMS or voluntary risk management plan;\n\u25cf the ability to offer our products or product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\n\u25cf convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u25cf the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u25cf sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement;\n\u25cf adverse publicity about our products or product candidates or favorable publicity about competitive products or product candidates; and\n\u25cf any restrictions on concomitant use of other medications.\nIn addition, because we are developing Translarna for the treatment of different indications, negative results in a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of Translarna for one indication, could have a negative impact on the perception of the efficacy of Translarna in a different indication, which could have an adverse effect on our commercialization efforts and financial results.\nOur ability to negotiate, secure and maintain third-party coverage and reimbursement may be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments in the United States, the EU, Latin America and other jurisdictions. Governments continue to impose cost containment measures, and third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. These and other similar developments could significantly limit the degree of market acceptance of our products or any of our other product candidates that receive marketing authorization.\nWe face risks related to the development of emvododstat as a potential treatment for COVID-19 and we may ultimately be unsuccessful in developing a treatment for the virus in a timely manner or at all. Even if we are able to produce a drug that successfully treats the virus, there is significant competition in the search for a treatment for COVID-19 and our product would not be the only commercially available treatment.\nIn June 2020, the FDA authorized the initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating emvododstat as a potential treatment for COVID-19 and we expect results from this trial to be available in the first half of 2022. Our clinical trial for emvododstat may reveal unfavorable characteristics, including safety concerns, and may not demonstrate efficacy. We cannot be certain that the Phase 2/3 clinical trial will be sufficient to enable us to obtain marketing approval of emvododstat for the treatment of COVID-19, and we may need to conduct additional clinical trials before we are able to apply for marketing approval. Additionally, the FDA and other regulators may not agree with our interpretation of the results of the clinical data from the trial. If we are unable to successfully complete the clinical trial, if the results of the clinical trial are not positive or are only modestly positive, or if there are safety concerns, we may be unable to produce a drug that successfully treats COVID-19 and receives regulatory approval in a timely manner, if at all.\nThe timing and success of our clinical trial of emvododstat for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 will depend on our ability to enroll patients in the trial. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients could result in significant delays or could require us to abandon the trial and development of emvododstat for the treatment of COVID-19 altogether. Patient enrollment may be affected by the availability of commercially available treatments and vaccines and other ongoing clinical trials. There is significant competition, including from other companies and governmental organizations, to find a treatment for COVID-19. For example, the FDA has approved the use of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines and authorized the use of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. The FDA has approved Gilead\u2019s antiviral drug Velkury (remdesivir) for the treatment of COVID-19. The FDA has also granted emergency use authorizations to Merck\u2019s molnupiravir, Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets, co-packaged for oral use) and monoclonal antibodies, among other products, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. As a result, even if we are able to sufficiently enroll our clinical trial and produce an effective treatment for COVID-19, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully commercialize our product. For additional information, see the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates\u201d titled, \u201cIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\u201d\nIf we are unable to establish or maintain sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market, sell and distribute our products or product candidates, we may not be successful in our continuing efforts to commercialize our products or any other product candidate if and when they are approved.\nOur ongoing commercial strategy for our products and any other product candidate that may receive marketing authorization involves the development of a commercial infrastructure that spans multiple jurisdictions and is heavily dependent upon our ability to continue to build an infrastructure that is capable of implementing our global commercial strategy. The establishment and development of our commercial infrastructure will continue to be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to develop our commercial organizations in all intended territories, including in the United States, in a timely manner or at all. Doing so will require a high degree of coordination and compliance with laws and regulations in numerous territories, including in the United States, each state, and other countries in which we do business, including restrictions on advertising practices, enforcement of intellectual property rights, restrictions on pricing or discounts, transparency laws and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs. If we are unable to effectively coordinate such activities or comply with such laws and regulations, our ability to commercialize our products or any other product candidates that may receive marketing authorization in the United States, the EEA, Latin America and other jurisdictions will be adversely affected. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue consistent with our expectations and may not become profitable.\nThere are risks involved with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training an internal commercial team is expensive and time consuming and could delay commercialization efforts. If a commercial launch for any product or product candidate for which we recruit a commercial team and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason,\nwe would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition such personnel.\nThe arrangements that we have entered into, or may enter into, with third parties to perform sales and marketing services will generate lower product revenues or profitability of product revenues to us than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively.\nIf we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products or product candidates.\nFactors that may materially affect our efforts to commercialize our products include:\n\u25cf our ability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf our ability to monitor the legal and regulatory compliance of sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf an inability to secure adequate coverage and reimbursement by government and private health plans;\n\u25cf reduced realization on government sales from mandatory discounts, rebates and fees, and from price concessions to private health plans and pharmacy benefit managers necessitated by competition for access to managed formularies;\n\u25cf the clinical indications for which the products are approved and the claims that we may make for the products;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the products\u2019 approved labeling;\n\u25cf any distribution and use restrictions imposed by the FDA or to which we agree as part of a mandatory REMS or voluntary risk management plan;\n\u25cf liability for sales or marketing personnel who fail to comply with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf our ability to implement third-party marketing and distribution relationships on favorable terms, or at all, in territories where we do not pursue direct commercialization;\n\u25cf the ability of our commercial team to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our current or any future products;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary products to be offered by our commercial team, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent commercial organization.\nAny of these factors, individually or as a group, if not resolved in a favorable manner may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Similar risks apply in those territories where any of our products are available on a reimbursed basis under an EAP program.\nA substantial portion of our commercial sales currently occurs in territories outside of the United States which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe commercialize Translarna, Tegsedi and Waylivra outside of the United States. We have operations in multiple European countries, Latin America and other territories. We expect that we will continue to expand our international operations in the future, including in emerging growth markets, pending successful completion of the applicable regulatory processes. International operations inherently subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf various effects and responsive measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf political, regulatory, compliance and economic developments that could restrict our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products;\n\u25cf financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable and exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf difficulty in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u25cf potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u25cf changes in international medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in healthcare policies of ex-U.S. jurisdictions;\n\u25cf trade protection measures, including import or export licensing requirements and tariffs;\n\u25cf our ability to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies;\n\u25cf political and economic instability in particular ex-U.S. economies and markets, in particular in emerging markets, for example in Brazil;\n\u25cf diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the United States;\n\u25cf differing labor regulations and business practices; and\n\u25cf regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 and service providers\u2019 activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act or similar local regulation.\nFor example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Brazilian Ministry of Health is continuing to experience significant delays processing centralized group purchase orders. Almost all of our product revenue for Translarna in Brazil is attributable to such purchase orders. These centralized group purchase order delays have caused, and may continue to cause, fluctuations in our ability to generate revenue in Brazil.\nIn addition, some countries in which a product candidate is not approved allow patients access to the product candidate through other legal mechanisms, including court intervention or EAP programs, if the product is approved in another jurisdiction. The price that is ultimately approved by governmental authorities in any country pursuant to commercial pricing and reimbursement processes may be significantly lower than the price we are able to charge for sales under such legal mechanisms and we may become obligated to repay such excess amount. For additional information, see also \u201cRisks Related to the Regulation of our Products and our Product Candidates\u201d-\u201cCommercialization of Translarna has been in, and is expected to continue to take place in, countries that tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues. Failure to obtain and maintain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and other countries where Translarna is available would delay or prevent us from marketing our product in such regions, which would adversely affect our anticipated revenue, growth and business.\u201d\nSome of the countries in which our products are available for sale are in emerging markets. Some countries within emerging markets, including those in Latin America, may be especially vulnerable to periods of global or regional financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on. We also may be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents within less developed markets. In addition, many emerging market countries have currencies that fluctuate substantially and if such currencies devalue and we cannot offset the devaluations, our financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, in some countries, including Russia, orders for named patient sales may be for multiple months of therapy, which can lead to an unevenness in orders which could result in significant fluctuations in quarterly net product sales. Other factors may also contribute to fluctuations in quarterly net product sales including a product\u2019s availability in any particular territory, government actions, economic pressures, political unrest and other factors. Net product sales are impacted by factors, such as the timing of decisions by regulatory authorities, in particular the FDA and the EMA with respect to our ability to market or sell Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, and our ability to successfully negotiate favorable pricing and reimbursement processes on a timely basis in the countries in which we have or may obtain regulatory approval, including the United States, EEA and other territories.\nAny of these factors may, individually or as a group, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As we continue to expand our existing international operations, we may encounter new risks.\nLaws and regulations governing export restrictions and economic sanctions may preclude us from developing and selling certain products, generating revenue from such products, and manufacturing certain materials outside of the United States.\nMany countries, including the United States, restrict the export or import of products to or from certain countries through, for example, bans, sanction programs, and boycotts. Such restrictions may preclude us from supplying products or generating revenue in certain countries or may require an export license prior to the export of the controlled item. Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. Furthermore, if we, or third parties acting on our behalf, do not comply with these restrictions, we may be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting.\nOur activities outside of the United States, require that we dedicate resources to comply with these laws. Many of our customers and suppliers are ex-U.S. entities or have significant ex-U.S. operations. Although these restrictions have not affected our operations in the past, there is a risk that they could do so in the future as additional geographic regions and entities may become subject to such restrictions. The imposition of new or additional economic and trade sanctions against our major customers or suppliers or financial counterparties or intermediaries could result in our inability to sell to, and generate revenue from such customers or purchase materials from such suppliers. For example, we make sales of Translarna through a distributor to the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation to access Russian nmDMD patients. Our ability to generate and realize revenue in Russia may be materially and adversely impacted as many countries, including the United States, consider imposing enhanced export controls on certain products and sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. We also contract with government-owned hospitals and third-party manufacturers located in China, which has recently been involved in political conflict with the United States. This conflict has increased the likelihood of restrictions that could materially and adversely affect our clinical trial sites located in China and our ability to obtain certain supplies. If our activities are affected because of these or other such restrictions, sanctions, or controls, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a result of restrictive export laws, our customers may also seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current products and product candidates and any products we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. Other gene therapy companies may in the future decide to utilize existing technologies to address unmet needs that could potentially compete with our product candidates.\nThere is currently no marketed therapy, other than Translarna in the EEA, which has received approval for the treatment of the underlying cause of nmDMD. Sarepta recently received approval in the United States for two treatments (Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) and Vyondys 53 (golodirsen)) addressing the underlying cause of disease for different mutations in the DMD gene. Additionally, the FDA granted accelerated approval to Viltepso (viltolarsen) from NS Pharma for the treatment of DMD in patients with exon 53 skipping and Sarepta (Casimersen (SRP 4045) for the treatment of DMD in patients with exon 45 skipping. Viltepso (viltolarsen) from NS Pharma is also approved in Japan. Other biopharmaceutical companies are developing treatments for the underlying cause of disease for different mutations in the DMD gene, Daiichi Sankyo (DS-5141), Nippon Shinyaku (Viltolarsen (NS-065/NCNP-01) and NS-089/NCNP-02), and Astellas (AT-702). Other pharmaceutical companies are developing micro dystrophin gene therapies for patients with DMD regardless of genotype, including Sarepta (SRP-9001), Pfizer (PF-06939926) and Solid Biosciences (SGT-001).\nAlthough the FDA has not approved a corticosteroid specifically for DMD in the United States other than Emflaza, we face competition in the U.S. DMD market from prednisone/prednisolone, which, while not approved for DMD in the United States, is generically available and has been prescribed off label for DMD patients. ReveraGen BioPharma and Santhera are developing a glucocorticoid antagonist (vamorolone) for DMD patients with anticipated NDA filing in 2022.\nEvrysdi also faces competition. For example, in December 2016, the FDA approved Spinraza (nusinersen), a drug developed by Ionis and marketed by Biogen, to treat SMA. Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec), a gene therapy drug\ndeveloped by AveXis, Inc. (acquired by Novartis in 2018) is approved in the United States and Japan for the treatment of SMA in patients under 2 years of age and in Europe for babies and young children who weigh up to 21 kilograms. Other companies are also pursuing product candidates for the treatment of SMA, including Kowa (sodrium valproate), Catalyst Pharmaceuticals (amifampridine), Scholar Rock (SRK-015), Roche Pharmaceuticals (RO7204239) and Cytokinetics (reldesemtiv).\nThere are several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in the development or commercialization of products against targets that are also targets of Tegsedi and Waylivra. For example, if approved, Waylivra could face competition from drugs like Myalept (metreleptin). Myalept, produced by Novelion Therapeutics, Inc., is currently approved for use in generalized lipodystrophy patients. Additionally, Ionis is developing AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx for the treatment of FCS. Tegsedi also faces competition from drugs like Onpattro (patisiran), which was launched by Alnylam in the United States in 2018 and received approval in Brazil for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in 2020. Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) and Vyndamax (tafamidis) are commercialized in the United States, EU and some other countries in Latin America by Pfizer. Other companies are also pursing product candidates for the treatment of ATTR Amyloidosis with polyneuropathy including Alnylam (vutrisiran), BridgeBio Pharma (AG-10), Proclara Biosciences (NPT-189), Prothena (PRK-004) and SOM Biotech (tolcapone).\nFurther, Tegsedi and Waylivra are delivered by injection, which may render them less attractive to patients than non-injectable products offered by our current or future competitors. If Tegsedi or Waylivra cannot compete effectively with these and other products with common or similar indications, we may not be able to generate substantial revenue from our product sales.\nCurrently, no treatment options are available for the underlying cause of AADC deficiency, and care is limited to palliative options with significant burden on caregivers. Additionally, we are not aware of any late-stage development product candidates for AADC deficiency.\nThere are currently no drugs approved to delay the onset or slow the progression of Huntington\u2019s disease. However, Novartis (branaplam), uniQure (AMT-130), Roche and Ionis (tominersen) and Wave Life Sciences (WVE-003) are all developing product candidates for treatment of Huntington disease.\nWhile there are currently no disease modifying treatment options available for Friedreich ataxia, omaveloxolone, which is being developed by Reata Pharmaceuticals and RT-001, which is being developed by Retrotope, are each late stage product candidates being investigated for the treatment of Friedreich ataxia.\nThere are no disease modifying drugs approved for the treatment of mitochondrial disease associated seizures and we are not aware of any late-stage development product candidates for mitochondrial disease associated seizures.\nCurrent standard of care for ALS is Rilutek (riluzole), currently available as a generic and other formulations, and Radicava (edaravone). Amylyx Pharmaceuticals (AMX-0035) has submitted an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to EMA. There are multiple other late stage product candidates being developed for the treatment of ALS including Ionis (Jacifusen), Clene Nanomedicine (CNM-Au8), MediciNova (Ibudilast), AB Science (AB-1010 mastinib mesylate), and Prilenia Therapeutics (Pridopidine).\nIf approved, PTC923 could face competition from Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride), including generic versions, and Palynziq (pegvaliase-pqpz), each of which is approved for the treatment of PKU. Furthermore, Homology (HMI-102) and BioMarin (BMN 307) each are developing gene therapy product candidates for the treatment of PKU.\nIf approved, emvododstat for COVID-19 could face significant competition as many other companies and governmental organizations have expended resources to find a treatment for COVID-19. The FDA has approved the use of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines and authorized the use of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. The FDA has approved Gilead\u2019s antiviral drug Velkury (remdesivir) for the treatment of COVID-19. The FDA has also granted emergency use authorizations to Merck\u2019s molnupiravir, Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets, co-packaged for oral use) and monoclonal antibodies, among other products, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.\nFirst line treatment for LMS is surgery where appropriate and then chemotherapy options including doxorubicin, gemcitabine, dacarbazine and docetaxel for unresectable metastatic disease. For second line treatment, two drugs are approved for soft tissue sarcoma including LMS and these are Yondelis (trabectedin) and Votrient (pazopanib). Most LMS patients require multiple lines of therapy.\nThere is no approved treatment for DIPG and very little improvement have been observed over the past 40 years. The current standard of care is radiation therapy which can shrink the tumor, though response is transient.\nOur competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are marketing or developing or that would render our products or product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also obtain marketing authorization for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products and product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nWe believe that many competitors are attempting to develop therapeutics for the target indications of our products and product candidates, including academic institutions, government agencies, public and private research organizations, large pharmaceutical companies and smaller more focused companies.\nMany of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs.\nOur products or product candidates may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nWe may not obtain adequate coverage or reimbursement for our products or we may be required to sell our products at an unsatisfactory price. In addition, obtaining pricing, coverage and reimbursement approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we do not receive these approvals on a timely basis.\nThe regulations and practices that govern marketing authorizations, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries, including almost all of the member states of the EEA, require approval of the sale (list) price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some ex-U.S. markets, including the European market, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing authorization for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations, in some countries at national as well as regional levels, that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more products, including Emflaza and Translarna, or other product candidates, even following marketing authorization.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products or product candidates that may receive marketing authorization will depend in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, managed healthcare organizations and other third-party payors and organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and managed healthcare organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement conditions and rates. A primary trend in the EU and U.S. healthcare industries and elsewhere is cost containment.\nGovernment authorities, including the United States government and state legislatures, and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Prices at which our products are reimbursed can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with discounts off the products\u2019 sale (list) prices and are challenging the prices manufacturers charge for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product or product candidate that we may commercialize and, if coverage is available, the level of reimbursement is also uncertain.\nReimbursement levels may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product or product candidate for which we obtain marketing authorization. Obtaining reimbursement for Emflaza and for Translarna has been and is expected to continue to be, particularly difficult due to price considerations typically associated with drugs that are developed to treat conditions that affect a small population of patients. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict requirements for reimbursement of a higher priced drug, such as prior authorization and the requirement to try other therapies first, or high co-payments which can result in patient rejection. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for a product or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product could reduce physician usage of the product, including Emflaza or Translarna. If reimbursement is not available or is available only on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product or product candidate for which we have obtained or may obtain marketing authorization, including Emflaza or Translarna.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the drug\u2019s approved indications as determined by the applicable regulatory authority. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent, and programs intended to provide patient assistance until coverage is established can be very costly. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Further, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nNet prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws, enforcement policies or administrative determinations with respect to the importation of drugs into the United States from other countries where they may be sold at lower prices.\nIn the United States, third-party payors include federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and Veterans Health Administration programs; managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Several of the U.S. federal healthcare programs establish ceiling prices or require that drug manufacturers extend discounts or pay rebates to certain programs in order for their products to be covered and reimbursed. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of covered outpatient drugs to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the federal government as a condition for coverage of the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drug(s) by state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is based on a statutory formula and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. State Medicaid programs and Medicaid managed care plans can seek additional \u201csupplemental\u201d rebates from manufacturers in connection with states\u2019 establishment of preferred drug lists. A further requirement for Medicaid coverage is that manufacturers of single source and innovator multiple source drugs enter into a Master agreement and Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, agreement with the Secretary for Veterans Affairs and charge no more than statutory ceiling prices to the Department of Veteran Affairs, the Department of Defense and certain other federal agencies.\nSimilarly, in order for a covered outpatient drug to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs, the manufacturer must extend discounts on the covered outpatient drug to entities that are enrolled and participating in the 340B drug pricing program, which is a federal program that requires manufacturers to provide discounts to certain statutorily-defined safety-net providers. The 340B discount for each product is calculated based on certain Medicaid Drug Rebate Program metrics that manufacturers are required to report to CMS.\nEmflaza is also eligible for reimbursement under the Medicare Part D program. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities, which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D prescription drug formularies are required to include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain, and payment of Medicare Coverage Gap discounts may further reduce realization on Part D drugs. Further, CMS is proposing to relax Part D coverage requirements to give plans more leverage in negotiating their formularies.\nWith respect to drugs eligible for reimbursement under Medicare Part B, on November 27, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing a Most Favored Nations payment model under which reimbursement for certain Medicare Part B drugs and biologicals will be based on a price that reflects the lowest per capita Gross Domestic Product-adjusted (GDP-adjusted) price of any non-U.S. member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a GDP per capita that is at least sixty percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. This rule now has been rescinded but similar programs are the subject of current legislative proposals. Such rules and any additional healthcare reform measures could further constrain our business or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in additional pricing pressures.\nIn addition, U.S. private health insurers often rely upon Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. Any such coverage or payment limitations may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. Payment by private payors is also subject to payor-determined coverage and reimbursement policies that vary considerably and are subject to change without notice. We expect that coverage and reimbursement of Emflaza in the United States will vary from commercial payor to commercial payor. Many commercial payors, such as managed care plans, manage access to prescription drugs partly to control costs to their plans, and may use drug formularies and medical policies to limit their exposure. Exclusion from policies can directly reduce product usage in the payor\u2019s patient population and may negatively impact utilization in other payor plans, as well.\nThere has been recent negative publicity and increasing legislative and public scrutiny around pharmaceutical drug pricing in the U.S., in particular with respect to orphan drugs and specifically with respect to Emflaza. Moreover, U.S. government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate drug prices and reimbursement, often with particular focus on orphan drugs. These dynamics may give rise to heightened attention and potential negative reactions to pricing decisions for Emflaza and products for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future, possibly limiting our ability to generate revenue and attain profitability.\nMoreover, in 2017, the U.S. Congress modified and amended certain provisions of the 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, known collectively as the Affordable Care Act), which could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by the federal and state healthcare programs as well as plans in the private health insurance market. The so-called \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed as part of tax reform legislation adopted in December 2017. Legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act continue to arise and there may be future efforts to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The Biden administration is expected to continue to take measures to further facilitate the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We cannot assure that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nAdditionally, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. Failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to reach required deficit reduction goals triggered the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year. While President Biden previously signed legislation to eliminate this reduction through the end of 2021, recent legislation will restart the reductions, which will thereafter remain in effect through 2031 unless additional congressional action is taken.\nIn the EU, reference pricing systems and other measures may lead to cost containment and reduced prices with respect to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and other product candidates that might receive marketing authorization in the\nfuture. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for our product or any of our product candidates that may receive marketing authorization, or a reduction in coverage for payment rates for our product or any such product candidates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in the EU, an authorized trader, such as a wholesaler, can purchase a medicine in one EU member state and obtain a license to import the product into another EU member state. This process is called \u201cparallel distribution\u201d. As a result, a purchaser in one EU member state may seek to import Translarna from another EU member state where Translarna is sold at a lower price. This could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth.\nSimilarly, sales of Emflaza in the United States could also be reduced if deflazacort is imported into the United States from lower-priced markets, whether legally or illegally. For example, in the United States, prices for pharmaceuticals are generally higher than in the bordering nations of Mexico and Canada. There have been proposals to legalize the import of pharmaceuticals from outside the United States and the FDA has finalized a guidance to facilitate the import of U.S. approved pharmaceutical and biologic products that were originally intended for marketing in a foreign country. If such legislation were enacted, our revenues from Emflaza could be reduced, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and based on our current commercial, research and development plans, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future. We may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $2,098.0 million. We have historically financed our operations primarily through the issuance and sale of our common stock in public offerings, our \u201cat the market offerings\u201d of our common stock, our initial public offering, proceeds from the Royalty Purchase Agreement, the private placements of our preferred stock, collaborations, bank and institutional lender debt, grant funding and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates. Since 2014, we have also relied on revenues generated from net sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States, and since May 2017, we have generated revenue from net sales of Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States. We have also relied on revenue associated with milestone and royalty payments from Roche pursuant to the SMA License Agreement under our SMA program. We also began to recognize revenue generated from net sales of Tegsedi for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis in 2019 and Waylivra for the treatment of FCS in 2020 in Latin America and the Caribbean. Based on our current commercial, research and development plans, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future, which we anticipate will be partially offset by revenues generated from the sale of our products and our collaboration and royalty revenues. We expect to continue to generate operating losses through 2022 and, while we anticipate that operating losses generated in future periods should decline versus prior periods, we may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nFrom time to time, we have engaged in strategic transactions to expand and diversify our product pipeline, including through the acquisition of assets or businesses. In connection with these acquisitions, we have entered into agreements through which we have ongoing obligations, including obligations to make contingent payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and net sales milestones or upon a percentage of net sales of certain products. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Our Ongoing Acquisition-Related Obligations\u201d for further information regarding our acquisitions and our ongoing obligations. We may engage in additional strategic transactions to expand and diversify our product pipeline, including through the acquisition of assets, businesses, or rights to products, product candidates or technologies or through strategic alliances or collaborations and we may incur expenses, including with respect to transaction costs, subsequent development costs or any upfront, milestone or other payments or other financial obligations associated with any such transaction.\nOur current ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna is dependent upon our ability to maintain our marketing authorizations in the EEA and Brazil of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged two years\nand older and in Russia for the treatment of nmDMD in patients aged two years and older. The marketing authorization in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization and is further subject to a specific obligation to conduct and report the results of Study 041, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, 18-month, placebo-controlled trial, followed by an 18-month open-label extension, according to an agreed protocol, in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Translarna. Enrolling, conducting and reporting a clinical trial is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we expect that we will incur material costs related to the implementation and conduct of Study 041. We may experience unknown complications with Study 041 and may not achieve the pre-specified endpoint with statistical significance, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA.\nIf, in any annual renewal cycle, the EMA determines that the balance of benefits and risks of using Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD has changed materially or that we have not or are unable to comply with the specific obligation to complete Study 041 or any other requirement that has been or may be placed on the marketing authorization, the European Commission could, at the EMA\u2019s recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna or impose other specific obligations or restrictions, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business. We expect to incur significant costs in connection with our efforts to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA. If our marketing authorization in the EEA is not renewed, or our product label is materially restricted, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna, whether pursuant to a commercial or a reimbursed early access program, or EAP program, and throughout all territories. For additional information, see the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Products and our Product Candidates\u201d titled, \u201cOur marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is a \u201cconditional marketing authorization\u201d that requires annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization and is further conditioned upon our ability to satisfy the specific obligation to conduct and report results from Study 041 by the end of the third quarter of 2022, and, as such, there is ongoing risk that we may be unable to maintain such authorization. If we are unable to obtain renewal of such marketing authorization in any future renewal cycle, we could lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna, whether pursuant to a commercial or an EAP program, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\u201d\nWe also expect that our efforts to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States will be time-consuming and may be expensive. For additional information, see the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates\u201d titled, \u201cDelays or failures in obtaining regulatory approval in the United States, may prevent us from commercializing Translarna for nmDMD in that territory and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. In the event that the FDA requires us to conduct additional clinical trials in nmDMD which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA submission by us, we would expect to incur significant costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\u201d\nWe anticipate that our expenses will continue to increase in connection with our commercialization efforts in the United States, the EEA, Latin America and other territories, including the expansion of our infrastructure and corresponding sales and marketing, legal and regulatory, distribution and manufacturing and administrative and employee-based expenses. In addition to the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with ongoing, planned and potential future clinical trials and studies in our splicing, gene therapy, Bio-e, metabolic and oncology programs and studies of emvododstat for COVID-19 as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, including Study 041, label extensions and additional indications. We have begun seeking and intend to continue to seek marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the EEA, Brazil and Russia. We submitted an MAA to the EMA for the treatment of AADC deficiency with PTC-AADC in the EEA. We are also preparing a BLA for PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States and we anticipate submitting a BLA to the FDA in the second quarter of 2022. We filed for marketing authorization with ANVISA for Waylivra for the treatment of FPL and we expect a regulatory decision on approval from ANVISA in the second half of 2022. These efforts may significantly impact the timing and extent of our commercialization expenses.\nIn addition, the clinical and regulatory developments noted in this risk factor may exacerbate the risks related to our commercialization efforts set forth under the heading \u201cRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates,\u201d which could increase the costs associated with our commercial activities or have a\nnegative impact on our revenues. For additional information, see also \u201cRisks Related to the Regulation of our Products and our Product Candidates\u201d \u201cCommercialization of Translarna has been in, and is expected to continue to take place in, countries that tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues. Failure to obtain and maintain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and other countries where Translarna is available would delay or prevent us from marketing our product in such regions, which would adversely affect our anticipated revenue, growth and business.\u201d\nWe may seek to continue to expand and diversify our product pipeline through opportunistically in-licensing or acquiring the rights to products, product candidates or technologies and we may incur expenses, including with respect to transaction costs, subsequent development costs or any upfront, milestone or other payments or other financial obligations associated with any such transaction, which would increase our future capital requirements.\nWith respect to our outstanding 3.00% convertible senior notes due August 15, 2022, or the 2022 Convertible Notes, cash interest payments are payable on a semi-annual basis in arrears, which will require total funding of $4.5 million annually. The 2022 Convertible Notes will mature on August 15, 2022 and we will be required to pay any outstanding principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes at that time, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date. As of February 15, 2022, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or any combination thereof at our election. With respect to our outstanding 1.50% convertible senior notes due September 15, 2026, or the 2026 Convertible Notes, cash interest payments are payable on a semi-annual basis in arrears, which will require total funding of $4.3 million annually. In addition, we expect to pay Marathon a single $50.0 million sales-based milestone in connection with Emflaza sales in 2022. We also expect to pay the former equityholders of Agilis an aggregate of $70.0 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones in 2022 relating to PTC-AADC.\nIn addition, our expenses will increase if and as we:\n\u25cf seek to satisfy contractual and regulatory obligations we assumed in connection with our acquisitions and collaborations;\n\u25cf execute our commercial strategy for our products, including initial commercialization launches of our products, label extensions or entering new markets;\n\u25cf are required to complete any additional clinical trials, non-clinical studies or CMC assessments or analyses in order to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25cf are required to take other steps, in addition to Study 041, to maintain our current marketing authorization in the EEA, Brazil and Russia for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or to obtain further marketing authorizations for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or other indications;\n\u25cf utilize the Hopewell Facility to manufacture program materials for certain of our gene therapy product candidates;\n\u25cf initiate or continue the research and development of our splicing, gene therapy, Bio-e, metabolic and oncology programs and our studies of emvododstat for COVID-19 as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, including Study 041, label extensions and additional indications;\n\u25cf seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n\u25cf seek to expand and diversify our product pipeline through strategic transactions;\n\u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u25cf add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts.\nOur ability to generate profits from operations and become and remain profitable depends on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize drugs that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including:\n\u25cf commercializing and marketing all of our products and products candidates;\n\u25cf negotiating, securing, and maintaining adequate pricing, coverage and reimbursement terms, on a timely basis, with third-party payors for our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf maintaining the marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA, including successfully obtaining annual renewals of the marketing authorization, fulfilling the specific obligation to conduct and report the results of Study 041 to the EMA, and meeting any ongoing requirements related to the marketing authorization;\n\u25cf advancing Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States, including, whether we will be required to perform additional clinical trials, non-clinical studies or CMC assessments or analyses at significant cost which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA re-submission by us and, ultimately, may support approval of Translarna for nmDMD in the United States;\n\u25cf maintaining orphan exclusivity in the United States for Emflaza;\n\u25cf successfully completing any post-marketing requirements imposed by regulatory agencies with respect to our products;\n\u25cf expanding the territories in which we are approved to market our products;\n\u25cf successfully advancing our other programs and collaborations, including our splicing, gene therapy, Bio-e, metabolic and oncology programs and studies of emvododstat for COVID-19 as well as studies in our products for additional indications;\n\u25cf maintaining a global commercial infrastructure, including the sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to effectively market and sell our products and product candidates throughout the world;\n\u25cf implementing marketing and distribution relationships with third parties in territories where we do not pursue direct commercialization;\n\u25cf identifying patients eligible for treatment with our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf successfully developing or commercializing any product candidate or product that we may in-license or acquire;\n\u25cf protecting our rights to our intellectual property portfolio related to Translarna and other products and product candidates; and\n\u25cf contracting for the manufacture and distribution of commercial quantities of our products and product candidates.\nWe may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to generate profits from operations. Even if we do generate profits from operations, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to generate profits from operations and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in our company.\nWe may need additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nAs noted in the prior risk factor, we expect to incur significant expenses related to our clinical, regulatory, commercial, legal, research and development, and other business efforts. We believe that our cash flows from product sales, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, including our Convertible Notes offerings, public offerings of common stock, our \u201cat the market offering\u201d of our common stock pursuant to an At the Market Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, or the Sales Agreement, proceeds from the Royalty Purchase Agreement and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf our ability to commercialize and market our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf our ability to negotiate, secure and maintain adequate pricing, coverage and reimbursement terms, on a timely basis, with third-party payors for our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain the marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, including whether the EMA determines on an annual basis that the benefit-risk balance of Translarna supports renewal of our marketing authorization in the EEA, on the current approved label;\n\u25cf the timing and outcome of Study 041;\n\u25cf the costs, timing and outcome of our efforts to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States, including, whether we will be required to perform additional clinical trials, non-clinical studies or CMC assessments or analyses at significant cost which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA re-submission by us and, ultimately, may support approval of Translarna for nmDMD in the United States;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain orphan exclusivity in the United States for Emflaza;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully complete any post-marketing requirements imposed by regulatory agencies with respect to our products;\n\u25cf the progress, results and costs of our activities under our splicing, gene therapy, Bio-e, metabolic and oncology programs and studies of emvododstat for COVID-19 as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, label extensions and additional indications;\n\u25cf the scope, costs and timing of our commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, legal, regulatory, distribution and manufacturing, for our products and for any of our other product candidates that may receive marketing authorization or any additional indications or territories in which we receive authorization to market our products;\n\u25cf our ability to utilize the Hopewell Facility to manufacture program materials for certain of our gene therapy product candidates;\n\u25cf the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our other product candidates, including those in our splicing, gene therapy, Bio-e, metabolic and oncology programs and studies of emvododstat for COVID-19 as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, label extensions and additional indications;\n\u25cf our ability to satisfy our obligations under the indentures governing our Convertible Notes;\n\u25cf the timing and scope of growth in our employee base;\n\u25cf revenue received from commercial sales of or products or any of our other product candidates;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain additional and maintain existing reimbursed named patient and cohort EAP programs for our products and product candidates on adequate terms, or at all;\n\u25cf the ability and willingness of patients and healthcare professionals to access our products and product candidates through alternative means if pricing and reimbursement negotiations in the applicable territory do not have a positive outcome;\n\u25cf the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property-related claims;\n\u25cf the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products, product candidates, and technologies, including the success of any acquisition, in-licensing or other strategic transaction we may pursue, and the costs of subsequent development requirements and commercialization efforts, including with respect to our acquisitions of Emflaza, Agilis, Censa and of BioElectron\u2019s assets, and our licensing of Tegsedi and Waylivra; and\n\u25cf our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, including our collaborations with Roche and the SMA Foundation, and our ability to obtain research funding and achieve milestones under these agreements.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales for certain product candidates or indications. In addition, our products and product candidates, if approved, may not achieve sustained commercial success. Likewise, if we fail to maintain our marketing authorization or lose non-patent market exclusivity for our products and product candidates, we will be unable to commercialize and generate revenue from the sales of those products.\nAccordingly, we may need to continue to rely on additional financing in connection with our continuing operations and to achieve our business objectives. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or based on strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions to acquire assets, businesses, or rights to products, product candidates or technologies or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt, or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may engage in additional strategic transactions to expand and diversify our product pipeline, including through the acquisition of assets, businesses, or rights to products, product candidates or technologies or through strategic alliances or collaborations, similar to our acquisitions of Emflaza, Agilis, Censa and BioElectron\u2019s assets and the Tegsedi-Waylivra Agreement. We may not identify suitable strategic transactions, or complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential opportunities that are never completed or we may incorrectly judge the value or worth of such opportunities. Even if we successfully execute a strategic transaction, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction, may incur additional debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith, and may experience losses related to our investments in such transactions. Integration of an acquired company or assets into our existing business may not be successful and may disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. Even if we are able to achieve the long-term benefits of a strategic transaction, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity. Any of the foregoing could have a detrimental effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, future strategic transactions may entail numerous operational, financial and legal risks, including:\n\u25cf incurrence of substantial debt, dilutive issuances of securities or depletion of cash to pay for acquisitions;\n\u25cf exposure to known and unknown liabilities, including possible intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, tax liabilities and commercial disputes;\n\u25cf higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u25cf difficulty in integrating operations and personnel of any acquired business;\n\u25cf increased amortization expenses or, in the event that we write-down the value of acquired assets, impairment losses;\n\u25cf impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership;\n\u25cf inability to retain personnel, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners integral to an in-licensed or acquired product, product candidate or technology;\n\u25cf potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges;\n\u25cf entry into indications or markets in which we have no or limited direct prior development or commercial experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; and\n\u25cf other challenges associated with managing an increasingly diversified business.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage any strategic transaction in which we may engage, our ability to develop new products and continue to expand and diversify our product pipeline may be limited.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate enough product revenues to cover our expenses, we expect to supplement our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates; marketing, distribution, licensing or other arrangements.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders\u2019 ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include\ncovenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, entering into agreements involving licenses to our intellectual property, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates; or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes to offset potential taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is subject to limitation under the provisions of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code as a result of ownership changes of the Company and could be subject to further annual limitations under such provisions. In addition, we may not generate sufficient future taxable income to use our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes.\nIf a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Sections 382 and 383, the corporation\u2019s ability to utilize any net operating losses, or NOLs, and certain tax credits and other tax attributes generated before such an ownership change, is limited. We believe that we have in the past experienced ownership changes within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 that have resulted in limitations under Sections 382 and 383 (and similar state provisions) on the use of our NOLs and other tax attributes.\nSections 382 and 383 are extremely complex provisions with respect to which there are many uncertainties, and we have not requested a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, to confirm our analysis of the ownership change limitations related to the NOLs and other tax attributes generated by us. Therefore, we have not established whether the IRS would agree with our analysis regarding the application of Sections 382 and 383. We continue to fully evaluate the impact of a limitation on the use of our NOLs and other tax attributes under Sections 382 and 383.\nMoreover, our ability to use these NOLs to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income. In 2021, we generated NOLs which will be carried forward.\nChanges in our effective income tax rates and future changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the Unites States and various ex-U.S. jurisdictions. Taxes will be incurred as income is earned in these different jurisdictions. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, the accounting for stock options and other share-based compensation, changes in accounting standards, future levels of research and development spending, changes in the mix and level of pre-tax earnings by taxing jurisdiction, the outcome of examinations by the IRS and other jurisdictions, the accuracy of our estimates for unrecognized tax benefits, the realization of deferred tax assets, or by changes to our ownership or capital structure. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above-mentioned factors and others may be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations, including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), may increase tax uncertainty and the amount of tax we pay.\nAs part of Congress\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, or FFCR Act, was enacted on March 18, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020, COVID relief provisions were included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, or CAA, which was enacted on December 27, 2020, and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, or ARPA, was enacted on March 11, 2021. All contain numerous tax provisions. In particular, the CARES Act retroactively and temporarily (for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021) suspends application\nof the 80%-of-income limitation on the use of NOLs, which was enacted as part of the 2017 Tax Act. It also provides that NOLs arising in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021 are generally eligible to be carried back up to five years. The CARES Act also temporarily (for taxable years beginning in 2019 or 2020) relaxes the limitation of the tax deductibility for net interest expense by increasing the limitation from 30% to 50% of adjusted taxable income.\nRegulatory guidance under the 2017 Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, the FFCR Act, the CARES Act, the CAA, and the ARPA is and continues to be forthcoming, and such guidance could ultimately increase or lessen the impact of these laws on our business and financial condition. It is also possible that Congress will enact additional legislation in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result of the changes in the U.S. presidential administration and control of the U.S. Senate, additional tax legislation may also be enacted.\nAlthough we monitor actual and potential changes to the tax laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, it is very difficult to assess to what extent these changes may impact the way in which we conduct our business or our effective tax rate due to the unpredictability and interdependency of these changes. Changes in tax laws and related regulations and practices could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, cash flows, effective tax rate, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Products and our Product Candidates\nOur marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is a \u201cconditional marketing authorization\u201d that requires annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization and is further conditioned upon our ability to satisfy the specific obligation to conduct and report results from Study 041 by the end of the third quarter of 2022, and, as such, there is ongoing risk that we may be unable to maintain such authorization. If we are unable to obtain renewal of such marketing authorization in any future renewal cycle, we could lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna, whether pursuant to a commercial or an EAP program, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\nConditional marketing authorizations based on incomplete clinical data, including our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, may be granted in the EEA for a limited number of listed medicinal products for human use, including products designated as orphan medicinal products under EU law, if (1) the EMA determines that the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations or conditions, including with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be specified in the conditional marketing authorization. Conditional marketing authorizations are only valid for one year, and must be renewed annually by the European Commission after an assessment by the EMA of the ongoing positive benefit-risk balance in favor of continued authorization and the need for additional or modified conditions.\nWe received initial marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older from the European Commission in August 2014 as a \u201cconditional marketing authorization.\u201d In July 2018, the European Commission approved a label-extension request to our marketing authorization for Translarna in the EEA to include patients from two to up to five years of age. In July 2020, the European Commission approved the removal of the statement \u201cefficacy has not been demonstrated in non-ambulatory patients\u201d from the indication statement for Translarna. The marketing authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization and is further conditioned upon our satisfaction of the specific obligation to conduct and submit results from Study 041 by the end of the third quarter of 2022 to the EMA. We expect that as part of the annual EMA assessment, the EMA will consider the ongoing status of Study 041. We are also required to implement measures, including pharmacovigilance plans, which are detailed in the risk management plan.\nOur marketing authorization was previously conditioned upon our submission to the EMA of the final efficacy and safety report from ACT DMD during 2015. Although we have fulfilled the condition to submit the ACT DMD report to the EMA, that trial did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline at week 48 in distance walked in the 6-minute walk test. The EMA and European Commission did not approve our request for full marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and, instead, approved the renewal of our conditional marketing authorization with the specific obligation to confirm the efficacy and safety of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged 5 years or older via Study 041.\nEnrolling, conducting and reporting a clinical trial is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we expect that we will incur material costs related to the implementation and conduct of Study 041. We expect that conducting a placebo-controlled trial in nmDMD of this size will be challenging and we have enrolled patients in countries with a different standard of care for nmDMD patients and at clinical trial sites that are inexperienced with nmDMD clinical trials, which may affect our ability to accurately evaluate the study and maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and laws. In addition, we may experience unknown complications with Study 041 and may not achieve the pre-specified endpoint with statistical significance, which would have a materially adverse effect on our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA.\nIf we fail to satisfy our obligations under the marketing authorization, or if it is determined in any annual renewal cycle that the balance of benefits and risks of using Translarna has changed materially, the European Commission could, at the EMA\u2019s recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna. The EMA may also impose other new conditions to our marketing authorization (in addition to Study 041), and may make other recommendations, including new label restrictions. In the event that we do secure annual renewal of the marketing authorization for any given annual renewal cycle, the EMA could nevertheless later determine that we have not complied, or are unable to comply, with any conditions that have been or may be placed on the marketing authorization, including those related to Study 041, which could result in the withdrawal of our marketing authorization or other outcome that would have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our marketing authorization in the EEA is not renewed, or our product label is materially restricted, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna, whether pursuant to a commercial or an EAP program and throughout all territories, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to comply with applicable laws and regulations for our products or product candidates, we will not be able to obtain or maintain product approvals and commercialize our product or product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur products and product candidates, and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and EMA (and/or by EEA member state authorities) and by comparable authorities in other countries, including ANVISA where we have received marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged two years and older in Brazil, Tegsedi for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis in Brazil and Waylivra for the treatment of FCS in Brazil. Failure to obtain, maintain or renew marketing authorization for any of our products or product candidates, as applicable, will prevent us from commercializing such product or product candidate.\nAs noted in the foregoing risk factors, we may not maintain the approvals we have received or receive further necessary approvals from the FDA, the EMA, ANVISA or other regulators to further commercialize any of our products or to commercialize any product candidate in any market. The approval procedures vary among countries, can involve additional testing, and the time for approval may materially differ. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may compromise our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. In addition, there is substantial risk that regulators in the applicable territories will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality\nof clinical data from our trials, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue, or may prevent us from generating any revenue, from the sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in those territories.\nSecuring marketing authorization requires the timely preparation and submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. In response to changes in the regulatory environment or requests from regulators, we may elect, or be obliged, to postpone a regulatory submission to include additional analyses, including those intended to strengthen our submission or facilitate regulator review, which could cause delays in getting our products to market and substantially increase our costs. Securing marketing authorization also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Changes to manufacturers, product candidate formulation, manufacturing processes and other product candidate attributes, such as the method of delivery, during product candidate development may also require additional studies to demonstrate the comparability of the product candidate using prior processes, formulation, or manufacturers, or with the prior attributes, to the product candidate using new the processes, formulation, or manufacturers, or with the new attributes.\nRegulatory authorities may determine that any of our products or product candidates are not effective or are only moderately effective, or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profiles or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing authorization or that prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining marketing authorizations is expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing authorization policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing authorization of a product candidate. Any marketing authorization we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. For example, the marketing authorization granted on a conditional basis by the EMA in the EEA for Translarna is limited to ambulatory nmDMD patients aged two years and older who have been identified through genetic testing and is subject to the specific obligation to conduct Study 041 and annual reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk analysis.\nIn addition, marketing authorizations in countries outside the United States do not ensure pricing approvals in those countries or in any other countries, and marketing authorizations and pricing approvals do not ensure that reimbursement will be obtained.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our products or product candidates in either the United States or the EU. If our competitors are able to obtain orphan drug designations for their products in the United States and those products are determined by the FDA to be the \u201csame drug\u201d as our products or product candidate(s) under applicable FDA standards, we may not be able to obtain approval for a significant period of time. Similarly, if our competitors are able to obtain orphan drug designations for their products in the EU and those products can be classified as a \u201csimilar medicinal product\u201d within the meaning of EU law, we may not be able to obtain approval by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the EU and the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. We have obtained orphan drug designations from the EMA and from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA, PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC, PTC-AS for the treatment of Angelman syndrome and PTC923 for the treatment of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia, including hyperphenylalaninemia caused by PKU. The FDA has also granted an orphan drug designation to PTC-FA for the treatment of Friedreich ataxia, emvododstat for the treatment of AML and unesbulin for the treatment of LMS and DIPG. We may also seek orphan drug exclusivity for other product candidates, if we believe that the product candidate may qualify. We, however, may not be able to obtain orphan drug designation in the future for any of our other product\ncandidates. Obtaining orphan drug exclusivity, both in the EU and in the United States, may be important to a product candidate\u2019s future success.\nIn the EU, if an orphan designated product subsequently receives the first marketing authorization for the indication for which it has received such a designation, the product is entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the EMA from accepting another marketing application for a similar medicinal product, even if the new marketing application relies on independently generated data submitted as part of a full marketing authorization application dossier. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six years, at the end of the fifth year, if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, including if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. In addition, a competing similar medicinal product may in limited circumstances be authorized prior to the expiration of the market exclusivity period, including if it is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan product. In this context, a \u201csimilar medicinal product\u201d is a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Product candidates can also lose orphan designation, and the related benefits, prior to obtaining a marketing authorization if it is demonstrated that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met.\nIn the United States, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing authorization for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the \u201csame drug\u201d for the same indication for that time period. When determining whether a drug is the \u201csame drug\u201d as an orphan designated product, the FDA looks to the products\u2019 molecular features and use. The specific sameness criteria, however, varies based on whether the product is composed of small or large molecules and if the product is a gene therapy. Moreover, for gene therapies, the sameness criteria is currently evolving. For example, the FDA recently issued a final guidance document specific to sameness determinations. Depending on product characteristics, sameness may be determined by the FDA on a case by case basis, making it difficult to predict when FDA may approve a product and whether periods of exclusivity will effectively block competitors seeking to market products that are the same or similar to ours for the same intended use. Accordingly, whether any of our products or product candidates will be deemed to be the same as another product or product candidate is uncertain.\nObtaining orphan drug designation, however, does not guarantee that we will be able to receive ultimate marketing approval. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a product candidate nor gives the product candidate any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. Moreover, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to multiple products that are considered to be the \u201csame drug\u201d for the same indication. If a competitor obtains an orphan drug designation for and approval of a product with orphan drug exclusivity for the same indication as one of our product candidates before we do and if the competitor\u2019s product is the same drug, in the United States or a similar medicinal product, in the EU, as ours, we could be excluded from the market for a period of time.\nWe also may not be able to maintain any orphan drug designations or exclusivities. For instance, orphan drug designations may be revoked if the FDA finds that the request for designation contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted material information, or if the FDA finds that the product candidate was not eligible for designation at the time of the submission of the request. Even if we are able to receive and maintain orphan drug designations, we may ultimately not receive any period of regulatory exclusivity if our product candidates are approved. For instance, we may not receive orphan product regulatory exclusivity if the indication for which we receive FDA approval is broader than the orphan drug designation. Orphan exclusivity may also be lost for the same reasons that designation may be lost. Orphan exclusivity may further be lost if we are unable to assure a sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nFurther, even if we do receive orphan drug exclusivity upon approval of a product candidate, this exclusivity is not absolute. For example, if a competitive product that is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as Translarna or another product candidate that has been granted orphan drug exclusivity is shown to be \u201cclinically superior\u201d to our product candidate as determined by the FDA or EMA, respectively, any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product. Orphan exclusivity also would not block FDA from approving a drug that is the same as our product candidates for different indications or products that are different from ours for the same indication.\nMoreover, marketing exclusivity would not prevent a provider from prescribing or using another drug off-label and third-party payors may reimburse for products off-label even if not indicated for the orphan condition.\nThe respective orphan designation and exclusivity frameworks in the United States and in the EU are subject to change, and any such changes may affect our ability to obtain, or the impact of obtaining, EU or United States orphan designations in the future.\nWe rely on non-patent market exclusivity periods under the Orphan Drug Act to commercialize Emflaza for the approved indication in the United States and we may rely on non-patent market exclusivity periods for other product candidates in the future. Failure to maintain exclusivity periods would have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize our products, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial statements and results of operations.\nAs we presently have no patent rights to protect the approved use of Emflaza, we rely on non-patent market exclusivity periods under the Orphan Drug Act to commercialize Emflaza in the United States.\nAs noted in the foregoing risk factor, generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing authorization for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of market exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. As previously discussed, however, the protection provided by orphan drug exclusivity is limited and orphan drug exclusivity may be withdrawn.\nEmflaza\u2019s seven-year period of orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older expires in February 2024 while its orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients two years of age to less than five expires in June 2026.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, during the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market any drug considered the \u201csame drug\u201d as the drug with the orphan drug exclusivity for the same rare disease or condition, except in limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product to the product with orphan drug exclusivity through a demonstration of superior safety, superior efficacy, or a major contribution to patient care. In addition, if a company seeks orphan drug designation for a drug considered the \u201csame drug\u201d as a drug previously approved for the orphan indication at issue, the FDA will not designate the \u201csame drug\u201d as an orphan drug unless the company articulates a plausible hypothesis of the clinical superiority of its drug to the approved drug, and, following such designation, if the previously approved drug has unexpired orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA will not approve the subsequent drug unless the sponsor demonstrates clinical superiority over the previously approved drug prior to approval. As a result, in the event that a competitive product that is the \u201csame drug\u201d as Emflaza is shown to be \u201cclinically superior\u201d to Emflaza as determined by the FDA, our orphan drug exclusivity will not block the approval of such competitive product. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.\nIn addition, we can lose any periods of granted orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, such as if the FDA finds that the request for designation contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted material information, or if the FDA finds that the product candidate was not eligible for designation at the time of the submission of the request. Orphan exclusivity may further be lost if we are unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of Emflaza to meet the needs of patients.\nFurther, the Orphan Drug Act is subject to change, and any such changes may affect our ability to maintain the respective market exclusivity period under those laws. Any reduction or limitation to the marketing exclusivity periods for Emflaza would materially limit our ability to commercialize the product, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial statements and results of operations.\nAll pharmaceutical products for which marketing authorization has been granted, including our products, are subject to extensive and rigorous governmental regulation and could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market. We may also be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved, as well as our product candidates during development.\nWe, our products and product candidates, our operations, our facilities, our suppliers and our contract manufacturers, distributors, contract research organizations, clinical trial sites and contract testing laboratories are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the EEA, the United States, and other territories, with regulations differing from country to country.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidates in the EEA, the United States, or other territories until we have received requisite regulatory approvals. In order to receive and maintain such approvals, and to be compliant with regulatory authority requirements, we and our third-party service providers must comply on a continuous basis with a broad array of regulations and requirements. Depending on the stage of product development and whether a product is approved these requirements may relate to establishment registration and product listing, the payment of user fees, manufacturing processes, risk management measures, quality and pharmacovigilance systems (including reporting of manufacturing deviations and adverse events), pre- and post-approval clinical and pre-clinical data, labeling, packaging, advertising, marketing and promotional activities (including product sampling), record keeping, distribution, storage, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Any regulatory approval of any of our products or product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn. For example, our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization, as well as the specific obligation to conduct and report the results of Study 041. After approving a drug, the FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. Requirements for additional clinical trials and studies to confirm safety and effectiveness may be imposed as a condition of marketing approval. In addition, the FDA requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products that have been commercialized, as well as REMS, and the agency has the power to require changes in labeling or to prevent further marketing and distribution of a product. For example, we were obligated to perform certain FDA post-marketing requirements in connection with our marketing authorization for Emflaza in the United States, including pre-clinical and clinical safety studies. Additionally, our marketing authorizations for Translarna, Tegsedi and Waylivra in Brazil and our marketing authorization for Translarna in Russia are subject to renewal every five years. There is no guarantee that we will be able to complete our post-marketing obligations in accordance with the established timetables. Failure to complete the required studies in accordance with the established timetables or failure to provide the requisite periodic reports on the status of post-marketing studies in the absence of good cause could result in an enforcement action. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing and distribution.\nFor additional information with respect to the risks related to renewal of our marketing authorization in the EEA, see the risk factor titled \u201cOur marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is a \u201cconditional marketing authorization\u201d that requires annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization and is further conditioned upon our ability to satisfy the specific obligation to conduct and report results from Study 041 by the end of the third quarter of 2022, and, as such, there is ongoing risk that we may be unable to maintain such authorization. If we are unable to obtain renewal of such marketing authorization in any future renewal cycle, we could lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna, whether pursuant to a commercial or an EAP program, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\u201d\nWe are required to submit safety and other post-market information and reports, implement pharmacovigilance plans, and comply with cGMP requirements related to manufacturing including, quality control, quality assurance and complaints and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to healthcare professionals and recordkeeping, among other things, in connection with the marketing authorizations described above and any future marketing authorizations we may receive. Application holders must further notify the FDA, and depending on the nature of the change, obtain FDA pre-approval for product and manufacturing changes.\nRegulatory authorities, including the EMA and local regulatory authorities in EEA member states, subject a marketed product, its manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities to ongoing review and periodic inspections and the EMA is responsible for coordinating inspections, undertaken by the competent authorities of applicable member states, of our manufacturing facilities to assess whether our manufacturing, and other procedures, comply with cGMP. Similar regulatory and inspection requirements apply in other jurisdictions including those imposed by the FDA in the United States. The FDA will typically inspect a manufacturer, including contract manufacturer organizations and clinical research sites, following acceptance of an NDA or BLA, which can delay FDA approval, especially if unsatisfactory inspection results are observed. Following approval, product sponsors and their contractors are subject to periodic unannounced FDA inspections to monitor and ensure compliance with FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. If an FDA inspection were to occur and compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers or research organizations were identified, it could also result in disruption of production or distribution of a product or product candidate, disruption, cancellation, or suspension of a study, or require substantial resources to correct.\nEven if marketing authorization of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed, the product may have labeling that includes significant restrictions, warnings, including black box warnings, and contraindications, the regulatory authorities may not approve label claims necessary for successful product marketing, or the approval may be subject to significant conditions of approval, including the requirement of a REMS. A regulatory authority also may impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. In addition, the competent authorities of each EU member state and the FDA closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and regulatory requirements. Such regulatory authorities can impose stringent restrictions on our communications regarding off-label use and if we do not comply with the laws governing promotion of approved drugs, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label promotion. For example, violations of the FDCA relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to civil and criminal penalties, investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, both before and after product approval, may yield various results which could negatively affect our business, including:\n\u25cf restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf changes to or restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u25cf modifications to promotional pieces;\n\u25cf issuance of corrective information;\n\u25cf clinical holds or termination of clinical trials;\n\u25cf changes in the way a product is administered;\n\u25cf liability for harm caused to patients or subjects;\n\u25cf adverse publicity, reputational harm, or the product becoming less competitive;\n\u25cf regulatory authority issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;\n\u25cf restrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u25cf requirements to implement a REMS;\n\u25cf requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf warning, cyber or untitled letters;\n\u25cf withdrawal of the products from the market or marketing suspensions;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u25cf recall of products;\n\u25cf fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorizations;\n\u25cf refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u25cf product seizure or detention;\n\u25cf injunctions;\n\u25cf the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; or\n\u25cf FDA debarment, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, consent decrees, or corporate integrity agreements.\nNon-compliance with regulatory requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nNot only will we be responsible for our own conduct, but we will also be responsible for the conduct of our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, manufacturers, investigators, and contract research organizations. To the extent that any of these third parties engage in intentional, reckless, negligent, or unintentional failures to comply applicable legal and regulatory requirements, we may be subject to regulatory enforcement action, legal actions and liability, and serious harm to our reputation. Moreover, it is possible for a whistleblower to pursue a False Claims Act case against us as a result of such third party conduct, even if the government considers the claim unmeritorious and declines to intervene, which could require us to incur costs defending against such a claim.\nAny of the above events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of developing and commercializing such product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale. Any of these events could further have other material and adverse effects on our operations and business and could adversely impact our stock price and could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe are also subject to laws and license and registration requirements covering the distribution of marketed products. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, we may be subject to action by regulatory agencies, which could negatively affect our business. Regulatory agencies may also change existing requirements or adopt new requirements or policies. We may be slow to adapt or may not be able to adapt to these changes or new requirements. Any new requirements could further prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of product candidates, could limit marketability of approved products, or could impose additional burdensome and costly regulatory obligations.\nCommercialization of Translarna has been in, and is expected to continue to take place in, countries that tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues. Failure to obtain and maintain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and other countries where Translarna is available would delay or prevent us from marketing our product in such regions, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn some countries, particularly the member states of the EEA, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. Each country in the EEA has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations and may have other regulations related to the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products in the country. We generally will not be able to commence commercial sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD pursuant to the marketing authorization granted by the European Commission in any particular member state of the EEA until we conclude the applicable pricing and reimbursement negotiations and comply with any licensing, employment or related regulatory requirements in that country. In some countries we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies of our product, including trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. We may not be able to conclude pricing and reimbursement negotiations or comply with additional regulatory requirements in the countries in which we seek to commercialize Translarna on a timely basis, or at all.\nThe pricing and reimbursement process varies from country to country and can take a substantial amount of time from initiation to completion. Pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. We cannot predict the timing of Translarna\u2019s commercial launch in countries where we are awaiting pricing and reimbursement guidelines. While we have submitted pricing and reimbursement dossiers with respect to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in many EEA countries, we have only received both pricing and reimbursement approval on terms that are acceptable to us in a limited number of countries.\nThe price that is approved by governmental authorities in any country pursuant to commercial pricing and reimbursement processes may be significantly lower than the price we are able to charge for sales under our reimbursed EAP programs and various forms of national \u201cmarket access agreements\u201d may need to be entered into to achieve reimbursement. In some instances, reimbursement may be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payors.\nFor example, in France, EAP and commercial sales of a product can begin while pricing and reimbursement rates are under discussion with the applicable government health programs. In the event that the negotiated price of the product is lower than the amount reimbursed for sales made prior to the conclusion of price negotiations, we may become obligated to repay such excess amount to the applicable government health program. We will make such retroactive reimbursement, if any, following the conclusion of price negotiations with the applicable government health authority.\nFurther, based on unsustainable economics imposed by the arbitration board in Germany upon the conclusion of an arbitration process in 2016 with us and the German Federal Association of the Statutory Health Insurances, we delisted Translarna from the German pharmacy ordering system, effective April 1, 2016. While some patients and healthcare professionals in Germany have been able to access Translarna through a reimbursed importation pathway possible under German law, there can be no assurance that other patients or healthcare professionals in Germany will be successful doing so or, if initially successful, that any or all will continue to be successful. We were required to reimburse payors in Germany the difference between the commercial price of Translarna and the price established by the arbitration board in Germany for sales made in Germany after December 2015, other than sales made pursuant to the reimbursed importation pathway.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing and reimbursement negotiations and there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. For example, these factors influenced the length of our pricing and reimbursement negotiations in England, which took place between mid-2014 to mid-2016, and culminated in a temporary managed access agreement between us, National Health Services England, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, NorthStar clinical network and the patient organizations Muscular Dystrophy UK and Action Duchenne. The managed access agreement establishes the clinical details surrounding the use of Translarna, including the terms and conditions of a confidential financial arrangement and the collection of further data on the efficacy of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD with NICE guidance, before future funding decisions are taken.\nIn addition, adverse clinical and regulatory developments may exacerbate these risks, including the developments noted in the foregoing risk factor titled, \u201cACT DMD did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, and there is substantial risk that regulators will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\u201d\nReference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices and revenues. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.\nIf we fail to successfully secure and maintain pricing and reimbursement coverage for Translarna or are significantly delayed in doing so or if burdensome conditions are imposed by private payers, government authorities or other third-party payors on such reimbursement, planned launches in the affected countries will be delayed and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur relationships with customers, healthcare providers and professionals, patients, patient organizations, and third-party payors are or will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products or product candidates, including Translarna and Emflaza, for which we have obtained or may obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with customers, healthcare providers and professionals and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the\nbusiness or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing authorization.\nFailure to maintain a comprehensive and effective compliance program, and to integrate the operations of any acquired businesses into a combined comprehensive and effective compliance program on a timely basis, could subject us to a range of regulatory actions that could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and could harm or prevent sales of the affected products, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products.\nRestrictions and reporting requirements under applicable U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, and equivalent laws and regulations in the EU and other countries in which we operate, include, and are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or Bribery Act, and similar statutes which have been adopted, or may be adopted in the future, by other countries in which we operate and with which we are or may be required to comply.\n\u25cf Anti-kickback laws and regulations, including those applicable in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries where we operate, which generally prohibit, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under government funded healthcare programs. The U.S. federal statute imposes criminal penalties and has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others and many states have enacted equivalent state laws that apply not only to government payors but to commercial payors as well.\n\u25cf False claim laws and regulations, including the U.S. False Claims Act and similar state laws, which may permit civil whistleblower or qui tam actions and may impose civil liability and criminal penalties on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. Federal enforcement agencies have shown increased interest under the federal Anti-Kickback Stature and the federal civil False Claims Act in pharmaceutical companies\u2019 product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services and donations to independent charitable patient assistance programs. A number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements.\n\u25cf Federal price reporting laws, including the Medicaid drug rebate statute, which requires manufacturers of covered outpatient drugs to calculate and submit complex pricing information that is used as the basis for reimbursement of certain drugs by, and payment of rebates to, the Medicaid program; the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or Medicare Modernization Act, which requires manufacturers to calculate and report a drug\u2019s Average Sales Price used to reimburse providers for physician-administered drugs under Medicare Part B; and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, which requires, manufacturers of covered drugs (including all drugs approved under an NDA) to calculate and report a Federal Ceiling Price and offer their covered drugs for sale at no more than that price to the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and other agencies. The Veterans Health Care Act also requires manufacturers to enter into pricing agreements with the Department of Health and Human Services to charge no more than a different ceiling price (derived from the Medicaid rebate percentage) to covered entities participating in the 340B drug discount program. Failure to accurately report drug pricing or provide the mandatory discounts may subject the manufacturer to specific civil monetary penalties. Failure to comply with the Veterans Health Care Act also jeopardizes payment by Medicaid for the manufacturer\u2019s drugs. Certain states have also enacted drug price transparency laws that require reporting of pricing information, including certain increases in a drug\u2019s wholesale acquisition cost and the reasons causing the price increase.\n\u25cf Laws and regulations related to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, including HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and similar state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and their implementing regulations, impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information, and may impose criminal and civil liability for violations of those obligations. In addition, international data protection laws including the European General Data Protection Regulation, and supplementary member state, United Kingdom, European Economic Area, and\nSwiss legislation may apply to some or all of the clinical or other protected data obtained, transmitted, or stored from those territories. These laws require specific, freely given and fully informed consent to be obtained from patients or clinical study participants. There are also other requirements for lawful processing, including transparency obligations, data minimization requirements, data transfer and compliance obligations with individuals\u2019 stringent rights to access their personal data and to otherwise control the processing of their personal data. There are data breach notification obligations, to supervisory authorities and to individuals, where there are potential risks to them arising from the data breach. These laws impose high regulatory fines in the event of breach of processing requirements of up to 4% of global annual turnover or EUR 20 million (whichever is the higher amount). Further certain privacy laws and genetic testing laws may apply directly to our operations and/or those of our collaborators and may impose restrictions on our use and dissemination of individuals\u2019 health information.\n\u25cf HIPAA also imposes liability, including criminal liability, for, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, in connection with the delivery or payment for healthcare benefits, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. Notably, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent requirement of certain of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation.\n\u25cf Laws and regulations governing the advertising and promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and patients, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. For example, legislation adopted by individual EU member states that may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product\u2019s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. Promotion of indications not covered by the SmPC is specifically prohibited.\n\u25cf Laws and regulations regulating off-label promotion of medicinal products, which is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at EU level and in the individual EU member states also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.\n\u25cf Laws and regulations in the United States, including the FDCA and other laws and regulations, that prohibit us from promoting any of our FDA approved products for off-label uses and that require compliance with FDA\u2019s advertising and promotional requirements. For example, the FDA requires that all product advertising and promotion be consistent with the FDA approved label, be truthful and non-misleading, be adequately substantiated, and have fair balance between product benefit claims and risks, among other requirements. This means, for example, that we cannot make claims about the use of our marketed products or their relative benefits compared to other treatments outside of their FDA approved indications and label and without adequate comparative studies, and we would not be able to discuss or provide information on off-label uses or safety benefits of such products in a promotional context. While physicians may choose to prescribe products for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, we are prohibited from marketing and promoting the products for indications and uses that are not specifically approved by the FDA. Should the FDA or other regulatory authorities determine that our activities constituted the promotion of off-label use or a violation of its other promotional and marketing standards, we could face significant enforcement action and substantial penalties, including, but not limited to action to prevent us from distributing those products for the off-label use and could impose fines and penalties on us and our executives, and such a determination could also trigger civil or criminal liability under other applicable laws in the United States.\n\u25cf Laws and regulations requiring that we disclose publicly payments made to certain healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, including in certain EU member states and the United States. For example, in the United\nStates, under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requirements, manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies must report information related to certain payments and other transfers of value made to or at the request of covered recipients, such as physicians, certain other healthcare professionals, and teaching hospitals, as well as physician and immediate family ownership and investment interests in such manufacturers. A number of U.S. states and other countries have enacted their own transparency requirements that obligate manufacturers to report different types of spending related to physicians, certain hospitals and other healthcare organizations, and other covered recipients.\nIn addition, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians\u2019 codes of professional conduct. In the United States, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with these industry and physician codes and the relevant compliance guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers promulgated by the federal government. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national laws of the EU member states, as well as codes of conduct issued by self-regulatory industry bodies. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, their competent professional organization, and the competent authorities of the individual EU member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU member states.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws, regulations, transparency requirements and self-regulatory codes have and will continue to involve substantial costs. We cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants, our third-party contractors, or the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, are or will be in compliance with all federal, state and ex-U.S. regulations and codes. It is possible that governmental authorities could conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Exclusion, suspension and debarment from government funded healthcare, procurement and non-procurement programs would adversely affect, perhaps materially, our ability to commercialize, sell or distribute any drug. Even if we were not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant time and resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory changes affecting the pharmaceutical industry or the healthcare system more broadly may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain or maintain marketing authorization of and commercialize our products and product candidates and affect the coverage and reimbursement we may obtain.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations, or financial results. In the United States and some ex-U.S. jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing authorization of Translarna or any of our other product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any products or product candidates, including Translarna and Emflaza, for which we have obtained, or may obtain, marketing authorization.\nCertain provisions of enacted or proposed legislative changes may negatively impact coverage and reimbursement of healthcare items and services. For example, in the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that we receive for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own policies. Therefore, any restrictions to coverage or reductions in reimbursement that result from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar coverage restriction or\nreimbursement reduction from private payors. In addition, private payors may implement coverage restrictions or payment reductions independently from federal programs such as Medicare.\nSimilarly, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products. However, legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act may contribute to the uncertainty of the ongoing implementation and impact of the Affordable Care Act and also underscore the potential for additional reform going forward. The Biden administration is expected to continue to take measures to further facilitate the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We cannot assure that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results.\nPromulgated and proposed regulatory changes could also affect coverage or reimbursement of our products and in 2016, CMS issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program, which among other things, revises the manner in which the \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the ACA. More recently, Congress amended the Medicaid statute, effective October 1, 2019, to exclude prices paid by secondary manufacturers for an authorized generic drug (but not a product approved under the BLA process) from the NDA holder\u2019s AMP for the brand, thereby increasing the rebate amount and the 340B price for the brand. This was implemented by CMS in a final rule issued December 31, 2020. The rule also expanded the definition of products identified as \u201cline extensions\u201d and, in certain circumstances, required inclusion of patient copay assistance in Medicaid best price (effective January 1, 2023), thereby potentially increasing Medicaid rebates paid by manufacturers for such drugs. 340B program guidance regulations on civil monetary penalties for statutory violations, which had been finalized in early 2017 but deferred, recently also went into effect. On November 27, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing a Most Favored Nation payment model under which reimbursement for certain Medicare Part B drugs and biologicals will be based on a price that reflects the lowest per capita Gross Domestic Product-adjusted (GDP-adjusted) price of any non-U.S. member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a GDP per capita that is at least sixty percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. This rule now has been rescinded, but similar programs have been included in current proposed legislation.\nWe anticipate that the U.S. Congress, administrative agencies, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include:\n\u25cf controls on government funded reimbursement for drugs;\n\u25cf caps or mandatory discounts under certain government sponsored programs;\n\u25cf controls on healthcare providers;\n\u25cf challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits on reimbursement of specific products through other means;\n\u25cf reform of drug importation laws and policies;\n\u25cf expansion of use of managed care systems in which the healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person; and\n\u25cf requirements or restrictions related to direct-to-consumer advertising or drug marketing practices.\nWe are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. In particular, we are unable to predict what changes the Biden administration will implement through the U.S. Congress or future executive orders and how these would impact us. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted, could significantly decrease the available coverage and the price we might establish for our products, which would have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results. Changes in FDA laws, regulations, and policies may also make it more difficult to obtain and maintain marketing authorizations.\nIn the EU, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize Translarna and our product candidates. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the EU or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs. We cannot predict how future changes relating to healthcare reform in the EU, the United States, or other territories, will affect our business.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have also been made to expand post-approval requirements, limit regulatory exclusivity periods or the applicability of such exclusivity periods, restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products and to otherwise encourage competition in the market and bring down drug prices, including proposals related to drug importation. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted in any territory in which we are authorized, or become authorized, to market Translarna, Emflaza, or any of our other product candidates, or whether applicable regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing authorizations of our products or product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process or by comparable ex-U.S. bodies overseeing regulatory authorities in other territories may significantly delay or prevent marketing authorization, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. We cannot predict how future changes relating to pre- and post-marketing approval and requirements will affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may expend our resources to pursue a particular product, product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe focus on products, research programs and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential.\nFor example, in connection with our acquisition of Agilis, we paid upfront consideration comprised of $49.2 million in cash and 3,500,907 shares of our common stock. Agilis equityholders may become entitled to receive contingent payments from us based on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and net sales milestones as well as based upon a percentage of net sales of certain products. Additionally, we entered into a Rights Exchange Agreement, pursuant to which we issued 2,821,176 shares of our common stock and paid $36.9 million, in the aggregate, to the Participating Rightholders in exchange for the cancellation and forfeiture by the Participating Rightholders of their rights to receive certain milestone-based contingent payments under the Agilis Merger Agreement. We may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Agilis and by investing our resources in this product, we may be required to forgo or delay other opportunities.\nIn addition, we have previously commenced clinical trials that were not successful for a number of reasons, including inconsistent or negative data and difficulties identifying qualified patients. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.\nNotwithstanding our large investments to date and anticipated future expenditures in proprietary technologies for both small-molecule and gene therapy drug discovery, to date we have been granted marketing authorization for a limited number of commercial products and have not achieved profitability. We may never realize a return on investment. We may not be able to successfully renew or satisfy the ongoing requirements of our current marketing authorizations for our current products and we may never successfully develop any other marketable drugs or indications using our scientific approach. As a result of pursuing the development of product candidates using our proprietary technologies, we may fail to develop product candidates or address indications based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture and distribution of our products and certain of our product candidates, which may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates, such quantities may not meet the applicable regulatory quality standards, or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization or development efforts. For certain of our product candidates, we may also directly engage in manufacturing, which will require significant expenditures and compliance with FDA\u2019s manufacturing requirements.\nWe have limited personnel with experience in drug manufacturing and currently rely on third parties to manufacture our products and certain product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We currently rely on third parties for supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients used in all of our products and product candidates. We outsource most of the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and distribution of our products and certain of our product candidates to third parties, including our commercial supply of Translarna and Emflaza. In 2021, we began cGMP manufacturing of clinical material at the Hopewell Facility for certain of our gene therapy product candidates other than PTC-AADC. We still rely on third-party manufacturers to complete product testing for all of our gene therapy product candidates that we manufacture at the Hopewell Facility as well as to provide sufficient quantities of certain program materials that we have not yet transitioned to Hopewell. With respect to the Hopewell Facility, we are required to directly comply with the applicable regulatory authorities\u2019 manufacturing requirements and are subject to inspection in the same way that our contract manufacturers are. Utilizing our own manufacturing will require a significant continued investment and we may not be successful in maintaining our own manufacturing capacity, especially given the complexities of gene therapy manufacturing. For additional information, see the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to Our Gene Therapy Platform\u201d titled, \u201cWe have limited experience manufacturing gene therapy products or product candidates on our own and could encounter problems and delays in operating our biologics manufacturing facility that could adversely affect our business.\u201d\nWe do not directly control manufacturing for most of our products and product candidates and we are dependent on and will continue to be dependent on, our contract manufacturers for compliance with cGMP or good distribution practice, or GDP, or similar regulatory requirements outside the EU and the United States for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. Should we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with these requirements, we and they could face significant regulatory and commercial consequences. For example, the FDA regularly inspects manufacturing and other drug/biologic facilities. Our manufacturers and manufacturing facilities must also be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our marketing applications to the agency and will be subject to continuing FDA and other regulatory authority inspections should we receive marketing approval. If we or our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the EU member state regulatory authorities, FDA, or other ex-U.S. regulatory agencies, we or they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for the manufacturing facilities, and we would not be able to secure and/or maintain, or may be delayed in securing regulatory approval of marketing applications or supplements for the applicable products or product candidates. In addition, we or third-party manufacturers or distributors may not be able to comply with cGMP or good distribution practice, or GDP, or similar regulatory requirements outside the EU and the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers or distributors, over whom we have no direct control, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds or termination of clinical studies, warning or untitled letters, regulatory communications warning the public about safety issues with a product, import or export refusals, license revocation, seizures, detentions, or recalls of product candidates or product, operating restrictions, criminal prosecutions or debarment, suits under the civil False Claims act, corporate integrity agreements, or consent decrees any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products or product candidates and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we have no direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Furthermore, all of our contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which exposes our manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such other materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may generally affect the regulatory status of our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities. If the FDA, EU member state regulatory authorities or a comparable ex-U.S. regulatory agency do not approve these or our facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws its approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would negatively impact our ability to develop,\nobtain regulatory approval for or market our products or product candidates, if approved. There is also no guarantee that we would be able to find alternative manufacturing facilities or enter into agreements with alternative manufacturers on favorable terms. There may be limited manufacturers who would have the ability to manufacture our products and product candidates, especially our gene therapy product candidates. To the extent that we decide to manufacture our own clinical and commercial supply for our PTC-AADC program as an alternative source of supply, there is no guarantee that we will be able to cost-effectively produce sufficient quantities of our program materials. Moreover, any alternative manufacturers would need to be approved by FDA, which approval is not guaranteed. We, accordingly, may not be able to make alternative manufacturing arrangements, which could adversely affect our products, product candidates, and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently rely on a single source for the production of some of our raw materials and we obtain our supply of the drug substance for Translarna from two third-party manufacturers. We engage two separate manufacturers to provide bulk drug product for Translarna. We have a relationship with three manufacturers that are capable of providing fill and finish services for our finished commercial and clinical Translarna product.\nWe do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of Translarna or any of our product candidates, although we may seek to establish such arrangements in the future. In the event that we are unable to procure supply from a validated manufacturer, we would seek to identify and qualify replacement suppliers, however this process would likely delay our ability to supply Translarna to patients or advance our clinical trials. We may be unable to conclude agreements for commercial or clinical supply of Translarna with third-party manufacturers, or we may be unable to do so on acceptable terms.\nWe currently have contracts with multiple pharmacy and hospital distributors in the EU that distribute Translarna for limited commercial and EAP programs. We have engaged with third-party logistic providers, or 3PLs, which distribute Translarna for the majority of our commercial and EAP programs on our behalf.\nWe obtain our supply of the drug substance for Emflaza through a third-party manufacturer that is currently the only third-party manufacturer qualified to provide Emflaza drug substance for use in the United States. All of our drug product manufacturing, processing and packaging needs for Emflaza tablet and suspension product are fulfilled through two different exclusive supply agreements that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Emflaza. We expect to fulfill all of our requirements for Emflaza tablets as well as secondary packaging of pre-filled Emflaza oral suspension bottles pursuant to one of these agreements, which has an automatic renewal provision subject to the termination rights of each party. We expect to fulfill all of our requirements for Emflaza suspension product pursuant to the other agreement. Through the seventh year anniversary of FDA approval of Emflaza, we are obligated to pay to the manufacturer of the Emflaza suspension product royalty payments, on a quarterly basis, based on a percentage (ranging from low to middle-low double digits) of, or a fixed payment with respect to, our annual net sales of suspension product in the United States, subject to reduction in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The royalty payments for the suspension product are subject to a minimum aggregate annual payment ranging from \u20ac0.5 million to \u20ac1.5 million per year.\nIf our drug substance provider or either of our drug product manufacturers becomes unable to provide drug substance or manufacture Emflaza product in sufficient quantities to meet projected demand, future sales could be adversely affected, which in turn could have a detrimental impact on our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the United States and on our ability to commercialize Emflaza, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and results of operations. Further, as we presently have no patent rights to protect the approved use of Emflaza, we rely upon market exclusivity periods available to us under the Orphan Drug Act to commercialize Emflaza for DMD in the United States. As the holder of orphan exclusivity, we are required to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of Emflaza to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in loss of the drug\u2019s orphan exclusivity in the United States, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from sales of Emflaza.\nWe utilize third parties for the commercial distribution of Emflaza, including a 3PL to warehouse Emflaza as well as specialty pharmacies to sell and distribute Emflaza to patients. The specialty pharmacies provide us with third-party call center services to provide patient support and financial services, prescription intake and distribution, reimbursement adjudication, and ongoing compliance support. If we are unable to effectively manage this distribution process, the continuance of our commercial launch and sales of Emflaza may be delayed or compromised.\nPursuant to the Tegsedi-Waylivra Agreement, we have entered into a master supply agreement with Akcea whereby Akcea or its affiliates will manufacture and supply, or cause to be manufactured and supplied, Tegsedi and Waylivra in quantities sufficient to support the commercialization of Tegsedi and Waylivra in the PTC Territory. This is currently the only manufacturing and supply agreement that we have entered into for the drug substance of Tegsedi and Waylivra. If the master supply agreement is terminated and we are unable to find an alternative third party contractor, we may encounter delays in manufacturing Tegsedi and Waylivra.\nWe have a commercial manufacturing services agreement with MassBio to provide sufficient quantities of our PTC-AADC program materials to meet anticipated clinical trial and commercial scale demands. This is currently the only manufacturing services agreement that we have entered into for PTC-AADC. If the commercial manufacturing services agreement is terminated and we are unable to find an alternative third party contractor, we may encounter delays in manufacturing PTC-AADC.\nEven if we are able to establish and maintain arrangements with third-party manufacturers and distributors, reliance on such service providers as well as the use of specialty pharmacies and a call center entails additional risks, including:\n\u25cf reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u25cf the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u25cf the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u25cf the possibility of commercial supplies of our products not being distributed to commercial vendors or end users in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales;\n\u25cf the possibility of clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions;\n\u25cf the possibility of third-party resources not being devoted in the manner necessary to satisfy our requirements within the expected time frame;\n\u25cf the possibility of third parties not providing us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using our products, or serious adverse events and/or product complaints regarding our products;\n\u25cf the possibility of third parties being unable to satisfy their financial obligations to us or to others; and\n\u25cf the possible termination or nonrenewal of a critical agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us.\nMany additional factors could cause production or distribution interruptions with the manufacture and distribution of any of our products and product candidates, including human error, natural disasters, labor disputes, acts of terrorism or war, equipment malfunctions, contamination, supply chain disruption, including disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or raw material shortages. We have experienced delays in receiving certain raw materials in connection with supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, however, these delays did not affect or delay our manufacturing given our existing inventories for such materials. If the supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic creates more prolonged delays, the supplies of our products or products candidates may be significantly and adversely affected and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur products and product candidates and any other products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. In addition, changes in cGMP regulations could negatively impact our ability or the ability of our contract manufacturers to complete the manufacturing process of our products and our product candidates in a compliant manner on the schedule we require for commercial and clinical trial use, respectively.\nIf we or the third parties that we engage to manufacture product for our commercial sales, preclinical tests and clinical trials should, prior to the time that we have validated alternative providers, cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience delays in our ability to supply Translarna, Emflaza, Tegsedi or Waylivra to patients or in our ability to advance our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our\nproducts or product candidates or the drug substances used to manufacture them, we will lose commercial sales revenue and it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively.\nWe or our contract manufacturers may also encounter other impediments or difficulties that could adversely affect our products, product candidates, and our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, we or our manufacturers may experience shortages in raw materials and components, not be able to scale up manufacturing capacities to support more advanced clinical trials or product commercialization, may not be able to qualify or validate facilities, equipment, and processes, or may not be able to obtain or develop the necessary technological capabilities, either through knowledge transfer or independent development. To the extent that any contract manufacturers develop proprietary manufacturing processes or procedures, should we need to change manufacturers, we may not be able to transfer such know-how to a new manufacturer. In such a case, the new manufacturer would need to invest substantial time, money, and effort to develop its own processes and procedures, which would require FDA approval.\nThird parties might illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or unfit versions of our products that do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit or unfit drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or unfit drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture and distribution of Translarna, Emflaza, Tegsedi, Waylivra and certain of our product candidates may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and limit our ability to grow including our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize our products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe do not independently conduct preclinical or clinical trials for our products or product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to perform this function. While we have agreements governing the activities of such third parties, we have limited influence and control over their actual performance and activities. For instance, our third-party service providers are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, non-clinical, and preclinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our trials may be repeated, extended, delayed, or terminated, we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates, or we or they may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. To the extent we are unable to successfully identify and manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Further, any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it would delay our product development activities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as GCP for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, we will be required to report certain financial\ninterests of our third-party investigators if these relationships exceed certain financial thresholds or meet other criteria. The FDA or comparable ex-U.S. regulatory authorities may question the integrity of the data from those clinical trials conducted by investigators who may have conflicts of interest. We must further ensure that our preclinical trials are conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices, or GLPs, as appropriate. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical and preclinical investigators, and trial sites. Similar GCP and transparency requirements apply in the EU. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, including with respect to clinical trials conducted outside the EU and United States, can also lead regulatory authorities to refuse to accept into account clinical trial data submitted as part of a marketing application, as well as other regulatory consequences, as further described above.\nFor example, in the first half of 2013 inspectors acting at the request of the EMA conducted GCP inspections of selected clinical sites from our completed Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and our clinical trial site relating to our then pending marketing authorization application for approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Following these inspections, we received inspection reports containing a combination of critical and major findings. These findings related to waivers we granted to admit patients to our Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in advance of formal approval of protocol amendments that would have established their eligibility for the trial, as well as our oversight of our trial sites and the completeness or sufficiency of clinical trial documentation. In response to these findings, we described to the EMA the enhanced internal procedures and controls we have implemented, and the internal quality assurance department we have established, since the conclusion of our Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In addition, we proposed corrective action plans to address the inspectors\u2019 specific findings. If we do not meet our commitment to the corrective actions we proposed to the EMA, we may face additional consequences, including rejection of data or other direct action by national regulatory authorities, which could require us to conduct additional clinical trials or other supportive studies to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or to obtain full approval from the EMA.\nFurthermore, third parties that we rely on for our clinical development activities may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing authorizations for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or obtaining marketing authorizations.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing authorizations of our products or product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, on collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of some of our products and product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these products and product candidates.\nFor each of our product candidates, we plan to evaluate the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves or entering into selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, such as our collaborations with Roche and the SMA Foundation, for our spinal muscular atrophy program, including Evrysdi. We have entered into arrangements with certain third parties to market or distribute Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in certain countries and, as we continue to implement our commercialization plans for Translarna, we anticipate that we will engage additional third parties to perform these functions for us in other countries. We generally plan to seek collaborators for the development and commercialization of product candidates that have high anticipated development costs, are directed at indications for which a potential collaborator has a particular expertise, or involve markets that require a large sales and marketing organization to serve effectively. Our likely collaborators for any marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements may include: large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and/or biotechnology companies.\nWe will have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates and our collaborators will be subject to the same product development and commercialization risks that we are subject to. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 desire and ability to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. In particular, the commercial success of Evrysdi will depend on the success of Roche\u2019s commercialization program. Furthermore, the successful development of another product candidate from our spinal muscular atrophy program will depend on the success of our collaborations with the SMA Foundation and Roche, including whether Roche pursues clinical development of any other compounds identified under the collaborations.\nCollaborations involving our products and product candidates, including our collaborations with the SMA Foundation and Roche, pose the following risks to us:\n\u25cf collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u25cf collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our products and product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs, based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that replace or compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u25cf collaborators may fail to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, subjecting them or us to potential regulatory enforcement action;\n\u25cf a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u25cf collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u25cf collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u25cf disputes may arise between the collaborator and us as to the ownership of intellectual property arising during the collaboration;\n\u25cf we may grant exclusive rights for our products or product candidates to our collaborators, which would prevent us from collaborating with others, or from using our products or product candidates ourselves;\n\u25cf disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the collaboration, which may include ending research, development or commercialization activities for our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u25cf collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nWe may rely on third parties to perform many essential services for any products that we commercialize, including services related to warehousing and inventory control, distribution, government price reporting, customer service, accounts receivable management, cash collection, and pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting. If these third parties fail to perform as expected or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, our ability to commercialize our product candidates will be significantly impacted and we may be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nWe may retain third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the sale and distribution of our product candidates, key aspects of which will be out of our direct control. These service providers may provide key services related to warehousing and inventory control, distribution, customer service, accounts receivable management, and cash collection. If we retain a service provider, we would substantially rely on it as well as other third-party providers that perform services for us, including entrusting our inventories of products to their care and handling. If these third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, or encounter physical or natural damage at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired and we may be subject to regulatory enforcement action.\nIn addition, we may engage third parties to perform various other services for us relating to pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting, safety database management, fulfillment of requests for medical information regarding our product candidates and related services. If the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these service providers is insufficient, or these third parties otherwise fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nAdditionally, we may contract with a third party to calculate and report pricing information mandated by various government programs. If a third party fails to timely report or adjust prices as required, or errors in calculating government pricing information from transactional data in our financial records, it could impact our discount and rebate liability, and potentially subject us to regulatory sanctions or False Claims Act lawsuits.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in our, or our collaborators\u2019 or third-party vendors\u2019, cyber-security.\nWe collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including personal information, operational and financial transactions and records, clinical trial data and information relating to intellectual property, on internal information systems and through the information systems of collaborators and third-party vendors with whom we contract. Despite our implementation of security measures, including implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework, instituting a training and compliance program on cybersecurity for all employees and doing a yearly external audit and penetration test, these information systems are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet or other mechanisms, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. No such security measures can eliminate the possibility of the information systems\u2019 improper functioning or the improper access or disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, criminals, ex-U.S. governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, collaborators, or other third-party vendors to disclose sensitive information or take other actions, including making fraudulent payments or downloading malware, by using \u201cspoofing\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails or other types of attacks. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy, despite our having a security risk insurance policy and disaster recovery and incident response plans. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims and liability, damage to our reputation, suffer loss or harm to our intellectual property rights, face significant financial exposure, including incurring significant costs to remediate possible injury to the affected parties and the further research, development and commercial efforts of our products and product candidates could be delayed.\nProduct liability and other civil lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit clinical trials or commercialization of any current or future products.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the commercialization of our products and any product candidate that we may market or commercialize, any gene therapy product materials that we manufacture for third parties at the Hopewell Facility and in connection with the human clinical trials testing of our products and product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates, products or gene therapy product materials caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy;\n\u25cf decreased demand for our products or any product candidates that we may develop;\n\u25cf decreased demand for the gene therapy product materials that we manufacture for third parties at the Hopewell Facility;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf the inability to continue current clinical trials or begin planned clinical trials;\n\u25cf withdrawal or reduced enrollment of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf significant costs to defend the related claims/litigation;\n\u25cf increased insurance costs, or an inability to maintain appropriate insurance coverage;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants, patients and/or their families;\n\u25cf loss of revenue;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize or to continue commercializing any products or product candidates;\n\u25cf initiation of investigations and enforcement actions by regulators; and\n\u25cf the withdrawal of products from the market, product recalls, or the cessation of development or regulatory disapproval of product candidates or withdrawal of approvals, as well as labeling, marketing, or promotional restrictions.\nBecause emvododstat for COVID-19 is being developed under an emergency Declaration, we may be eligible for limited liability protection under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP Act. The PREP Act provides limited immunity for manufacturers from claims for losses arising out of the administration or use of a \u201ccovered countermeasure.\u201d However, the PREP Act does not provide complete immunity as injured persons may still bring a suit for \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d under some circumstances. The PREP Act also does not provide immunity against federal enforcement actions or claims under federal law for equitable relief. \u201cCovered countermeasures\u201d include \u201cqualified pandemic or epidemic products\u201d, such as those for COVID-19. For these immunities to apply, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, must issue a declaration of a public health emergency, as was done for COVID-19. To be covered by PREP Act immunity, activities and products must further meet the criteria set forth in the HHS declaration of immunity from liability, and the therapeutic must be authorized by the FDA, or authorized for investigational or emergency use for the applicable emergency. The federal government has continuously revised its PREP Act declaration and has provided multiple advisory opinions regarding its interpretation of the PREP Act declarations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, interpretation of the scope of the PREP Act may change. Additionally, the PREP Act may not provide adequate coverage or immunity for all potential claims related to our COVID-19 product candidate.\nWe have product liability insurance that covers our commercial sales, sales pursuant to reimbursed EAP programs and clinical trials up to a $25.0 million annual aggregate limit, and subject to a per claim deductible. Our insurance limits may not be adequate to cover all liabilities and defense costs that we may incur. We may need to further increase our insurance coverage as we commercialize our products, or as and when we begin commercializing any other product candidate that receives marketing authorization. The cost of insurance coverage is highly variable, based on a wide range of factors. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability or defense costs that may arise.\nIn addition, we could be subject to other costly civil litigation, including contractual claims with respect to our expected manufacturing of gene therapy product materials for potential external customers. If our customers believe that we have\nviolated our contractual terms, they may seek reimbursement for the cost of our gene therapy product materials or other related losses, the cost of which could be significant.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, manufacturing and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations currently, and may in the future, involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and medical and biological materials, and produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials or disposal of hazardous wastes, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We also maintain liability insurance for some of these risks, but our liability policy excludes pollution and has an aggregate coverage limit of $11.0 million.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or manufacturing and distribution efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Dr. Stuart W. Peltz, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, and the other principal members of our executive, commercial and scientific teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our executive officers. The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. Additionally, because the field of gene therapies and gene therapy manufacturing is new and complex, we might face a shortage of skilled individuals with substantial gene therapy and gene therapy manufacturing experience. As a result, competition for skilled personnel, including in gene therapy research and gene therapy manufacturing, is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe are in the process of expanding our development, regulatory, and sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nIn connection with our commercialization plans and business strategy, including our continued commercialization of Translarna and Emflaza, our ongoing commercial launches of Tegsedi and Waylivra and, if approved, PTC-AADC and other product candidates, we have experienced and may to continue to experience significant growth in our employee base for sales, marketing, operational, managerial, financial, human resources, drug development, quality, regulatory and medical affairs and other areas. This growth has imposed and will continue to impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to recruit, hire, retain, motivate and integrate additional employees, including\nemployees who joined us in connection with any of our acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Also, our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities, including any applicable integration. To manage our recent and anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. In addition, we may need to adjust the size of our workforce as a result of changes to our expectations for our business, which can result in diversion of management attention, disruptions to our business, and related expenses. For example, following our receipt of the Refuse to File letter from the FDA in 2016, we implemented a reorganization of our operations in March 2016 that resulted in a one-time charge for the related work-force reduction. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection or other intellectual property rights in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. One primary way that we seek to protect our proprietary position is by filing patent applications in the United States and in certain ex-U.S. jurisdictions related to our novel technologies, product and product candidates that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output or miss an opportunity to file a patent application. Moreover, if we license technology or product candidates from third parties in the future, these license agreements may not permit us to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patents, covering this intellectual property. These agreements could also give our licensors the right to enforce the licensed patents without our involvement, or to decide not to enforce the patents at all. Therefore, in these circumstances, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nThe laws of ex-U.S. countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, patent law in many countries restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain or be able to pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, currently, the first to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. However, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011, or the Act, which reformed certain patent laws in the U.S., may create additional uncertainty. The significant changes engendered by the Act include switching from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-\nto-file\u201d system, and the implementation of new procedures that permit competitors to challenge our patents in the USPTO after grant, including inter partes review and post grant review.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third party anonymously submitting prior art to a patent office or may become involved in addressing patentability objections based on third-party submission of references, or may become involved in oppositions, derivation proceedings, reexamination, inter partes review, post grant review, interference proceedings or other patent office proceedings or litigation, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize our product or current or future product candidates.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. In addition, other companies may attempt to circumvent any regulatory data protection or market exclusivity that we obtain under applicable legislation, which may require us to allocate significant resources to prevent such circumvention. Legal and regulatory developments in the EU and elsewhere may also result in clinical trial data and other information, that would ordinarily be treated as trade secret, submitted as part of a marketing authorization application becoming publicly available. The EMA Policy on publication of clinical data and other such information, as well as the current application of EU freedom of information regulations, could impact our proprietary information (comprising both clinical and non-clinical data and other information) that would normally be maintained by a regulatory body as commercially confidential. Such developments could enable other companies to circumvent our intellectual property rights and use our clinical trial data or other information to obtain marketing authorizations in the EU and in other jurisdictions where we have not been able to obtain any intellectual property or regulatory protection, resulting in loss of market share. Such developments may also require us to allocate significant resources or engage in litigation to prevent other companies from circumventing or violating our intellectual property rights. Our attempts to prevent third parties from circumventing our intellectual property and other rights may ultimately be unsuccessful. We may also fail to take the required actions or pay the necessary fees to maintain our patents.\nFor example, during 2015, we were notified by the EMA that it had received from another pharmaceutical company a request under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 seeking access to aspects of our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Following the decision of the EMA to release such documentation with only minimal redactions we initiated litigation before the General Court of the EU to prevent disclosure of this information. In the first quarter of 2018, the Court ruled in favor of the EMA, allowing the EMA to release the documentation. We appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the CJEU but the CJEU dismissed our appeal in January 2020 and released the information to the requester.\nAn issued patent may be challenged as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged on such a basis in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file a lawsuit and claims for damages, which can be expensive\nand time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property or defenses, such that they do not infringe our intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that our patents are invalid and unenforceable or that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceeding, inter partes review or post-grant review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The risks of being involved in such litigation and proceedings may also increase as our product candidates are disclosed while approaching commercialization, and as we gain greater visibility as a public company. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product and our product candidates. Since patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, with new publications occurring continuously, there may be patents or patent applications relating to our product or our product candidates that we are unaware of. There may also be pending or future patent applications that, if issued, would block us from commercializing our commercial products. Thus, we do not know with certainty whether any of our products or product candidates, or our commercialization thereof, would or would not infringe any third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, or in order to avoid or settle litigation, we could be required to obtain a license to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us, and could require us to make substantial payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing an alleged infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our products or our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nFor example, it is possible that one or more third parties might bring a patent infringement or other legal proceeding against us regarding Translarna or Emflaza. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any issued U.S. patent that may allegedly include ataluren or deflazacort within the scope of a granted claim, we would need to overcome that patent\u2019s presumption of validity in district court or prove unpatentability by a preponderance of the evidence before the USPTO. There is no assurance that a court or the USPTO would find these claims to be invalid or unpatentable, respectively. In addition, we believe that the public notice given by our testing of ataluren in clinical trials for the purpose of seeking FDA approval would be a valid defense against any infringement claims in the United States prior to commercialization based on the availability of any statutory research exemptions. However, there can be no assurance that our interpretation of the exemption would be upheld.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary\ninformation or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWithout patent protection, our marketed products may face generic competition.\nCertain of the products we market have no or limited patent protection and, as a result, potential competitors face fewer regulatory barriers in introducing competing products. Without patent protection or other regulatory exclusivity, we may not be able to exclude others from, among other things, selling or importing similar products in any jurisdiction. In some instances, we may rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our commercial position with respect to such products, although we may be unable to provide adequate protection for our commercial position via these means. In other instances, we may need to rely on regulatory exclusivity to protect our commercial position.\nFurthermore, generic competition against a branded product often results in decreases in the prices at which the branded product can be sold, particularly when there is more than one generic product available in the marketplace. Third-party companies could also develop products that are similar, but not identical, to our marketed products, such as an alternative formulation of our product or an alternative formulation combined with a different delivery technology, and seek approval in the United States by referencing our products and relying, to some degree, on the FDA\u2019s finding that our products are safe and effective in their approved indications. In addition, legislation enacted in the United States allows for, and in a few instances, in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician, mandates the dispensing of generic products rather than branded products where a generic version is available.\nOn February 9, 2017, the FDA approved the corticosteroid Emflaza for the treatment of patients 5 years and older with DMD. Although approved for other indications outside of the United States, this was the first approval for deflazacort in the United States and the first approval in the United States for the use of a corticosteroid to treat DMD. Emflaza\u2019s seven-year period of orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older expires in February 2024. Emflaza\u2019s orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients two years of age to less than five expires in June 2026.\nWe rely on regulatory exclusivity for Emflaza and currently have no issued patents that could prevent a third-party company from seeking to introduce a generic Emflaza formulation in the United States for the treatment of DMD or another indication, and we may never be able to obtain such patent protection. Such third-party companies may also obtain patents covering a new deflazacort formulation or method of use.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents and regulatory exclusivity for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. More particularly, we may rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our competitive position related to our products and product candidates, especially when patent protection is not obtainable. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors, partners and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be obtained or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed. If our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, employees, consultants, advisors, partners and other third parties develop new inventions or processes related to our products independently, or jointly with us, that may be applicable to our products under development, disputes may arise about ownership or proprietary rights to those inventions and processes. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our inventions or trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside of the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nOur trademark applications may be refused registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or may be found to be unenforceable. During trademark examination proceedings, our trademark applications may be rejected. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may not be able to overcome them. In addition, in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and Trademark Offices in many other jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications or to seek cancellation of registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. In addition, if we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter difficulty enforcing our trademark rights against third parties in the jurisdictions where we do not have registered rights.\nIf we are not able to obtain adequate trademark protection or regulatory approval for our brand names, we may be required to re-brand affected products, which could cause delays in getting such products to market and substantially increase our costs.\nTo protect our rights in any trademark we intend to use for our products or product candidates, we may seek to register such trademarks. Trademark registration is territory-specific and we must apply for trademark registration in the United States as well as any other country where we intend to commercialize our product or product candidates. Failure to obtain trademark registrations may place our use of the trademarks at risk or make them subject to legal challenges, which could force us to choose alternative names for our product or product candidates. In addition, the FDA, and other regulatory\nauthorities outside the United States, conduct an independent review of proposed product names for pharmaceuticals, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other pharmaceutical product names for medications, which could result in medication errors in prescribing, dispensing and consumption. These regulatory authorities may also object to a proposed product name if they believe the name inappropriately makes or implies a therapeutic claim. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities outside the United States object to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt alternative names for our product or product candidates. If we adopt alternative names, either because of our inability to obtain a trademark registration or because of objections from regulatory authorities, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications and the rights attached thereto. Consequently, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to adopt a new product name that would be registrable under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA and other regulatory authorities, which could cause delays in getting our products to market and substantially increase our costs. Furthermore, in the United States and many other jurisdictions, a trademark registration may be cancelled through cancellation or forfeiture proceedings brought by a third party or from non-use of the trademark in that jurisdiction. We may not be able to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product or our product candidates.\nOur rights to develop and commercialize PTC-AADC and our other gene therapy product candidates are subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by others.\nWe depend upon the intellectual property rights granted to us under licenses from third parties that are important or necessary to the development of PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency and our other gene therapy product candidates. In particular, we have in-licensed certain intellectual property rights and know-how from the NTU relevant to PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency. Any termination of these licenses could result in the loss of significant or all rights licensed to us and could harm or prevent our ability to commercialize PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency and our other gene therapy product candidates. Each of our existing gene therapy licensing agreements are exclusive but are limited to particular fields, such as AADC deficiency and are subject to certain retained rights.\nOur current gene therapy license agreements, including our agreement with NTU pursuant to which we have in-licensed certain intellectual property rights and know-how relevant to PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, or the License Agreement, impose various obligations, including certain payment obligations, including contingent payments to be made upon reaching certain development and regulatory milestones. If we fail to satisfy our obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the agreement. Disputes may arise between us and any of our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to such agreements and other issues. Such disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed or the terms of our license agreements, including with respect to PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, may prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all, or may impair the value of the arrangement to us. Any such dispute could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Agilis. If we cannot maintain a necessary license agreement, including with respect to PTC-AADC for the treatment of AADC deficiency, or if the agreement is terminated, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements and expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. Our existing licenses impose, and we expect that future licenses will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by these agreements, which could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under such license agreement. Termination of these license agreements or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms or cause us to lose rights in important intellectual property or technology.\nWe have also received grant funding for some of our development programs from philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups pursuant to agreements that impose development and commercialization diligence obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the applicable organization could require us to grant to the organization exclusive\nrights under certain of our intellectual property, which could materially adversely affect the value to us of product candidates covered by that intellectual property even if we are entitled to a share of any consideration received by such organization in connection with any subsequent development or commercialization of the product candidates.\nSome of our patented technology was developed with U.S. federal government funding. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights to use or allow third parties to use our patented technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the U.S. government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, U.S. government-funded inventions must be reported to the government and U.S. government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications. Furthermore, our rights in such inventions are subject to government license rights and certain restrictions on manufacturing products outside the United States.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nServicing the Convertible Notes requires a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our debt, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of, or to repurchase, the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn August 2015, we incurred indebtedness in the amount of $150.0 million in aggregate principal with additional accrued interest under the 2022 Convertible Notes, for which interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2016. The 2022 Convertible Notes will mature on August 15, 2022 and we will be required to pay any outstanding principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes at that time, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date. As of February 15, 2022, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or any combination thereof at our election. In September 2019, we incurred indebtedness in the amount of $287.5 million in aggregate principal with additional accrued interest under the 2026 Convertible Notes, for which interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance the Convertible Notes depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt, including the Convertible Notes. If we are unable to generate cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be unfavorable to us or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we seek to refinance such indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nUpon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase Convertible Notes, to pay the Convertible Notes at maturity or to pay cash upon conversions of Convertible Notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture, to make interest payments on the Convertible Notes when due under the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under each indenture governing the Convertible Notes. An event of default under the applicable indenture governing the Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of any such related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace\nperiods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, repurchase the Convertible Notes, make interest payments on the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, we have reclassified all of the outstanding principal of the 2022 Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability in accordance with applicable accounting rules, resulting in a material reduction of our net working capital. Similarly, even if holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes do not elect to convert their 2026 Convertible Notes, we could be required to make the same reclassification under applicable accounting rules of the 2026 Convertible Notes, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u25cf provide for a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u25cf allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u25cf limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u25cf require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u25cf limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u25cf require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock and lawsuits against us and our officers and directors.\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf expectations with respect to our gene therapy platform, including any potential regulatory submissions and potential approvals, including those related to PTC-AADC;\n\u25cf the commercialization of Evrysdi and the development of the SMA program with Roche and the SMA Foundation;\n\u25cf any developments related to our ability or inability to execute our commercialization strategy for any of our products;\n\u25cf our ability to resolve the matters set forth in the FDA\u2019s denial of our appeal to the Complete Response Letter we received from the FDA in connection with our NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, and our ability to perform additional clinical trials, non-clinical studies or CMC assessments or analyses at significant cost;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in Brazil, Russia and in the EEA, which is subject to the specific obligation to conduct Study 041 and is also subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization by the EMA;\n\u25cf any developments related to Study 041, including with respect to design, timing, conduct, and enrollment, and developments with respect to any clinical or non-clinical trial required by other regulatory agencies, including the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u25cf results of clinical trials of any other product candidate that we develop;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, licenses, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u25cf negative publicity around our products or product candidates;\n\u25cf other developments concerning our regulatory submissions;\n\u25cf whether regulators in other territories agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD;\n\u25cf the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf results of clinical trials of product candidates of our competitors, including negative results that investors may associate with our product candidates;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf our ability to realize the benefits of our acquisitions or other business combinations;\n\u25cf the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf the loss of distributors, suppliers or manufacturers;\n\u25cf the level of expenses related to any of our products, product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf announcements with respect to litigation;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u25cf market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u25cf general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nCompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have frequently been the subject of securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation. For example, in 2018 we settled a securities class action lawsuit initiated against us and certain of our current and former executive officers during 2016, as well as derivative lawsuits brought against us, as a nominal defendant, certain of our current and former executive officers and certain of our current and former directors during 2017. We could be the target of other such litigation in the future. Class action and derivative lawsuits, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs, damage or settlement awards and a diversion of our management\u2019s resources and attention from running our business, which could materially harm our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently incurring and expect to continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and our management is and will continue to be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives. In addition, the failure to establish and maintain adequate finance infrastructure and accounting systems and controls could impair our ability to comply with the financial reporting and internal controls requirements for publicly traded companies.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel have and will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will continue to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations have made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nPursuant to Section 404 Sarbanes-Oxley, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. Compliance with Section 404, including documentation and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, is both costly and challenging. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner each year, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our stockholders sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the development and growth of our business. The terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock or the sale of shares of our common stock by our stockholders could dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in the Company and could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe have issued a significant number of equity awards under our equity compensation plans or as inducement grants to new hire employees pursuant to Nasdaq rules. The shares underlying these awards are registered on a Form S-8 registration statement. As a result, upon vesting these shares can be freely exercised and sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. The exercise of options and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock or the sale of restricted stock upon vesting could cause a decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nCertain of our employees, executive officers and directors have entered or may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans providing for sales of shares of our common stock from time to time. Under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the employee, director or officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from the employee, officer or director. A Rule 10b5-1 plan may be amended or terminated in some circumstances. Our employees, executive officers and directors may also buy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material, nonpublic information.\nAdditionally, certain shares that we issued in connection with our acquisitions or other strategic transactions have not yet been sold and are currently restricted as a result of securities laws. These shares may be freely sold in the public market subject to any requirements and restrictions, including any applicable volume limitations, imposed by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The sale or resale of these shares in the public market, or the market\u2019s expectation of such sales, may result in an immediate and substantial decline in our stock price. Such a decline will adversely affect our investors and also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or other securities by our stockholders or by us, including sales made under the Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $125 million from time to time, through the Sales Agent by any method that is deemed to be an \u201cat the market\u201d offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act, or the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our outstanding Convertible Notes or any future securities convertible or exchangeable into our common stock or in connection with a strategic transaction or otherwise, could dilute our stockholders, lower the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities.", "PERMNO": 13967, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PTCT"}
