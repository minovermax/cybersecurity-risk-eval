{"cik": "1421182", "company": "Verso Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks. Set forth below are certain of the more important risks that we face and that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results. Our business could also be affected by other risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe are immaterial to our business.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nThe paper industry has been facing a long-term structural decline and our profitability may continue to be adversely impacted by such decline.\nThe coated papers industry faces a long-term, structural decline. From 2016 to 2019, demand for printing and writing papers in North America fell by roughly 20%. North America demand for coated freesheet has declined 22% from 2016 to 2019. Similarly, North America demand for coated groundwood has declined 33% from 2016 to 2019. The demand for coated papers is expected to continue to steadily decline in the future, with market volumes in 2020 projected to be 6% below 2019 levels.\nAdverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products, our financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. During an economic downturn, end-users may reduce magazine subscriptions, contributing to lower demand for our products and advertising in printed magazines and catalogs may also decline, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, volatility in the capital and credit markets, which impacts interest and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulations and monetary, tax and trade policy, among other things could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. While it is not possible to predict whether and\nwhen any such changes will occur, changes at the local, state or federal level could significantly impact our business and the industry in which we compete.\nForeign overcapacity could also result in an increase in the supply of paper products available in the North American market. An increased supply of paper available in North America could put downward pressure on prices and/or cause us to lose sales to competitors, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDevelopments in alternative media could adversely affect the demand for our products.\nTrends in advertising, electronic data transmission and storage and the internet have had and likely will continue to have adverse effects on traditional print media, including the use of and demand for our products and those of our customers. Our magazine and catalog publishing customers may increasingly use (both for content and advertising), and compete with businesses that use, other forms of media and advertising and electronic data transmission and storage, particularly the internet, instead of paper made by us. As the use of these alternative media continues to grow, the demand for our paper products will likely continue to decline.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive.\nCompetition in our industry is based largely on price. We compete with foreign producers, some of which are lower-cost producers than we are or are subsidized by certain foreign governments. We also face competition from numerous North American coated papers manufacturers. Some of our competitors have advantages over us, including lower raw material and labor costs and may be subject to fewer environmental and governmental regulations.\nFurthermore, due to the trend toward consolidation in our industry, some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do or may be better positioned than we are to compete for certain opportunities. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively in the markets we serve.\nCompetition could cause us to lower our prices or lose sales to competitors, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to compete will be affected by product availability, the quality of our products, our breadth of product offerings, our ability to maintain mill efficiencies and to achieve high operating rates, manufacturing costs, our ability to distribute our products on time and availability and/or cost of wood fiber, market pulp, chemicals, energy, other raw materials and labor.\nWe will be unable to compete with respect to certain specialty paper products for a period of two years after the closing of the Pixelle Sale.\nThe Purchase Agreement entered into in connection with the Pixelle Sale provides that for a period of two years beginning on the closing date of February 10, 2020, Verso and its affiliates (excluding stockholders of Verso) have agreed not to engage in, own, operate or assist any other business or person in engaging in the business of designing, manufacturing, and selling any specialty paper products related to: (i) coated thermal transfer papers manufactured and sold at the Stevens Point Mill, (ii) coated direct thermal base papers manufactured and sold at the Stevens Point Mill or (iii) uncoated flexible packaging manufactured and sold at the Androscoggin Mill, subject to customary exceptions as outlined in the Purchase Agreement. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing business opportunities that would be attractive to us or our stockholders.\nBecause our operations at our Androscoggin Mill and our Stevens Point Mill collectively represented approximately 22% of our revenues over the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our business following the sale of these mills and the closing of the Pixelle Sale will be reduced and less diversified.\nThe reduction in the scale and scope of our business as a result of the Pixelle Sale will expose a larger portion of our business to the type of risks associated with the market for graphic papers. In addition, a greater portion of our product line will now be exposed to greater secular and cyclical risks associated with our business. If these difficulties or challenges cannot be overcome, our business may not be successful and they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our business. Furthermore, we may have credit exposure to these customers through extension of trade credits.\nOur two largest customers, Veritiv Corporation and Central National-Gottesman, together accounted for 25% of our net sales in 2019. In 2019, our ten largest customers (including Veritiv Corporation and Central National-Gottesman) together accounted for 60% of our net sales. The loss of, or reduction in orders from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as could significant customer disputes regarding shipments, price, quality, or other matters.\nIn addition, we generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers that ensure a continuing level of business from them. Our agreements with our customers are not exclusive and generally do not contain minimum volume purchase commitments. Our relationship with our customers will depend on our ability to continue to meet their needs for quality products and services at competitive prices. If we lose customers or if we experience a significant decline in sales volume, we may not be able to quickly replace the lost revenue and our operating results and business could be affected.\nFurthermore, we extend trade credit to certain of these customers to facilitate the purchase of our products, and we rely on these customers\u2019 creditworthiness and ability to obtain credit from lenders. Accordingly, a bankruptcy or a significant deterioration in the financial condition of any of these significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, due to a reduction in sales, a longer collection cycle or an inability to collect accounts receivable.\nWe have limited ability to control the pricing of our products or pass through increases in our costs to our customers.\nOur earnings are sensitive to price changes in coated papers. Fluctuations in paper prices (and coated papers prices in particular) historically have had a direct effect on our net income (loss) and EBITDA for several reasons:\n\u2022\nMarket prices for paper products are a function of supply and demand, factors over which we have limited control. We therefore have limited ability to control the pricing of our products. Market prices of grade No. 3, 60 lb. basis weight paper, which is an industry benchmark for coated freesheet papers pricing, have fluctuated since 2000 from a high of $1,105 per ton to a low of $740 per ton. In addition, since 2000, market prices of grade No. 4, 50 lb. basis weight paper, which is an industry benchmark for coated groundwood papers pricing, have fluctuated between a high of $1,075 per ton to a low of $710 per ton over the same period. As market conditions determine the price for our paper products, the price for our products could fall below our cash production costs.\n\u2022\nMarket prices for paper products typically are not directly affected by raw material costs or other costs of sales, and consequently we have limited ability to pass through increases in these raw materials and/or other sales costs to our customers absent increases in the market price. Thus, even though our costs may increase, we may not have the ability to increase the prices for our products or the prices for our products may decline.\n\u2022\nThe manufacturing of coated papers is highly capital-intensive and a large portion of our operating costs are fixed. Additionally, paper machines are large, complex machines that are more efficient when operated continuously. Consequently, both we and our competitors typically continue to run our machines whenever marginal sales exceed the marginal costs, adversely impacting prices at times of lower demand.\nTherefore, our ability to achieve acceptable margins is principally dependent on (a) our cost structure, (b) changes in the prices of raw materials, electricity, energy and fuel, which will represent a large component of our operating costs and will fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control and (c) general conditions in the paper market including the demand for paper products, the amount of foreign imports, the amount spent on advertising, the circulation of magazines and catalogs, the use of electronic readers and other devices and postal rates. Any one or more of these economic conditions could affect our sales and operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are involved in continuous manufacturing processes with a high degree of fixed costs. Any interruption in the operations of our manufacturing facilities may affect our operating performance.\nWe run our paper machines on a nearly continuous basis for maximum efficiency. Any downtime at any of our paper mills, including as a result of or in connection with planned maintenance and capital expenditure projects, results in unabsorbed fixed costs that could negatively affect our results of operations for the period in which we experience the downtime. Due to the extreme operating conditions inherent in some of our manufacturing processes, we may incur unplanned business interruptions from time to time due to, among other things, transportation interruptions and mechanical, power or structural failures at our facilities. As a result, we may not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our operational needs. In addition, the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct our business may be affected by natural disasters, including snow storms, forest fires and flooding. Such natural disasters could cause our mills to stop running, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, during periods of weak demand for paper products or periods of rising costs, we have experienced and may in the future experience market-related downtime, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to record significant closure costs and long-lived asset impairment or accelerated depreciation charges.\nWe have responded to changing market dynamics by optimizing assets and streamlining our production, including idling or shutting down certain paper machines and facilities. For example, in April 2019, we announced the permanent shutdown of the Luke Mill; in November 2016, we announced the closure of our Memphis office headquarters and relocation of our Corporate headquarters to Miamisburg, Ohio; in August 2015, we announced plans to shut down the No. 1 pulp dryer and No. 2 paper machine at our Androscoggin Mill in Jay, Maine, and to indefinitely idle our mill in Wickliffe, Kentucky; in April 2016, we announced our decision to permanently close the mill in Wickliffe, Kentucky. If demand for our products continues to decline, or if the pace of decline accelerates, it may be necessary to curtail production even further or permanently shut down certain machines and facilities. In addition to the potential loss of production, curtailments and shutdowns could result in asset impairments or accelerated depreciation and cash closure costs for the affected facilities, including restructuring charges and exit or disposal costs, which could negatively impact our cash flows and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLosses related to the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used are recognized when circumstances, such as continuing losses or demand declines in certain businesses, indicate the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. When indicators that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the asset group in relation to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of an asset group is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset group, an impairment charge is recognized based on the excess of the asset group\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. If it is determined that the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable, we review and adjust, as necessary, the estimated useful lives of the assets in the group. If there were to be a triggering event, it is possible that we could record non-cash long-lived asset impairment or accelerated depreciation charges in future periods, which would be recorded as operating expenses and would directly and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain energy or raw materials, including petroleum-based chemicals, at favorable prices or at all.\nWe purchase substantial amounts of energy, wood fiber, market pulp, chemicals and other raw materials from third parties. We may experience shortages of energy supplies or raw materials or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If we are forced to seek alternative sources of supply, we may not be able to do so on terms as favorable as our current terms or at all. The prices for energy and many of our raw materials, especially petroleum-based chemicals, have been volatile and may be volatile in the future. Chemical suppliers that use petroleum-based products in the manufacture of their chemicals may, due to a supply shortage and cost increase, ration the amount of chemicals available to us and/or we may not be able to obtain the chemicals we need to operate our business at favorable prices, if at all. In addition, certain specialty chemicals that we currently purchase are available only from a small number of suppliers. If any of these suppliers were to cease operations or cease doing business with us in the future, we may be unable to obtain such chemicals at favorable prices, if at all.\nThe supply of energy or raw materials may be adversely affected by, among other things, natural disasters or an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the United States and any foreign power, and, in particular, events in the Middle East or weather events such as hurricanes could result in a real or perceived shortage of oil or natural gas, which could result in an increase in energy or chemical prices. In addition, wood fiber is a commodity and prices historically have been cyclical. The primary source for wood fiber is timber. Environmental litigation and regulatory developments have caused, and may cause in the future, significant reductions in the amount of timber available for commercial harvest in Canada and the United States. In\naddition, future domestic or foreign legislation, litigation advanced by aboriginal groups, litigation concerning the use of timberlands, the protection of endangered species, the promotion of forest biodiversity and the response to and prevention of wildfires and campaigns or other measures by environmental activists also could affect timber supplies. The availability of harvested timber may further be limited by factors such as fire and fire prevention, insect infestation, disease, ice and wind storms, droughts, floods and other natural and man-made causes. Additionally, due to increased fuel costs, suppliers, distributors and freight carriers have charged fuel surcharges, which have increased our costs. Any significant shortage or significant increase in our energy or raw material costs in circumstances where we cannot raise the price of our products due to market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny disruption in the supply of energy or raw materials also could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation. As we have limited ability to pass through increases in our costs to our customers absent increases in market prices for our products, material increases in the cost of our raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may be required to post letters of credit or other financial assurance obligations with certain of our energy and other suppliers, which could limit our financial flexibility.\nWe may not realize certain projected cost savings or productivity improvements, which could result in lower profitability for our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we identify opportunities to improve profitability by reducing costs and enhancing productivity. For example, through our continuous process improvement program, we have implemented focused programs to optimize material and energy sourcing and usage, reduce repair costs and control overhead. We will continue to utilize the process improvement program to drive cost reductions and operating improvements in our mill system and have targeted additional profitability enhancements in the next twelve months. Our strategy assumes that increases in productivity through our continuous process improvement program, including through a more efficient manufacturing process or engineering design enhancements, will result in economies of scale, and global competitive sourcing of our materials will reduce our raw material and other costs. Any cost savings or productivity enhancements that we expect to realize from such efforts may differ materially from our estimates. Cost savings or productivity enhancements that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in pricing or volume, or through increases in other expenses, including wood, chemicals and energy. We cannot assure you that these initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that the benefits we expect will be achieved on a timely basis, or at all.\nCurrency fluctuations may adversely affect our competitive position and selling prices.\nWe compete with producers from around the world, particularly in North America. In addition to the impact of product supply and demand, changes in the relative strength or weakness of international currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, can also affect international trade flows in certain products. A stronger U.S. dollar may attract imports, thereby increasing product supply and possibly creating downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a weaker U.S. dollar might encourage U.S. exports, thereby decreasing product supply and possibly creating upward pressure on prices.\nAll members of our current Board of Directors were appointed in the last six months, and the transition to a new Board of Directors will be critical to our success.\nAll of our current directors were appointed or elected to our Board of Directors in the last six months and they are expanding their knowledge of our operations and strategic plans. The ability of our new directors to quickly expand their knowledge of our business plans, operations, strategies and technologies will be critical to their ability to make informed decisions about our strategy and operations, particularly given the competitive environment in which our business operates and the need to quickly adjust to technological trends and advancements. Our ability to compete effectively and profitably could be adversely affected if we are not successful in execution of our strategy.\nOur business may suffer if we do not retain our senior management and other key personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss of services of members of our senior management team and other key personnel could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ qualified personnel on acceptable terms. In addition, our future success requires us to continue to attract and retain competent personnel. Any failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and require the incurrence of substantial additional costs to recruit replacement personnel.\nWork stoppages and slowdowns and legal action by our unionized employees may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 3,700 employees. Approximately 65% of our hourly workforce is represented by 16 local branches of the following unions: the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Services Workers International Union; the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; the Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America; the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; the Office and Professional Employees International Union; and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry. On February 28, 2019, the USW, who represent employees at four Verso sites, voted to ratify a new Master Labor Agreement covering five USW local branches, or approximately 80% of Verso\u2019s hourly represented workforce as of December 31, 2019. The Agreement, which was effective on March 1, 2019, will run for a period of three years with staggered expiration dates at each of the affected sites. In addition, two smaller local unions (the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters) at two of the mill locations also signed and are participating in the Agreement. The remaining four smaller trade unions at two of the mill sites ratified new agreements in the fourth quarter 2019. We may become subject to material cost increases as a result of future actions taken by the labor unions. This could increase expenses in absolute terms and/or as a percentage of net sales. In addition, although we believe we have a good relationship with our employees, work stoppages or other labor disturbances may occur in the future. Any of these factors could lead to operational delays or increased costs, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure may interfere with our operations and could compromise our information and the information of our customers and suppliers, exposing us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from customers. We use information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, the propriety business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and disaster recovery plans, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to security breaches, including those caused by physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, malware, attacks by hackers, employee error and disruptions caused from unauthorized access and tampering, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. In addition, we believe cyberattack attempts are increasing in number and that cyber attackers are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only access and attack systems, but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties for certain transportation services.\nWe rely primarily on third parties for transportation of our products to our customers and transportation of our raw materials to us, in particular, by truck and train. The transportation industry is subject to legislative and regulatory changes that can affect the economics of those third-party transportation providers by requiring changes in their operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the cost of providing transportation services. If any third-party transportation provider fails to deliver our products in a timely manner, we may be unable to sell them at full value. Similarly, if any transportation provider fails to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture our products on a timely basis. Shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed due to weather conditions, strikes or other events. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or products in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively impact our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis could be adversely affected by the lack of adequate availability of transportation services, especially rail capacity, whether because of work stoppages or otherwise. If any of these third-party transportation providers were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost. Furthermore, we may experience increases in the cost of our transportation services as a result of rising fuel costs and surcharges (primarily in diesel fuel). Since we have a limited ability to pass these increased costs through to our customers, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs or other liabilities upon us.\nWe are subject to a wide range of federal, state, regional and local general and industry-specific environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions (including greenhouse gases and hazardous air pollutants), wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management and disposal, site remediation and natural resources. Compliance with these laws and regulations, and permits issued thereunder, is a significant factor in our business and may be subject to the same or even increased scrutiny and enforcement actions by regulators. We have made, and will continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these requirements and permits, which may impose increasingly more stringent standards over time as they are renewed or modified by the applicable governmental authorities. In addition, we handle and dispose of waste arising from our mill operations and operate a number of on-site landfills to handle that waste. We are required to maintain financial assurance (in the form of letters of credit and other similar instruments) for the projected cost of closure and post-closure care for certain landfill operations. We could be subject to potentially significant fines, penalties, criminal sanctions, plant shutdowns or interruptions in operations for any failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits. Moreover, under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property, and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of at real property, may be held liable for the full cost to investigate or clean up such real property and for related damages to natural resources. We may be subject to liability, including liability for investigation and cleanup costs, if contamination is discovered at one of our current or former paper mills, other properties or other locations where we have disposed of or arranged for the disposal of waste.\nActions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe were the target of activist stockholder activities in 2019 and early 2020. If these activities were to recur, our business could be adversely affected because (i) responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees and (ii) perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership caused by activist activities may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, suppliers and other strategic partners, and cause our price of our common stock to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.\nWe may from time to time pursue opportunistic acquisitions the success of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the past, we have pursued acquisitions to complement or expand our business. If we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired businesses with our existing business and services. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, amortization expenses and goodwill. The negotiation of any transaction, its completion and subsequent integration of any business acquired may be complex and time consuming, involve significant costs and may result in a distraction of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations. We may be affected materially and adversely if we are unable to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire. Similarly, we may divest portions of our business, which may also have material and adverse effects.\nWe may incur debt from time to time under our ABL Facility and we also may incur additional debt through other means.\nWe had $276 million of borrowing availability under our ABL Facility (as defined below) as of December 31, 2019. We also may incur additional debt in the future through other means. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our current or future debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or dilutive.\nFinancial covenants and restrictions under our ABL Facility could result in an event of default or limit our ability to pursue business strategies and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the ABL Facility, we are required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio when the excess availability under such facility is less than the greater of (a) 10% of the lesser of (i) the borrowing base at such time and (ii) the aggregate amount of revolving facility commitments at such time or (b) $27.5 million.\nThe ABL Facility also contains certain covenants which, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict Verso Paper and certain of its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional debt or liens, pay dividends, repurchase equity interests, prepay other indebtedness, sell, transfer, lease or dispose of assets and make investments in or merge with another company, make capital expenditures, enter into sale and leaseback provisions, engage or enter into any new line of business, enter into transactions with our affiliates; or amend or modify certain provisions of our, and our subsidiaries\u2019, organizational documents.\nIf we were to violate any of the covenants under the ABL Facility and were unable to obtain a waiver, it would be considered a default after the expiration of any applicable grace period and no additional borrowings would be available until the default was waived or cured. If we were in default under the ABL Facility, then the lenders thereunder may exercise remedies under such facility in accordance with the terms thereof, including declaring all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable and the termination any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the lenders thereunder will also have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness. If such indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full our secured indebtedness.\nCertain covenants also apply to, and similarly restrict the operations of, Verso Holding. Any default under our ABL Facility could adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due.\nWe have certain material pension obligations. Future funding obligations related to these obligations could restrict cash available for our operations, capital expenditures or other requirements or require us to borrow additional funds.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have a defined benefit pension plan covering approximately 64% of our employees. As of December 31, 2015, all of our defined benefit pension plans were frozen to new entrants. As of December 31, 2019, the projected benefit obligation for our pension plan was $1,542 million and the fair value of the pension plan assets was $1,173 million. The total underfunded status of the pension obligation calculated on a projected benefit obligation basis as of December 31, 2019 was $369 million. In connection with the Pixelle Sale on February 10, 2020, Pixelle assumed approximately $35 million of Verso\u2019s unfunded pension liabilities (see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2020, we expect to make cash contributions to the pension plan of $54 million (see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). A deterioration in the value of plan assets could cause the unfunded status of the pension plan to increase, thereby increasing our obligation to make additional contributions to the plan. In addition, we will require future operating cash flows to fund our pension obligations, which could restrict available cash for our operations, capital expenditures and other requirements. We also may not generate sufficient cash to satisfy these obligations, which could require us to seek funding from other sources, including through additional borrowings, which could materially increase our outstanding debt or debt service requirements.\nLitigation could be costly and harmful to our business.\nWe are involved, from time to time, in claims and legal proceedings relating to contractual, employment, environmental, intellectual property and other matters incidental to the conduct of our business. Although we do not believe that any currently pending claims or legal proceedings are likely to result in an unfavorable outcome that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, we may become involved in such claims and legal proceedings in the future that could result in unfavorable outcomes and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Verso\u2019s Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile and stockholders may be unable to sell shares at or above the price at which they purchased them.\nSince January 1, 2019 to the date of filing this annual report on Form 10-K, our Class A common stock price ranged from $9.61 per share to $26.18 per share. The market price of our common stock may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares of common stock. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nconditions that impact demand for our paper products;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket and industry perception of our success and competitive position within the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, dispositions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations;\n\u2022\narrival and departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us or members of our management team; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses to such events.\nThe exercise of all or any number of outstanding Plan Warrants or the issuance of stock-based awards may dilute your holding of shares of our common stock.\nAs of the date of filing this annual report on Form 10-K, we have outstanding (i) warrants to purchase 1.8 million shares of our common stock, or the \u201cPlan Warrants,\u201d at an exercise price of $27.86 that expire on July 15, 2023 and (ii) 0.9 million restricted stock units. In addition, as of the date of filing this annual report on Form 10-K, we have 2.3 million shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our Verso Corporation Performance Incentive Plan. The exercise of equity awards, including any stock options that we may grant in the future, Plan Warrants, and the sale of shares of our common stock underlying any such options or the Plan Warrants, could have an adverse effect on the market for our common stock, including the price that an investor could obtain for their shares. Investors may experience dilution in the net tangible book value of their investment upon the exercise of the Plan Warrants and any stock options that may be granted or issued pursuant to the Verso Corporation Performance Incentive Plan in the future.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws, our Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation,\u201d which became effective on July 15, 2016, and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our Board of Directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nnot providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders.\nTogether, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our Class A Common Stock. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of the Company, thereby potentially reducing the likelihood that our stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to alternative forums, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us by our directors, officers, or stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law or to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. We may consent in writing to alternative forums. This exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The exclusive forum provision in our Certificate of Incorporation does not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders are not deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nThis choice of forum provision in our Certificate of Incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us, which may discourage lawsuits against Verso and our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to Verso than to our stockholders. However, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find this type of provision to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in Verso\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, Verso might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 92670, "SIC": 2621, "TIC": "VRS"}
