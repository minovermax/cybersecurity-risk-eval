RISK FACTORS\nEach of the Registrants operates in a market and regulatory environment that poses significant risks, many of which are beyond that Registrant\u2019s control. Management of each Registrant regularly meets with the Chief Risk Officer and the RMC, which comprises officers of the Registrants, to identify and evaluate the most significant risks of the Registrants\u2019 businesses, and the appropriate steps to manage and mitigate those risks. The Chief Risk Officer and senior executives of the Registrants discuss those risks with the finance and risk committee and audit committee of the Exelon board of directors and the ComEd, PECO and BGE boards of directors. In addition, the generation oversight committee of the Exelon board of directors evaluates risks related to the generation business. The risk factors discussed below may adversely affect one or more of the Registrants\u2019 results of operations and cash flows and the market prices of their publicly traded securities. Each of the Registrants has disclosed the known material risks that affect its business at this time. However, there may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed by a Registrant to be material that may adversely affect its performance or financial condition in the future.\nExelon\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are affected to a significant degree by: (1) Generation\u2019s position as a predominantly nuclear generator selling power into competitive energy markets with a concentration in select regions, and (2) the role of ComEd, PECO and BGE as operators of electric transmission and distribution systems in three of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States. Factors that affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Registrants fall primarily under the following categories, all of which are discussed in further detail below:\n\u2022\nMarket and Financial Factors. Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s results of operations are affected by price fluctuations in the energy markets. Power prices are a function of supply and demand, which in turn are driven by factors such as (1) the price of fuels, in particular the price of natural gas, which affects the prices that Generation can obtain for the output of its power plants, (2) the presence of other generation resources in the markets in which Generation\u2019s output is sold, (3) the demand for electricity in the markets where the Registrants conduct their business, and (4) the impacts of on-going competition in the retail channel.\n\u2022\nRegulatory and Legislative Factors. The regulatory and legislative factors that may affect the Registrants include changes to the laws and regulations that govern competitive markets and utility cost recovery, and that drive environmental policy. In particular, Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s financial performance may be affected by changes in the design of competitive wholesale power markets or Generation\u2019s ability to sell power in those markets. In addition, potential regulation and legislation, including legislation or regulation regarding climate change and renewable portfolio standards, could have significant effects on the Registrants. Also, returns for ComEd, PECO and BGE are influenced significantly by state regulation and regulatory proceedings.\n\u2022\nOperational Factors. The Registrants\u2019 operational performance is subject to those factors inherent in running the nation\u2019s largest fleet of nuclear power reactors and large electric and gas distribution systems. The safe and effective operation of the nuclear facilities and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligations as well as the ability to maintain the availability, reliability and safety of its energy delivery systems are fundamental to Exelon\u2019s ability to protect and grow shareholder value. Additionally, the operating costs of ComEd, PECO and BGE, and the opinions of their customers and regulators, are affected by those companies\u2019 ability to maintain the reliability and safety of their energy delivery systems.\n\u2022\nRisks Related to the Pending Merger with PHI. There are various risks and uncertainties associated with the merger agreement announced with PHI on April 29, 2014.\nA discussion of each of these risk categories and other risk factors is included below.\nMarket and Financial Factors\nGeneration is exposed to depressed prices in the wholesale and retail power markets, which may negatively affect its results of operations and cash flows. (Exelon and Generation)\nGeneration is exposed to commodity price risk for the unhedged portion of its electricity generation supply portfolio. Generation\u2019s earnings and cash flows are therefore subject to variability as spot and forward market prices in the markets in which it operates rise and fall.\nPrice of Fuels: The spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. Thus, the market price of power is affected by the market price of the marginal fuel used to generate the electricity unit. Often, the next unit of electricity will be supplied from generating stations fueled by fossil fuels. Consequently, changes in the market price of fossil fuels often result in comparable changes to the market price of power. For example, the use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits has increased natural gas supply and reserves, placing downward pressure on natural gas prices and, therefore, on power prices. The continued addition of supply from new alternative generation resources, such as wind and solar, whether mandated through RPS or otherwise subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation, may displace a higher marginal cost plant, further reducing power prices. In addition, further delay or elimination of EPA air quality regulations could prolong the duration for which the cost of pollution from fossil fuel generation is not factored into market prices.\nDemand and Supply: The market price for electricity is also affected by changes in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity. Unfavorable economic conditions, milder than normal weather, and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response programs can each depress demand. The result is that higher-cost generating resources do not run as frequently, putting downward pressure on electricity market prices. The tepid economic environment in recent years and growing energy efficiency and demand response initiatives have limited the demand for electricity in Generation\u2019s markets. In addition, in some markets, the supply of electricity through wind or solar generation, when combined with other base-load generation such as nuclear, may often exceed demand during some hours of the day, resulting in loss of revenue for base-load generating plants. The risk of increased supply in excess of demand is heightened by continued or increased RPS mandates or other subsidies, including ITCs and PTCs.\nRetail Competition: Generation\u2019s retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affects the margins that Generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. In periods of sustained low natural gas and power prices and low market volatility, retail competitors can aggressively pursue market share because the barriers to entry can be low and\nwholesale generators (including Generation) use their retail operations to hedge generation output. Increased or more aggressive competition can adversely affect overall gross margins and profitability in Generation\u2019s retail operations.\nSustained low market prices or depressed demand and over-supply could adversely affect Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s results of operations and cash flows, and such impacts could be emphasized given Generation\u2019s concentration of base-load electric generating capacity within primarily two geographic market regions, namely the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic. These impacts could adversely affect Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s ability to fund other discretionary uses of cash such as growth projects or to pay dividends. In addition, such conditions may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facilities, which could adversely affect Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s results of operations through increased depreciation rates, impairment charges and accelerated future decommissioning costs which may be offset in whole or in part by reduced operating and maintenance expenses. A slow recovery in market conditions could result in a prolonged depression of or further decline in commodity prices, including low forward natural gas and power prices and low market volatility, which could also adversely affect Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nIn addition to price fluctuations, Generation is exposed to other risks in the power markets that are beyond its control and may negatively affect its results of operations. (Exelon and Generation)\nCredit Risk. In the bilateral markets, Generation is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Generation money, or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from Generation, will not perform under their obligations for operational or financial reasons. In the event the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Generation might be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale markets at less favorable prices and incur additional losses, to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In the spot markets, Generation is exposed to risk as a result of default sharing mechanisms that exist within certain markets, primarily RTOs and ISOs, the purpose of which is to spread such risk across all market participants. Generation is also a party to agreements with entities in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrades or other financial difficulties. In addition, Generation\u2019s retail sales subject it to credit risk through competitive electricity and natural gas supply activities to serve commercial and industrial companies, governmental entities and residential customers. Retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations. This risk represents the loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of a customer\u2019s account balance, as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer.\nMarket Designs. The wholesale markets remain evolving markets that vary from region to region and are still developing rules, practices and procedures. Changes in these market rules, problems with rule implementation, or failure of any of these markets could adversely affect Generation\u2019s business. In addition, a significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have a detrimental effect on market stability.\nThe Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that may over time affect or transform the energy industry, including technologies related to energy generation, distribution and consumption. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nSome of these technologies include, but are not limited to further shale gas development or sources, cost-effective renewable energy technologies, broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles and energy storage devices. Such developments could affect the price of energy, could affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, could require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions\nof our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy. Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants\u2019 results of operations, financial position, and cash flows through, among other things, reduced operating revenues, increased operating and maintenance expenses, and increased capital expenditures, as well as potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over shortened remaining asset useful lives.\nMarket performance and other factors may decrease the value of NDT funds and employee benefit plan assets and may increase the related employee benefit plan obligations, which then could require significant additional funding. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nDisruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy may adversely affect the value of the investments held within Generation\u2019s NDTs and Exelon\u2019s employee benefit plan trusts. The Registrants have significant obligations in these areas and Exelon and Generation hold substantial assets in these trusts to meet those obligations. The asset values are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants\u2019 projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the NDT fund investments may increase Generation\u2019s funding requirements to decommission its nuclear plants. A decline in the market value of the pension and OPEB plan assets will increase the funding requirements associated with Exelon\u2019s pension and OPEB plan obligations. Additionally, Exelon\u2019s pension and OPEB plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions or changes to Social Security or Medicare eligibility requirements may also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and OPEB plans. If future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets or other factors cannot be recovered, or cannot be recovered in a timely manner, from ComEd, PECO and BGE customers, the results of operations and financial positions of ComEd, PECO and BGE could be negatively affected. Ultimately, if the Registrants are unable to manage the investments with the NDT funds and benefit plan assets, and are unable to manage the related benefit plan liabilities, their results of operations, cash flows and financial positions could be negatively affected.\nUnstable capital and credit markets and increased volatility in commodity markets may adversely affect the Registrants\u2019 businesses in several ways, including the availability and cost of short-term funds for liquidity requirements, the Registrants\u2019 ability to meet long-term commitments, Generation\u2019s ability to hedge effectively its generation portfolio, and the competitiveness and liquidity of energy markets; each could adversely affect the Registrants\u2019 financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nThe Registrants rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from the Registrants\u2019 respective operations. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets in the United States or abroad can adversely affect the Registrants\u2019 ability to access the capital markets or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facilities. The Registrants\u2019 access to funds under their credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the Registrants if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from the Registrants and other borrowers within a short period of time. The inability to access capital markets or credit facilities, and longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased\nregulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures, changes to Generation\u2019s hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral-posting requirements, or a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash.\nIn addition, the Registrants have exposure to worldwide financial markets, including Europe. Disruptions in the European markets could reduce or restrict the Registrants\u2019 ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 29%, or $2.5 billion of the Registrants\u2019 available credit facilities were with European banks, excluding the unsecured bridge facility to provide financing for the proposed PHI acquisition. The credit facilities include $8.5 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $7.3 billion was available as of December 31, 2014. There were no borrowings under the Registrants\u2019 credit facilities as of December 31, 2014. See Note 13-Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the credit facilities.\nThe strength and depth of competition in energy markets depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading parties, which could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets and legislative and regulatory initiatives that may affect participants in commodities transactions. Reduced capital and liquidity and failures of significant institutions that participate in the energy markets could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy markets that are important to the respective businesses of the Registrants. Perceived weaknesses in the competitive strength of the energy markets could lead to pressures for greater regulation of those markets or attempts to replace market structures with other mechanisms for the sale of power, including the requirement of long-term contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nIf any of the Registrants were to experience a downgrade in its credit ratings to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards in its agreements with its trading counterparties, it would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral under its agreements with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing costs. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nGeneration\u2019s business is subject to credit quality standards that may require market participants to post collateral for their obligations. If Generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating) or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards of trading counterparties, it would be required under its hedging arrangements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity. The amount of collateral required to be provided by Generation at any point in time is dependent on a variety of factors, including (1) the notional amount of the applicable hedge, (2) the nature of counterparty and related agreements, and (3) changes in power or other commodity prices. In addition, if Generation were downgraded, it could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade. Generation could experience a downgrade in its ratings if any of the credit rating agencies concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the power generation industry in general, or Generation in particular, has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the credit rating agencies could also have a negative impact on the ratings of Generation.\nComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s operating agreements with PJM and PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s natural gas procurement contracts contain collateral provisions that are affected by their credit rating and market prices. If certain wholesale market conditions were to exist and ComEd, PECO and BGE were to lose their investment grade credit ratings (based on their senior unsecured debt ratings), they would be required to provide collateral in the forms of letters of credit or cash, which may have a material\nadverse effect upon their liquidity. Collateral posting requirements will generally increase as market prices rise and decrease as market prices fall. Collateral posting requirements for PECO and BGE, with respect to their natural gas supply contracts, will generally increase as forward market prices fall and decrease as forward market prices rise. Given the relationship to forward market prices, contract collateral requirements can be volatile. In addition, if ComEd, PECO and BGE were downgraded, they could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade.\nComEd, PECO or BGE could experience a downgrade in its ratings if any of the credit rating agencies concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the utility industry in general, or ComEd, PECO, or BGE in particular, has deteriorated. ComEd, PECO or BGE could experience a downgrade if the current regulatory environments in Illinois, Pennsylvania or Maryland, respectively, become less predictable by materially lowering returns for utilities in the applicable state or adopting other measures to mitigate higher electricity prices. Additionally, the ratings for ComEd, PECO or BGE could be downgraded if their financial results are weakened from current levels due to weaker operating performance or due to a failure to properly manage their capital structure. In addition, changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on the ratings of ComEd, PECO or BGE.\nComEd, PECO and BGE conduct their respective businesses and operate under governance models and other arrangements and procedures intended to assure that ComEd, PECO and BGE are treated as separate, independent companies, distinct from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in order to isolate ComEd, PECO and BGE from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in the event of financial difficulty at Exelon or another Exelon subsidiary. These measures (commonly referred to as \u201cring-fencing\u201d) may help avoid or limit a downgrade in the credit ratings of ComEd, PECO and BGE in the event of a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon. Despite these ring-fencing measures, the credit ratings of ComEd, PECO or BGE could remain linked, to some degree, to the credit ratings of Exelon. Consequently, a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon could result in a reduction of the credit rating of ComEd, PECO or BGE, or all three. A reduction in the credit rating of ComEd, PECO or BGE could have a material adverse effect on ComEd, PECO or BGE, respectively.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources-Recent Market Conditions and Security Ratings for further information regarding the potential impacts of credit downgrades on the Registrants\u2019 cash flows.\nGeneration\u2019s financial performance may be negatively affected by price volatility, availability and other risk factors associated with the procurement of nuclear and fossil fuel. (Exelon and Generation)\nGeneration depends on nuclear fuel and fossil fuels to operate its generating facilities. Nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services and contracted fuel fabrication services. Coal, natural gas and oil are procured for generating plants through annual, short-term and spot-market purchases. The supply markets for nuclear fuel, coal, natural gas and oil are subject to price fluctuations, availability restrictions and counterparty default that may negatively affect the results of operations and cash flows for Generation.\nGeneration\u2019s risk management policies cannot fully eliminate the risk associated with its commodity trading activities. (Exelon and Generation)\nGeneration\u2019s asset-based power position as well as its power marketing, fuel procurement and other commodity trading activities expose Generation to risks of commodity price movements. Generation attempts to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures. These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned\nand cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. Even when its policies and procedures are followed, and decisions are made based on projections and estimates of future performance, results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those decisions prove to be incorrect. Factors, such as future prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities, become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future estimates are made. As a result, Generation cannot predict the impact that its commodity trading activities and risk management decisions may have on its business, operating results, cash flows or financial position.\nGeneration buys and sells energy and other products and enters into financial contracts to manage risk and hedge various positions in Generation\u2019s power generation portfolio. The proportion of hedged positions in its power generation portfolio may cause volatility in Generation\u2019s future results of operations.\nFinancial performance and load requirements may be adversely affected if Generation is unable to effectively manage its power portfolio. (Exelon and Generation)\nA significant portion of Generation\u2019s power portfolio is used to provide power under procurement contracts with ComEd, PECO, BGE and other customers. To the extent portions of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose, Generation\u2019s output is sold in the wholesale power markets. To the extent its power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirements of its customers under the related agreements, Generation must purchase power in the wholesale power markets. Generation\u2019s financial results may be negatively affected if it is unable to cost-effectively meet the load requirements of its customers, manage its power portfolio and effectively address the changes in the wholesale power markets.\nChallenges to tax positions taken by the Registrants as well as tax law changes and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions, could negatively impact the Registrants\u2019 results of operations and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nCorporate Tax Reform. There exists the potential for comprehensive tax reform in the United States that may significantly change the tax rules applicable to U.S. domiciled corporations. Exelon cannot assess what the overall effect of such potential legislation might be on its results of operations and cash flows.\n1999 sale of fossil generating assets. The IRS has challenged Exelon\u2019s 1999 tax position on its like-kind exchange transaction. Exelon and the IRS failed to reach a settlement on the like-kind exchange position and Exelon filed a petition on December 31, 2013 to initiate litigation in the United States Tax Court. Exelon was not required to remit any part of the asserted tax or penalty in order to litigate the like-kind exchange position. The litigation could take three to five years including appeals, if necessary.\nAs of December 31, 2014, if the IRS is successful in its challenge to the like-kind exchange position, Exelon\u2019s potential cash outflow, including tax and after-tax interest, exclusive of penalties, that could become currently payable may be as much as $810 million, of which approximately $310 million would be attributable to ComEd after consideration of Exelon\u2019s agreement to hold ComEd harmless. In addition to attempting to impose tax on the like-kind exchange position, the IRS has asserted penalties for a substantial understatement of tax, which could result in an after-tax charge of $90 million to Exelon\u2019s and ComEd\u2019s results of operations should the IRS prevail in asserting the penalties. The timing effects of the final resolution of the like-kind exchange matter are unknown. See Note 14-Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTax reserves and the recoverability of deferred tax assets. The Registrants are required to make judgments in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals issues related to these tax matters. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that may be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. The Registrants also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards and tax credits. See Notes 1-Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14-Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIncreases in customer rates and the impact of economic downturns may lead to greater expense for uncollectible customer balances. Additionally, increased rates could lead to decreased volumes delivered. Both of these factors may decrease Generation\u2019s, ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s results from operations and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s current procurement plans include purchasing power through contracted suppliers and in the spot market. ComEd\u2019s and PECO\u2019s costs of purchased power are charged to customers without a return or profit component. BGE\u2019s SOS rates charged to customers recover BGE\u2019s wholesale power supply costs and include a return component. For PECO, purchased natural gas costs are charged to customers with no return or profit component. For BGE, purchased natural gas costs are charged to customers using a MBR mechanism that compares the actual cost of gas to a market index. The difference between the actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers. Purchased power and natural gas prices fluctuate based on their relevant supply and demand. Significantly higher rates related to purchased power and natural gas can result in declines in customer usage, lower revenues and potentially additional uncollectible accounts expense for ComEd, PECO and BGE. In addition, any challenges by the regulators or ComEd, PECO and BGE as to the recoverability of these costs could have a material effect on the Registrants\u2019 results of operations and cash flows. Also, ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when electricity and natural gas are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers.\nFurther, the impacts of economic downturns on ComEd, PECO and BGE customers and purchased natural gas costs for PECO and BGE customers, such as unemployment for residential customers and less demand for products and services provided by commercial and industrial customers, and the related regulatory limitations on residential service terminations, may result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balances, which would negatively impact ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s results from operations and cash flows. Generation\u2019s customer supply activities face economic downturn risks similar to Exelon\u2019s utility businesses, such as lower volumes sold and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances. As Generation increases its customer supply footprint, economic downturn impacts could negatively affect Generation\u2019s results from operations and cash flows. See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for further discussion of the Registrants\u2019 credit risk.\nThe effects of weather may impact the Registrants\u2019 results of operations and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nTemperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Moderate temperatures adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting revenues at ComEd and PECO. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE recognizes revenues at MDPSC-approved levels per customer, regardless of what\nactual distribution volumes are for a billing period, and is not affected by actual weather with the exception of major storms. Extreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms may stress ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s transmission and distribution systems, communication systems and technology, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each company\u2019s ability to meet peak customer demand. These extreme conditions may have detrimental effects on ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. First and third quarter financial results, in particular, are substantially dependent on weather conditions, and may make period comparisons less relevant.\nGeneration\u2019s operations are also affected by weather, which affects demand for electricity as well as operating conditions. To the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than assumed, Generation may require greater resources to meet its contractual commitments. Extreme weather conditions or storms may affect the availability of generation and its transmission, limiting Generation\u2019s ability to source or send power to where it is sold. In addition, drought-like conditions limiting water usage can impact Generation\u2019s ability to run certain generating assets at full capacity. These conditions, which cannot be accurately predicted, may have an adverse effect by causing Generation to seek additional capacity at a time when wholesale markets are tight or to seek to sell excess capacity at a time when markets are weak.\nCertain long-lived assets and other assets recorded on the Registrants\u2019 statements of financial position may become impaired, which would result in write-offs of the impaired amounts. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nLong-lived assets represent the single largest asset class on the Registrants\u2019 statement of financial position. Specifically, long-lived assets account for 60%, 51%, 62%, 68% and 77% of total assets for Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. In addition, Exelon and Generation have significant balances related to unamortized energy contracts. See Note 4-Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions and Note 10-Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Exelon\u2019s unamortized energy contracts. The Registrants evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or circumstances indicating a potential impairment exist. Factors such as the business climate, including current and future energy and market conditions, environmental regulation, and the condition of assets are considered when evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment. An impairment would require the Registrants to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset through a non-cash charge to expense by the amount of the impairment, and such an impairment could have a material adverse impact on the Registrants\u2019 results of operations.\nExelon holds investments in coal-fired plants in Georgia that are subject to long-term leases. The investments are accounted for as direct financing lease investments. The investments represent the estimated residual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term. On an annual basis, Exelon reviews the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments and records a non-cash impairment charge to expense if the review indicates an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the residual values below their carrying values. Such an impairment could have a material adverse impact on Exelon\u2019s results of operations.\nExelon and ComEd had approximately $2.7 billion of goodwill recorded at December 31, 2014 in connection with the merger between PECO and Unicom Corporation, the former parent company of ComEd. Under GAAP, goodwill remains at its recorded amount unless it is determined to be impaired, which is generally based upon an annual analysis that compares the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value. If an impairment occurs, the amount of the impaired goodwill will be written-off to expense, which will also reduce equity. The actual timing and amounts of any goodwill impairments will depend on many sensitive, interrelated and uncertain variables. A successful IRS challenge to\nExelon\u2019s and ComEd\u2019s like-kind exchange income tax position, adverse regulatory actions such as early termination of EIMA, or changes in significant assumptions used in estimating ComEd\u2019s fair value (e.g., discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, operating and capital expenditure requirements and the fair value of debt) could result in an impairment. Such an impairment would result in a non-cash charge to expense, which could have a material adverse impact on Exelon\u2019s and ComEd\u2019s results of operations.\nSee ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 7-Property, Plant and Equipment, Note 8-Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Note 10-Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on long-lived asset and goodwill impairments.\nThe Registrants\u2019 businesses are capital intensive, and their assets may require significant expenditures to maintain and are subject to operational failure, which could result in potential liability. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nThe Registrants\u2019 businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments by Generation in electric generating facilities and by ComEd, PECO and BGE in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects. These operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years. Older equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants\u2019 control, and may require significant expenditures to operate efficiently. The Registrants\u2019 results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows could be adversely affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital projects or raise the necessary capital. Furthermore, operational failure of electric or gas systems or infrastructure could result in potential liability if such failure results in damage to property or injury to individuals. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS for further information regarding the Registrants\u2019 potential future capital expenditures.\nExelon and its subsidiaries have guaranteed the performance of third parties, which may result in substantial costs in the event of non-performance by third parties. In addition, the Registrants have rights under agreements which obligate third parties to indemnify the Registrants for various obligations, and the Registrants may incur substantial costs in the event that the applicable Registrant is unable to enforce those agreements or the applicable third-party is otherwise unable to perform. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nThe Registrants have issued guarantees of the performance of third parties, which obligate one or more of the Registrants or their subsidiaries to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by those third parties, the Registrants could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees. Such performance guarantees could have a material impact on the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe Registrants have entered into various agreements with counterparties that require those counterparties to reimburse a Registrant and hold it harmless against specified obligations and claims. To the extent that any of these counterparties are affected by deterioration in their creditworthiness or the agreements are otherwise determined to be unenforceable, the affected Registrant could be held responsible for the obligations, which could impact that Registrant\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. In connection with Exelon\u2019s 2001 corporate restructuring, Generation assumed certain of ComEd\u2019s and PECO\u2019s rights and obligations with respect to their former generation businesses. Further, ComEd and PECO may have entered into agreements with third parties under which the third-party agreed to indemnify ComEd or PECO for certain obligations related to their respective former generation businesses that have been assumed by Generation as part of the\nrestructuring. If the third-party or Generation experienced events that reduced its creditworthiness or the indemnity arrangement became unenforceable, ComEd or PECO could be liable for any existing or future claims, which could impact ComEd\u2019s or PECO\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nGeneration\u2019s business may be negatively affected by competitive electric generation suppliers. (Exelon and Generation)\nBecause retail customers where Generation serves load can switch from their respective energy delivery company to a competitive electric generation supplier for their energy needs, planning to meet Generation\u2019s obligation to provide the supply needed to serve Generation\u2019s share of an electric distribution company\u2019s default service obligation is more difficult than planning for retail load before the advent of retail competition. Before retail competition, the primary variables affecting projections of load were weather and the economy. With retail competition, another major factor is retail customers switching to or from competitive electric generation suppliers. If fewer of such customers switch from its retail load serving counterparties than Generation anticipates, the load that Generation must serve will be greater than anticipated, which could, if market prices have increased, increase Generation\u2019s costs (due to its need to go to market to cover its incremental supply obligation) more than the increase in Generation\u2019s revenues. If more customers from its retail load serving counterparties switch than Generation anticipates, the load that Generation must serve will be lower than anticipated, which could, if market prices have decreased, cause Generation to lose opportunities in the market.\nRegulatory and Legislative Factors\nThe Registrants\u2019 generation and energy delivery businesses are highly regulated and could be subject to adverse regulatory and legislative actions. Fundamental changes in regulation or legislation or violation of tariffs or market rules and anti-manipulation laws, could disrupt the Registrants\u2019 business plans and adversely affect their operations and financial results. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nSubstantially all aspects of the businesses of the Registrants are subject to comprehensive Federal or state regulation and legislation. Further, Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s operating results and cash flows are heavily dependent upon the ability of Generation to sell power at market-based rates, as opposed to cost-based or other similarly regulated rates, and Exelon\u2019s, ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s operating results and cash flows are heavily dependent on the ability of ComEd, PECO and BGE to recover their costs for the retail purchase and distribution of power to their customers. Similarly, there is risk that financial market regulations could increase the Registrants\u2019 compliance costs and limit their ability to engage in certain transactions. In the planning and management of operations, the Registrants must address the effects of regulation on their businesses and changes in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by Federal and state legislatures, RTOs, exchanges, ratemaking agencies and taxing authorities. Additionally, the Registrants need to be cognizant of rules changes or Registrant actions that could result in potential violation of tariffs, market rules and anti-manipulation laws. Fundamental changes in regulations or other adverse legislative actions affecting the Registrants\u2019 businesses would require changes in their business planning models and operations and could adversely affect their results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nRegulatory and legislative developments related to climate change and RPS may also significantly affect Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial positions. Various legislative and regulatory proposals to address climate change through GHG emission reductions, if enacted, could result in increased costs to entities that generate electricity through carbon-emitting fossil fuels, which could increase the market price at which all generators in a region, including Generation, may sell their output, thereby increasing the revenue Generation could realize from its low-carbon nuclear assets. However, national regulation or legislation addressing climate change through\nan RPS could also increase the pace of development of wind energy facilities in the Midwest, which could put downward pressure on wholesale market prices for electricity from Generation\u2019s Midwest nuclear assets, partially offsetting any additional value Exelon and Generation might derive from Generation\u2019s nuclear assets under a carbon constrained regulatory regime that might exist in the future. Similarly, final regulations under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act may not provide sufficient incentives for states to utilize carbon-free nuclear power as a means of meeting greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements, while continuing a policy of favoring renewable energy sources. Current state level climate change and renewable regulation is already providing incentives for regional wind development. The Registrants cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what their effect will be on the Registrants.\nGeneration may be negatively affected by possible Federal or state legislative or regulatory actions that could affect the scope and functioning of the wholesale markets. (Exelon and Generation)\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are facing pressures to address consumer concerns, or are themselves raising concerns, that energy prices in wholesale markets are too high or insufficient generation is being built because the competitive model is not working, and, therefore, are considering some form of re-regulation or some other means of reducing wholesale market prices or subsidizing new generation. Generation is dependent on robust and competitive wholesale energy markets to achieve its business objectives.\nApproximately 60% of Generation\u2019s generating resources, which include directly owned assets and capacity obtained through long-term contracts, are located in the area encompassed by PJM. Generation\u2019s future results of operations will depend on (1) FERC\u2019s continued adherence to and support for, policies that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale power markets, such as PJM\u2019s, and (2) the absence of material changes to market structures that would limit or otherwise negatively affect market competitiveness. Generation could also be adversely affected by state laws, regulations or initiatives designed to reduce wholesale prices artificially below competitive levels or to subsidize new generation, such as the subsequently dismissed New Jersey Capacity Legislation and the MDPSC\u2019s RFP for new gas-fired generation in Maryland. See Note 3-Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the New Jersey Capacity Legislation and the Maryland new electric generation requirements.\nIn addition, FERC\u2019s application of its Order 697 and its subsequent revisions could pose a risk that Generation will have difficulty satisfying FERC\u2019s tests for market-based rates. Since Order 697 became final in June 2007, Generation has obtained orders affirming Generation\u2019s authority to sell at market-based rates and none denying that authority. As of December 31, 2014, Generation has submitted its triennial application seeking reauthorization to sell at market-based rates in the Southeast region. Generation\u2019s previous submission seeking reauthorization to sell at market-based rates was accepted by FERC on August 5, 2014 for the Northeast region (including PJM).\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was enacted in July 2010. The part of the Act that applies to Exelon is Title VII, which is known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act (Dodd-Frank). Dodd-Frank requires the creation of a new regulatory regime for over-the-counter swaps (Swaps), including mandatory clearing for certain categories of Swaps, incentives to shift Swap activity to exchange trading, margin and capital requirements, and other obligations designed to promote transparency. For non security-based Swaps including commodity Swaps, Dodd-Frank empowers the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to promulgate regulations implementing the law\u2019s objectives. The primary aim of Dodd-Frank is to regulate the key intermediaries in the Swaps market, which entities are either swap dealers (SDs), major swap participants (MSPs), and certain other financial entities, but the law also applies to a lesser\ndegree to end-users of Swaps. On January 12, 2015, President Obama signed into law a bill that exempts from margin requirements Swaps used by end-users to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. Moreover, the CFTC\u2019s Dodd-Frank regulations preserve the ability of end users in the energy industry to hedge their risks using Swaps without being subject to mandatory clearing, and excepts or exempts end-users from many of the other substantive regulations. Accordingly, as an end-user, Generation is conducting its commercial business in a manner that does not require registration with the CFTC as an SD or MSP. Generation does not anticipate transacting in the future in a manner in which it would become a SD or MSP.\nThere are, however, some rulemakings that have not yet been finalized, including the capital and margin rules for (non-cleared) Swaps. Generation does not expect these rules to directly impact its collateral requirements. However, depending on the substance of these final rules in addition to certain international regulatory requirements still under development and that are similar to Dodd-Frank, Generation\u2019s Swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant capitalization requirements. These regulations could motivate the SDs and MSPs to increase collateral requirements or cash postings from their counterparties, including Generation.\nGeneration continues to monitor the rulemaking proceedings with respect to the capital and margin rules, but cannot predict to what extent, if any, further refinements to Dodd-Frank requirements may impact its cash flows or financial position, but such impacts could be material.\nComEd, PECO and BGE could also be subject to some Dodd-Frank requirements to the extent they were to enter into Swaps. However, at this time, management of ComEd, PECO and BGE continue to expect that their companies will not be materially affected by Dodd-Frank.\nGeneration\u2019s affiliation with ComEd, PECO and BGE, together with the presence of a substantial percentage of Generation\u2019s physical asset base within the ComEd, PECO and BGE service territories, could increase Generation\u2019s cost of doing business to the extent future complaints or challenges regarding ComEd, PECO and/or BGE retail rates result in settlements or legislative or regulatory requirements funded in part by Generation. (Exelon and Generation)\nGeneration has significant generating resources within the service areas of ComEd, PECO and BGE and makes significant sales to each of them. Those facts tend to cause Generation to be directly affected by developments in those markets. Government officials, legislators and advocacy groups are aware of Generation\u2019s affiliation with ComEd, PECO and BGE and its sales to each of them. In periods of rising utility rates, particularly when driven by increased costs of energy production and supply, those officials and advocacy groups may question or challenge costs and transactions incurred by ComEd, PECO, or BGE, with Generation, irrespective of any previous regulatory processes or approvals underlying those transactions. The prospect of such challenges may increase the time, complexity and cost of the associated regulatory proceedings, and the occurrence of such challenges may subject Generation to a level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitors in those markets. In addition, government officials and legislators may seek ways to force Generation to contribute to efforts to mitigate potential or actual rate increases, through measures such as generation-based taxes and contributions to rate-relief packages.\nThe Registrants may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nThe businesses which the Registrants operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local, state and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Registrants conduct their operations and make capital expenditures including how they\nhandle air and water emissions and solid waste disposal. Violations of these emission and disposal requirements can subject the Registrants to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs for remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties and exposure to third parties\u2019 claims for alleged health or property damages or operating restrictions to achieve compliance. In addition, the Registrants are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by the Registrants and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Registrants have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance, site remediation and clean-up. Remediation activities associated with MGP operations conducted by predecessor companies are one component of such costs. Also, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future.\nIf application of Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, which establishes a national requirement for reducing the adverse impacts to aquatic organisms at existing generating stations, requires the retrofitting of cooling water intake structures at Salem or other Exelon power plants, this development could result in material costs of compliance. Pursuant to discussions with the NJDEP regarding the application of Section 316(b) to Oyster Creek, Generation agreed to permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019, ten years before the expiration of its operating license in 2029.\nAdditionally, Generation is subject to exposure for asbestos-related personal injury liability alleged at certain current and formerly owned generation facilities. Future legislative action could require Generation to make a material contribution to a fund to settle lawsuits for alleged asbestos-related disease and exposure.\nIn some cases, a third-party who has acquired assets from a Registrant has assumed the liability the Registrant may otherwise have for environmental matters related to the transferred property. If the transferee is unable, or fails, to discharge the assumed liability, a regulatory authority or injured person could attempt to hold the Registrant responsible, and the Registrant\u2019s remedies against the transferee may be limited by the financial resources of the transferee. See Note 22-Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nChanges in ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s respective terms and conditions of service, including their respective rates, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings and/or negotiated settlements that are at times contentious, lengthy and subject to appeal, which lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result and which may introduce time delays in effectuating rate changes. (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nComEd, PECO and BGE are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. The proceedings generally have timelines that may not be limited by statute. Decisions are subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings. The potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for ComEd, PECO or BGE to recover its costs by the time the rates become effective. Established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates can be adjusted, including recovery mechanisms for costs associated with the procurement of electricity or gas, bad debt, MGP remediation, smart grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency and demand response programs.\nIn certain instances, ComEd, PECO and BGE may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters, customer initiatives or franchise agreements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval.\nComEd, PECO and BGE cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland or Federal regulators in establishing rates, including the extent, if any, to which certain costs such as significant capital projects will be recovered or what rates of return will be allowed. Nevertheless, the expectation is that ComEd, PECO and BGE will continue to be obligated to deliver electricity to customers in their respective service territories and will also retain significant POLR and default service obligations to provide electricity and natural gas to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose an alternative supplier. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the ability of ComEd, PECO and BGE, as applicable, to recover their costs and could have a material adverse effect on ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. See Note 3-Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding rate proceedings.\nFederal or additional state RPS and/or energy conservation legislation, along with energy conservation by customers, could negatively affect the results of operations and cash flows of Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nChanges to current state legislation or the development of Federal legislation that requires the use of renewable and alternate fuel sources, such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal, could significantly impact Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed. The impact could include increased costs for RECs and purchased power and increased rates for customers.\nFederal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, such as smart meters and smart grid, have increased capital expenditures and could significantly impact ComEd, PECO and BGE, if timely cost recovery is not allowed. Furthermore, regulated energy consumption reduction targets and declines in customer energy consumption resulting from the implementation of new energy conservation technologies could lead to a decline in the revenues of Exelon, ComEd, and PECO. For additional information, see ITEM 1. BUSINESS \u201cEnvironmental Regulation-Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards.\u201d\nThe impact of not meeting the criteria of the FASB guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation could be material to Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE. (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nAs of December 31, 2014, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE have concluded that the operations of ComEd, PECO and BGE meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation. If it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of their businesses no longer meets the criteria, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE would be required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of their business. That action would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in their Consolidated Balance Sheets and the recognition of a one-time charge in their Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impact of not meeting the criteria of the authoritative guidance could be material to the financial statements of Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE. At December 31, 2014, the gain (loss) could have been as much as $(2.6) billion, $811 million and $480 million (before taxes) as a result of the elimination of ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively.\nFurther, Exelon would record a charge against OCI (before taxes) of up to $2.6 billion and $663 million for ComEd and BGE, respectively, related to Exelon\u2019s net regulatory assets associated with its defined benefit postretirement plans. Exelon also has a net regulatory liability of $53 million (before taxes) associated with PECO\u2019s defined benefit postretirement plans that would result in an increase in OCI if reversed. The impacts and resolution of the above items could lead to an additional impairment of ComEd\u2019s goodwill, which could be significant and at least partially offset the gain at ComEd discussed above. A significant decrease in equity as a result of any changes could limit the ability of ComEd, PECO and BGE to pay dividends under Federal and state law and no longer meeting the regulatory accounting criteria could cause significant volatility in future results of operations. See Notes 1-Significant Accounting Policies, 3-Regulatory Matters and 10-Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding accounting for the effects of regulation, regulatory matters and ComEd\u2019s goodwill, respectively.\nExelon and Generation may incur material costs of compliance if Federal and/or state regulation or legislation is adopted to address climate change. (Exelon and Generation)\nVarious stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as other companies in many business sectors, including utilities, are considering ways to address the effect of GHG emissions on climate change. In 2009, select Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states implemented a model rule, developed via the RGGI, to regulate CO2 emissions from fossil-fired generation. RGGI states are working on updated programs to further limit emissions and the EPA has introduced regulation to address greenhouse gases from new fossil plants that could potentially impact existing plants. If carbon reduction regulation or legislation becomes effective, Exelon and Generation may incur costs either to limit further the GHG emissions from their operations or to procure emission allowance credits. For example, more stringent permitting requirements may preclude the construction of lower-carbon nuclear and gas-fired power plants. Similarly, a Federal RPS could increase the cost of compliance by mandating the purchase or construction of more expensive supply alternatives. For more information regarding climate change, see ITEM 1. BUSINESS \u201cGlobal Climate Change\u201d and Note 22-Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Registrants could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards, including the likely exposure of ComEd, PECO, and BGE to the results of PJM\u2019s RTEP and NERC compliance requirements. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nAs a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, users, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system, including Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and enforced by FERC. As operators of natural gas distribution systems, PECO and BGE are also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with or changes in the reliability standards may subject the Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. In addition, the ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC impose certain distribution reliability standards on ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively. If the Registrants were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to remediation costs as well as sanctions, which could include substantial monetary penalties.\nComEd, PECO and BGE as transmission owners are subject to NERC compliance requirements. NERC provides guidance to transmission owners regarding assessments of transmission lines. The results of these assessments may require ComEd, PECO and BGE to incur incremental capital or\noperating and maintenance expenditures to ensure their transmission lines meet NERC standards. Uncertainties exist as to the construction of new transmission facilities, their cost and how those costs will be allocated to transmission system participants and customers. In accordance with a FERC order and related settlement, PJM\u2019s RTEP requires the costs of new transmission facilities to be allocated across the entire PJM footprint for new facilities greater than or equal to 500 kV, and requires costs of new facilities less than 500 kV to be allocated to the beneficiaries of the new facilities. Following a remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, FERC reaffirmed its decision related to allocation of new facilities 500 kV and above. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit remanded this decision a second time. On December 18, 2014, FERC issued an order setting an evidentiary hearing and settlement proceeding regarding the issue of the cost allocation for facilities 500 kV and above. This FERC order only applies to facilities included in the PJM RTEP prior to February 1, 2013. For facilities subsequently approved, the costs of new facilities that are double circuit 345 kV or greater than or equal to 500 kV will be allocated 50% across the entire PJM footprint and 50% allocated to identified beneficiaries. Costs for all other facilities will be allocated to all identified beneficiaries. This later decision is subject to rehearing by FERC and possible appeal.\nSee Note 3-Regulatory Matters and Note 22-Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Registrants cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to their business activities. An adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nThe Registrants are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of their business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 22-Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 results of operations.\nGeneration may be negatively affected by possible Nuclear Regulatory Commission actions that could affect the operations and profitability of its nuclear generating fleet. (Exelon and Generation)\nRegulatory risk. A change in the Atomic Energy Act or the applicable regulations or licenses may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and significantly affect Generation\u2019s results of operations or financial position. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by Generation, may cause the NRC to initiate such actions.\nAs an example, prior to the Fukushima Daiichi accident on March 11, 2011, the NRC had been evaluating seismic risk. After the Fukushima Daiichi accident, the NRC\u2019s focus on seismic risk intensified. As part of the NRC Near-Term Task Force (Task Force) review and evaluation of the Fukushima Daiichi accident, the Task Force recommended that plant operators conduct seismic reevaluations. In January 2012, the NRC released an updated seismic risk model that plant operators must use in performing the seismic reevaluations recommended by the Task Force. These reevaluations could result in the required implementation of additional mitigation strategies or modifications.\nSpent nuclear fuel storage. The approval of a national repository for the storage of SNF, such as the one previously considered at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and the timing of such facility opening, will\nsignificantly affect the costs associated with storage of SNF, and the ultimate amounts received from the DOE to reimburse Generation for these costs. The NRC\u2019s temporary storage rule (also referred to as the \u201cwaste confidence decision\u201d) recognizes that licensees can safely store spent nuclear fuel at nuclear power plants for up to 60 years beyond the original and renewed licensed operating life of the plants. In June 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit vacated the NRC\u2019s temporary storage rule on the grounds that the NRC should have conducted a more comprehensive environmental review to support the rule. On September 19, 2014, the NRC issued a revised rule codifying the NRC\u2019s generic determinations regarding the environmental impacts of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel beyond a reactor\u2019s licensed operating life. The Continued Storage Rule became effective on October 20, 2014.\nAny regulatory action relating to the timing and availability of a repository for SNF may adversely affect Generation\u2019s ability to decommission fully its nuclear units. Through May 15, 2014, in accordance with the NWPA and Generation\u2019s contract with the DOE, Generation paid the DOE a fee per kWh of net nuclear generation for the cost of SNF disposal. On November 19, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered the DOE to submit to Congress a proposal to reduce the current SNF disposal fee to zero, unless and until there is a viable disposal program. On January 3, 2014, the DOE filed a petition for rehearing which was denied by the D.C. Circuit Court on March 18, 2014. Also, on January 3, 2014, the DOE submitted a proposal to Congress to reduce the current SNF disposal fee to zero. On May 9, 2014, the DOE notified Generation that the SNF disposal fee was set to zero, effective May 16, 2014. Until such time as a new fee structure is in effect, Exelon and Generation will not accrue any further costs related to SNF disposal fees. Generation currently estimates 2025 to be the earliest date when the DOE will begin accepting SNF, which could be delayed by further regulatory action. See Note 22-Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the spent nuclear fuel obligation. Generation cannot predict what, if any, fee will be established in the future for SNF disposal. However, such a fee could be material to Generation\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nLicense renewals. Generation cannot assure that economics will support the continued operation of the facilities for all or any portion of any renewed license period. If the NRC does not renew the operating licenses for Generation\u2019s nuclear stations or a station cannot be operated through the end of its operating license, Generation\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by increased depreciation rates, impairment charges and accelerated future decommissioning costs, since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates currently include assumptions that license renewal will be received. In addition, Generation may lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments.\nOperational Factors\nThe Registrants\u2019 employees, contractors, customers and the general public may be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nEmployees and contractors throughout the organization work in, and customers and the general public may be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments near their operations. As a result, employees, contractors, customers and the general public are at risk for serious injury, including loss of life. Significant risks include nuclear accidents, dam failure, gas explosions, pole strikes and electric contact cases.\nNatural disasters, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemic and other significant events may adversely affect Exelon\u2019s results of operations, its ability to raise capital and its future growth. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nGeneration\u2019s fleet of power plants and ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s distribution and transmission infrastructures could be affected by natural disasters, such as seismic activity, more frequent and more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water availability, sea level rise and other related phenomena. Severe weather or other natural disasters could be destructive, which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs. An extreme weather event within the Registrants\u2019 service areas can also directly affect their capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment. An example of such an event was the February 5, 2014 ice storm, which interrupted electric service delivery to customers in PECO\u2019s service territory and resulted in significant restoration costs.\nAnother example of such an event includes the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami experienced by Japan on March 11, 2011, that seriously damaged the nuclear units at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, which are operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co. Natural disasters and other significant events increase the risk to Generation that the NRC or other regulatory or legislative bodies may change the laws or regulations governing, among other things, operations, maintenance, licensed lives, decommissioning, SNF storage, insurance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological aspects. In addition, natural disasters could affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for Generation\u2019s continued operation, particularly the cooling of generating units. Additionally, natural disasters and other events that have an adverse effect on the economy in general may adversely affect the Registrants\u2019 operations and their ability to raise capital.\nExelon does not know the impact that potential terrorist attacks could have on the industry in general and on Exelon in particular. As owner-operators of infrastructure facilities, such as nuclear, fossil and hydroelectric generation facilities and electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities, the Registrants face a risk that their operations would be direct targets or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign may affect their operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil. Furthermore, these catastrophic events could compromise the physical or cyber security of Exelon\u2019s facilities, which could adversely affect Exelon\u2019s ability to manage its business effectively. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors also may result in a decline in energy consumption, which may adversely affect the Registrants\u2019 results of operations and its ability to raise capital. In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs.\nThe Registrants would be significantly affected by the outbreak of a pandemic. Exelon has plans in place to respond to a pandemic. However, depending on the severity of a pandemic and the resulting impacts to workforce and other resource availability, the ability to operate its generating and transmission and distribution assets could be affected, resulting in decreased service levels and increased costs.\nIn addition, Exelon maintains a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property and casualty losses subject to unforeseen occurrences or catastrophic events that may damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be adequate to address such property and casualty losses.\nGeneration\u2019s financial performance may be negatively affected by matters arising from its ownership and operation of nuclear facilities. (Exelon and Generation)\nNuclear capacity factors. Capacity factors for generating units, particularly capacity factors for nuclear generating units, significantly affect Generation\u2019s results of operations. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs but produce electricity at low variable costs due to nuclear fuel costs typically being lower than fossil fuel costs. Consequently, to be successful, Generation must consistently operate its nuclear facilities at high capacity factors. Lower capacity factors increase Generation\u2019s operating costs by requiring Generation to produce additional energy from primarily its fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy Generation\u2019s obligations to committed third-party sales, including ComEd, PECO and BGE. These sources generally have higher costs than Generation incurs to produce energy from its nuclear stations.\nNuclear refueling outages. In general, refueling outages are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months. The total number of refueling outages, along with their duration, can have a significant impact on Generation\u2019s results of operations. When refueling outages at wholly and co-owned plants last longer than anticipated or Generation experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and Generation faces lower margins due to higher energy replacement costs and/or lower energy sales.\nNuclear fuel quality. The quality of nuclear fuel utilized by Generation can affect the efficiency and costs of Generation\u2019s operations. Certain of Generation\u2019s nuclear units have previously had a limited number of fuel performance issues. Remediation actions could result in increased costs due to accelerated fuel amortization, increased outage costs and/or increased costs due to decreased generation capabilities.\nOperational risk. Operations at any of Generation\u2019s nuclear generation plants could degrade to the point where Generation has to shut down the plant or operate at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. Generation may choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity. In either event, Generation may lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. In addition, Generation may not achieve the anticipated results under its series of planned power uprates across its nuclear fleet. For plants operated but not wholly owned by Generation, Generation may also incur liability to the co-owners. For plants not operated and not wholly owned by Generation, from which Generation receives a portion of the plants\u2019 output, Generation\u2019s results of operations are dependent on the operational performance of the operators and could be adversely affected by a significant event at those plants. Additionally, poor operating performance at nuclear plants not owned by Generation could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy, which could significantly affect Generation\u2019s results of operations or financial position. In addition, closure of generating plants owned by others, or extended interruptions of generating plants or failure of transmission lines, could affect transmission systems that could adversely affect the sale and delivery of electricity in markets served by Generation.\nNuclear major incident risk. Although the safety record of nuclear reactors generally has been very good, accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred both in the United States and abroad. The consequences of a major incident can be severe and include loss of life and property damage. Any resulting liability from a nuclear plant major incident within the United States, owned or operated by Generation or owned by others, may exceed Generation\u2019s resources, including insurance coverage. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from insurers or the nuclear industry, could be borne by Generation and could have a material adverse effect on Generation\u2019s results of operations or financial position. Additionally, an accident or other significant\nevent at a nuclear plant within the United States or abroad, owned by others or Generation, may result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy and significantly affect Generation\u2019s results of operations or financial position.\nNuclear insurance. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, Generation carries the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance. The required amount of nuclear liability insurance is $375 million for each operating site. Claims exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in a financial protection pool. In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims exceeding the $13.6 billion limit for a single incident.\nGeneration is a member of an industry mutual insurance company, NEIL, which provides property and business interruption insurance for Generation\u2019s nuclear operations. In previous years, NEIL has made distributions to its members but Generation cannot predict the level of future distributions or if they will occur at all. See Note 22-Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of nuclear insurance.\nDecommissioning. NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in certain minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. Generation is required to provide to the NRC a biennial report by unit (annually for Generation\u2019s two units that have been retired) addressing Generation\u2019s ability to meet the NRC-estimated funding levels including scheduled contributions to and earnings on the decommissioning trust funds. The NRC funding levels are based upon the assumption that decommissioning will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit.\nForecasting trust fund investment earnings and costs to decommission nuclear generating stations requires significant judgment, and actual results may differ significantly from current estimates. The performance of capital markets also can significantly affect the value of the trust funds. Currently, Generation is making contributions to certain trust funds of the former PECO units based on amounts being collected by PECO from its customers and remitted to Generation. While Generation, through PECO, has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers (subject to certain limitations and thresholds), it has no recourse to collect additional amounts from utility customers for any of its other nuclear units if there is a shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning. If circumstances changed such that Generation would be unable to continue to make contributions to the trust funds of the former PECO units based on amounts collected from PECO customers, or if Generation no longer had recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers if there was a shortfall of funds for decommissioning, the adequacy of the trust funds related to the former PECO units may be negatively affected and Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s results of operations and financial position could be significantly affected. See Note 3-Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUltimately, if the investments held by Generation\u2019s NDTs are not sufficient to fund the decommissioning of Generation\u2019s nuclear units, Generation may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that current and future NRC minimum funding requirements are met. As a result, Generation\u2019s cash flows and financial position may be significantly adversely affected. Additionally, if the pledged assets are not sufficient to fund the Zion station decommissioning activities under the Asset Sale Agreement (ASA), Generation may have to seek remedies available under the ASA to reduce the risk of default by ZionSolutions and its parent. See Note 15-Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGeneration\u2019s financial performance may be negatively affected by risks arising from its ownership and operation of hydroelectric facilities. (Exelon and Generation)\nFERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways, Federal lands or connected to the interstate electric grid. The license for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project expires August 31, 2015, and the license for the Muddy Run Pumped Storage Project expires on September 1, 2015. Generation cannot predict whether it will receive all the regulatory approvals for the renewed licenses of its hydroelectric facilities. If FERC does not issue new operating licenses for Generation\u2019s hydroelectric facilities or a station cannot be operated through the end of its operating license, Generation\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by increased depreciation rates and accelerated future decommissioning costs, since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates currently include assumptions that license renewal will be received. Generation may also lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. In addition, conditions may be imposed as part of the license renewal process that may adversely affect operations, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating costs and significantly affect Generation\u2019s results of operations or financial position. Similar effects may result from a change in the Federal Power Act or the applicable regulations due to events at hydroelectric facilities owned by others, as well as those owned by Generation.\nComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s operating costs, and customers\u2019 and regulators\u2019 opinions of ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively, are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational systems. (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nFailures of the equipment or facilities, including information systems, used in ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s delivery systems can interrupt the electric transmission and electric and natural gas delivery, which could negatively impact related revenues, and increase maintenance and capital expenditures. Equipment or facilities failures can be due to a number of factors, including weather or information systems failure. Specifically, if the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure, smart grid or other technologies in ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s or BGE\u2019s service territory fail to perform as intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information systems, ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if any of the financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s or BGE\u2019s financial results could be adversely affected. If an employee causes the operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating the operational systems, ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s or BGE\u2019s financial results could also be adversely affected. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nThe aforementioned failures or those of other utilities, including prolonged or repeated failures, can affect customer satisfaction and the level of regulatory oversight and ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s maintenance and capital expenditures. Regulated utilities, which are required to provide service to all customers within their service territory, have generally been afforded liability protections against claims by customers relating to failure of service. Under Illinois law, however, ComEd can be required to pay damages to its customers in some circumstances involving extended outages affecting large numbers of its customers, and those damages could be material to ComEd\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. See Note 22-Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding proceedings related to storm-related outages in ComEd\u2019s service territory.\nComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s respective ability to deliver electricity, their operating costs and their capital expenditures may be negatively affected by transmission congestion. (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nDemand for electricity within ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage with consequent effects on operating costs, revenues and results of operations. Also, insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s ability to comply with reliability standards and strain customer and regulatory agency relationships. As with all utilities, potential concerns over transmission capacity or generation facility retirements could result in PJM or FERC requiring ComEd, PECO and BGE to upgrade or expand their respective transmission systems through additional capital expenditures.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce may negatively impact the Registrants\u2019 results of operations. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nCertain events, such as an employee strike, loss of contract resources due to a major event, and an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, may lead to operating challenges and increased costs for the Registrants. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may arise. The Registrants are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees for their generation, transmission and distribution operations. If the Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations could be negatively affected.\nThe Registrants are subject to physical and information security risks. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nThe Registrants face physical and information security risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and distribution facilities. A security breach of the physical assets or information systems of the Registrants, their competitors, RTOs and ISOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject the Registrants to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer data. If a significant breach occurred, the reputation of Exelon and its customer supply activities may be adversely affected, customer confidence in the Registrants or others in the industry may be diminished, or Exelon and its subsidiaries may be subject to legal claims, any of which may contribute to the loss of customers and have a negative impact on the business and/or results of operations. ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s and BGE\u2019s deployment of smart meters throughout their service territories may increase the risk of damage from an intentional disruption of the system by third parties. As with most companies in today\u2019s environment, Exelon experiences attempts by hackers to infiltrate its corporate network. To date there have been no infiltrations that have resulted in loss of data or any significant effects on business operations. Exelon utilizes a dedicated team of cyber security professionals to ensure the protection of its information and ability to conduct business operations. Despite the measures taken by the Registrants to prevent a security breach, the Registrants cannot accurately assess the probability that a security breach may occur and are unable to quantify the potential impact of such an event. In addition, new or updated security regulations could require changes in current measures taken by the Registrants or their business operations and could adversely affect their results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe Registrants may make investments in new business initiatives, including initiatives mandated by regulators, and markets that may not be successful, and acquisitions may not achieve the intended financial results. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)\nGeneration continues to pursue growth in its existing businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain. Generation is pursuing investment opportunities in renewables, development of natural gas generation, distributed generation, potential expansion of the existing natural gas and oil Upstream and wholesale gas businesses, and entry into liquefied natural gas. Such initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering a market. As these markets mature, there may be new market entrants or expansion by established competitors that increase competition for customers and resources. Additionally, it is possible that FERC, state public utility commissions or others may impose certain other restrictions on such transactions. All of these factors could result in higher costs or lower revenues than expected, resulting in lower than planned returns on investment.\nComEd, PECO and BGE face risks associated with their regulatory-mandated Smart Grid initiatives. These risks include, but are not limited to, cost recovery, regulatory concerns, cyber security and obsolescence of technology. Due to these risks, no assurance can be given that such initiatives will be successful and will not have a material adverse effect on ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s or BGE\u2019s financial results.\nRisks Related to the Pending Merger with PHI\nExelon and PHI may encounter difficulties in satisfying the conditions for the completion of the Merger and the Merger may not be completed within the expected time frame or at all.\nConsummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions, including (1) the approval of the Merger by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the PHI common stock, (2) the receipt of regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger, (3) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and (4) other customary closing conditions, including (a) the accuracy of each party\u2019s representations and warranties (subject to customary materiality qualifiers) and (b) each party\u2019s compliance with its obligations and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the obligation of Exelon to consummate the Merger is subject to the required regulatory approvals not, individually or in the aggregate, imposing terms, conditions, obligations or commitments that constitute a burdensome condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement).\nIn addition, conditions to the completion of the Merger may fail to be satisfied. Exelon or PHI may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not completed by July 29, 2015 except that, under certain circumstances, the date may be extended by Exelon or PHI to October 29, 2015. See Note 4-Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the status of the merger.\nThe Merger is subject to the receipt of consent or approval from governmental entities that could delay the completion of the Merger or impose conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the combined company or that could cause abandonment of the Merger.\nCompletion of the Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of consents, orders, approvals or clearances, to the extent required, from the FERC, the FCC, the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, and the public utility commissions or similar entities in certain states in which the companies operate, including the Delaware Public Service Commission, MDPSC, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and the Virginia Department of Public Utilities. The Merger is also subject to\nreview by the DOJ Antitrust Division, under the HSR Act, and the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period (and any extension of the waiting period) applicable to the Merger is a condition to closing the Merger. See Note 4-Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the status of regulatory approvals.\nExelon and PHI have proposed conditions for approval in some of the regulatory filings that have been made and may subsequently propose or agree to further conditions, even if such conditions could have an adverse effect on Exelon, PHI or the combined company.\nExelon cannot provide assurance that all required regulatory consents or approvals will be obtained or that these consents or approvals will not contain terms, conditions or restrictions that would be detrimental to the combined company after the completion of the Merger. The Merger Agreement generally permits Exelon to terminate the Merger Agreement if the final terms of any of the required regulatory consents or approvals include burdensome conditions (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Any substantial delay in obtaining satisfactory approvals or the imposition of any terms or conditions in connection with such approvals could cause a material reduction in the expected benefits of the Merger.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval may result in Exelon\u2019s payment of a reverse termination fee.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances due to the failure to obtain regulatory approvals, the failure to obtain regulatory approvals without burdensome conditions, or the breach by Exelon of its obligations in respect of obtaining regulatory approvals, Exelon will be required to pay PHI a reverse termination fee of up to $180 million, which would occur by means of PHI\u2019s election to redeem the outstanding nonvoting preferred securities purchased by Exelon in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement for no consideration other than the nominal par value of the stock.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively affect the share price and the future business and financial results of Exelon.\nCompletion of the Merger is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that approval of the transaction by governmental agencies will not be obtained or that certain other closing conditions will not be satisfied. If the Merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of Exelon may be adversely affected and Exelon will be subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nhaving to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger without receiving the benefits of the Merger, including, in certain circumstances, a termination fee of up to $180 million payable by Exelon to PHI under certain circumstances; and\n\u2022\nthe share price of Exelon may decline if and to the extent that the current market prices reflect an assumption by the market that the Merger will be completed.\nExelon and PHI have incurred and will incur significant transaction and Merger-related costs in connection with the Merger.\nExelon and PHI have incurred and expect to incur additional non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies. Most of these costs will be transaction costs, including fees paid to financial and legal advisors related to the Merger and related financing arrangements, and employment-related costs, including change-in- control related payments made to certain PHI executives. In addition, if the closing of the Merger is materially delayed, Exelon may be required to pay financing costs without having realized any benefits from the Merger during the period of delay.\nExelon will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. Although Exelon expects that the elimination of costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, will exceed incremental transaction and Merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nExelon may not realize the expected benefits of the Merger because of integration difficulties and other challenges.\nThe success of the PHI acquisition will depend, in part, on Exelon\u2019s ability to realize all or some of the anticipated benefits from integrating PHI\u2019s business with Exelon\u2019s existing businesses. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The challenges associated with integrating the operations of PHI\u2019s business include, among others:\n\u2022\ndelay in implementation of our business plan for the combined business;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues or costs in integrating financial, information technology, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\npossible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, and compensation structures between PHI\u2019 s structure and our structure;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retention of key employees;\n\u2022\noperating risks inherent in PHI\u2019s business and our business; and\n\u2022\nunexpected regulatory requirements.\nExelon and PHI will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that may adversely affect their ability to attract and retain key employees, and potentially affect the company\u2019s financial results.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on Exelon and/or PHI. These uncertainties may impair Exelon\u2019s and/or PHI\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. In addition, current and prospective Exelon and PHI employees may determine that they do not desire to work for the combined company for a variety of possible reasons.\nThe Merger may divert attention of management at Exelon and PHI, which could detract from efforts to meet business goals.\nThe pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration may place a burden on management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect Exelon\u2019s and/or PHI\u2019s financial results. The process of integrating the operations of PHI may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. Exelon\u2019s future operations and cash flows will depend to a significant degree upon Exelon\u2019s ability to operate PHI efficiently, achieve the strategic operating objectives for the business and realize cost savings and synergies. Exelon\u2019s management team may encounter unforeseen difficulties in managing the integration. In order to successfully integrate PHI, Exelon\u2019s management team will need to focus on realizing anticipated synergies and cost savings on a timely basis while maintaining the efficiency of operations. Any substantial diversion of management attention could affect Exelon\u2019s ability to achieve operational, financial and strategic objectives.\nWe are obligated to complete the Merger whether or not we have obtained the required financing.\nExelon intends to fund the cash consideration in the Merger using a combination of approximately $3.5 billion of debt, up to $1.0 billion in cash from asset sales, and the remainder through issuance of equity (including mandatory convertible securities). See Note 4-Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions and Note 13-Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the merger financing.\nThe combined company\u2019s assets, liabilities or results of operations could be adversely affected by unknown or unexpected events, conditions or actions that might occur at PHI prior to the closing of the Merger.\nThe PHI assets, liabilities, business, financial condition, cash flows, operating results and prospects to be acquired or assumed by Exelon by reason of the merger could be adversely affected before or after the Merger closing as a result of previously unknown events or conditions occurring or existing before the Merger closing. Adverse changes in PHI\u2019s business or operations could occur or arise as a result of actions by PHI, legal or regulatory developments including the emergence or unfavorable resolution of pre-acquisition loss contingencies, deteriorating general business, market, industry or economic conditions, and other factors both within and beyond the control of PHI. A significant decline in the value of PHI assets to be acquired by Exelon or a significant increase in PHI liabilities to be assumed by Exelon could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s future business, financial condition, cash flows, operating results and prospects.\nExelon may record goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect its operating results.\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of PHI common stock by Exelon and will follow the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The assets and liabilities of PHI will be consolidated with those of Exelon. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of PHI\u2019s assets and liabilities, if any, will be recorded as goodwill.\nThe amount of goodwill, which could be material, will be allocated to the appropriate reporting units of the combined company. Exelon is required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units. To the extent the carrying value of any of those reporting units is greater than the fair value, a second step comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount would be required to determine if the goodwill is impaired. Such a potential impairment could result in a material non-cash charge that would have a material impact on Exelon\u2019s future operating results and consolidated balance sheet.\nLegal proceedings in connection with the Merger, the outcomes of which are uncertain, could delay or prevent the completion of the Merger.\nOne of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that no judgment (whether preliminary, temporary or permanent) or other order by any court or other governmental entity shall be in effect that restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger.\nPHI and its directors have been named as defendants in purported class action lawsuits filed on behalf of named plaintiffs and other public stockholders challenging the proposed Merger and seeking, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from consummating the Merger on the agreed-upon terms. Exelon has been named as a defendant in these lawsuits. Exelon has also been named in a federal court case with similar claims. In September 2014, the parties reached a proposed settlement which is subject to court approval. Final court approval of the proposed settlement is not expected to occur until the second quarter of 2015, at the earliest.\nIf a plaintiff in these or any other litigation claims that may be filed in the future is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the Merger on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the injunction may prevent the completion of the Merger in the expected time frame or altogether. If completion of the Merger is prevented or delayed, it could result in substantial costs to Exelon. In addition, Exelon could incur significant costs in connection with the lawsuits, including costs associated with the indemnification of PHI\u2019s directors and officers.\nPrivate parties who may believe they are adversely affected by the Merger and individual states may bring legal actions under the antitrust laws in certain circumstances or intervene in regulatory proceedings. Although Exelon and PHI believe the completion of the Merger will not conflict with any antitrust law, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if a challenge is made, what the result will be. Under the Merger Agreement, Exelon and PHI have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory clearances necessary to complete the Merger as promptly as practicable. In addition, in order to complete the Merger, Exelon and PHI may be required to comply with conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions imposed by regulatory agencies and any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions may have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting Exelon\u2019s revenues after the completion of the Merger, or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits from the Merger. In addition, any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions could result in the delay or abandonment of the Merger.\nThe Merger may be completed on terms different from those contained in the Merger Agreement.\nPrior to the completion of the Merger, Exelon and PHI may, by their mutual agreement, amend or alter the terms of the Merger Agreement, including with respect to, among other things, the Merger consideration to be received by PHI stockholders or any covenants or agreements with respect to the parties\u2019 respective operations pending completion of the Merger. In addition, Exelon may choose to waive requirements of the Merger Agreement, including some conditions to closing of the Merger. Any such amendments, alterations or waivers may have negative consequences to Exelon.\nRisks Related to the Merger with Constellation\nExelon may encounter unexpected difficulties or costs in meeting commitments it made under various orders and agreements associated with regulatory approvals for the Constellation merger.\nAs a result of the process to obtain regulatory approvals required for the Constellation merger, Exelon is committed to various programs, contributions, investments and market mitigation measures in several settlement agreements and regulatory approval orders. It is possible that Exelon may encounter delays, unexpected difficulties or costs in meeting these commitments in compliance with the terms of the relevant agreements and orders. Failure to fulfill the commitments in accordance with their terms could result in increased costs or result in penalties or fines that could adversely affect Exelon\u2019s financial position and operating results.", "PERMNO": 21776, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "EXC"}
