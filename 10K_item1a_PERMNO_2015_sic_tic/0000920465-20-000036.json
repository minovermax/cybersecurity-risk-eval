Risk Factors\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business. We have attempted to identify below the major factors that could cause differences between actual and planned or expected results, but we cannot assure you that we have identified all of those factors. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties. In such case, the trading price of shares of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe are substantially dependent on the commercial success of GIAPREZATM (angiotensin II).\nThe success of our business is substantially dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize GIAPREZATM (angiotensin II), our only commercial product. Although employees in our Company have prior experience launching pharmaceutical products at prior companies, GIAPREZA is the first product we have launched. Furthermore, the market for effective pharmaceutical sales and marketing professionals is competitive, and maintaining these capabilities is expensive and challenging. If we are unable to maintain an effective sales and marketing organization, GIAPREZA sales could be adversely affected, and our business could suffer.\nIn the U.S. and most major foreign markets, drugs like GIAPREZA that are administered in the hospital must be purchased by the hospital and generally are not reimbursed by third-party payors. Hospitals instead are reimbursed for patient cases based on patients\u2019 diagnosed conditions under the U.S. Medicare diagnosis-related group (\u201cDRG\u201d) system or other like systems for non-Medicare patients in the U.S. and in most major foreign markets. Adoption of new drugs that are administered in the hospital generally occurs more slowly than adoption of new drugs that are taken on an outpatient basis, which generally are paid for by third-party payors. If we are\nunsuccessful at convincing hospitals and health care providers to increase their rate of adoption of GIAPREZA, our business will suffer.\nCatecholamines (primarily norepinephrine), which are available as generics and inexpensive, are typically used in the first line to treat distributive shock, while Vasostrict\u00ae (Endo International plc) is typically used in the second line. In the randomized, Phase 3 study ATHOS-3, GIAPREZA demonstrated clinical benefit in patients who were not adequately responding to available vasopressors, including catecholamines and Vasostrict. GIAPREZA\u2019s principle competition as a treatment in patients not adequately responding to available vasopressors is the use of these same vasopressors, particularly norepinephrine, at increased doses. If we are unable to successfully change treatment practices, the commercial prospects for GIAPREZA will be limited, and our business will suffer.\nOur estimate of the potential market size for GIAPREZA is based on prescription and sales data for relevant in-market products, the results of clinical studies, medical literature and other information. If the potential market size for GIAPREZA is smaller than our estimate, the commercial prospects for GIAPREZA may be limited, and our business may suffer.\nThe commercial success of GIAPREZA will depend on our ability to obtain an uninterrupted supply of GIAPREZA from our contract manufacturers.\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of GIAPREZA or LJPC-0118 (I.V. artesunate). We rely on sole-source third-party manufacturers to produce GIAPREZA and LJPC-0118 and expect to continue to do so to meet our development and commercial needs. In all of our manufacturing agreements, we require that third-party contract manufacturers produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPIs\u201d) and drug products in accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (\u201cFDA\u2019s\u201d) current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMPs\u201d) and all other applicable laws and regulations. The long-term commercial success of GIAPREZA will depend in part on the ability of our contract manufacturers to supply cGMP-compliant API and drug product without interruption. If there is an interruption in the supply of GIAPREZA from our contract manufacturers, our business will suffer.\nGIAPREZA\u2019s market exclusivity period will depend on the validity and enforceability of issued and pending patents covering GIAPREZA.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned or had in-licensed 10 issued U.S. patents, 12 pending U.S. patent applications, 3 issued foreign patents and 45 pending foreign patent applications that cover GIAPREZA. The U.S. patents and patent applications expire between 2029 and 2040, and the foreign patents and patent applications expire between 2034 and 2040. Although we believe the bases for these patents and patent applications are sound, they are untested, and there is no assurance that they will not be successfully challenged. There can be no assurance that any patent previously issued will protect GIAPREZA from generic competition or that any patent application will result in an issued patent that will protect GIAPREZA from generic competition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that GIAPREZA will not be held to infringe valid patents held by others. If our owned and in-licensed intellectual property do not protect GIAPREZA from generic competition, GIAPREZA sales will decline, and our business will suffer. If GIAPREZA is held to infringe valid patents held by others, we could be subject to liability, and our business could suffer.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and reduce GIAPREZA sales.\nPatients suffering from distributive shock are gravely ill and have a high mortality rate. Although 28-day mortality in patients treated with GIAPREZA was lower than in patients treated with placebo in the randomized, Phase 3 study ATHOS-3, there was a higher incidence of arterial and venous thrombotic and thromboembolic events in patients treated with GIAPREZA in this study. Some patients who are treated with GIAPREZA will die due to their underlying illness or suffer adverse events (which may or may not be drug related). As such, we may face product liability lawsuits. Although we carry product liability insurance, product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and reduce GIAPREZA sales. Furthermore, any such lawsuits could impair our business reputation and result in the initiation of investigations by regulators.\nOur ability to continue commercializing GIAPREZA is dependent on our fulfillment of contractual obligations to certain parties.\nIn May 2018, we closed a $125.0 million royalty financing agreement (the \u201cRoyalty Agreement\u201d) with HealthCare Royalty Partners (\u201cHCR\u201d). Under the terms of the Royalty Agreement, we received $125.0 million in exchange for tiered royalty payments on worldwide net sales of GIAPREZA. HCR is entitled to receive quarterly royalties on worldwide net sales of GIAPREZA beginning April 1, 2018. Quarterly payments to HCR under the Royalty Agreement start at a maximum royalty rate, with step-downs based on the achievement of annual net product sales thresholds. Through December 31, 2021, the royalty rate will be a maximum of 10%. Starting January 1, 2022, the maximum royalty rate may increase by 4% if an agreed-upon, cumulative net product sales threshold has not been met, and, starting January 1, 2024, the maximum royalty rate may increase by an additional 4% if a different agreed-upon, cumulative net product sales threshold has not been met. The Royalty Agreement is subject to maximum aggregate royalty payments to HCR of $225.0 million. The Royalty Agreement expires upon the first to occur of January 1, 2031 or when the maximum aggregate royalty payments have been made. The Royalty Agreement was entered into by our wholly-owned subsidiary, La Jolla Pharma, LLC, and HCR has no recourse under the Royalty Agreement against La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company or any assets other than GIAPREZA. However, under the terms of the Royalty Agreement, La Jolla Pharma, LLC has certain obligations, including the obligation to use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to commercialize GIAPREZA. If La Jolla Pharma, LLC is held to not have met these obligations, HCR would have the right to terminate the Royalty Agreement and demand payment from La Jolla Pharma, LLC of either $125.0 million or $225.0 million (depending on which obligation La Jolla Pharma, LLC is held to not have met), minus aggregate royalties already paid to HCR. In the event that La Jolla Pharma, LLC fails to timely pay such amount if and when due, HCR would have the right to foreclose on the GIAPREZA-related assets.\nIn December 2014, we entered into a patent license agreement with George Washington University (\u201cGW\u201d), which was amended and restated on March 1, 2016 (the \u201cGW License\u201d) and subsequently assigned to La Jolla Pharma, LLC. Pursuant to the GW License, GW exclusively licensed to us certain intellectual property rights relating to GIAPREZA, including the exclusive rights to certain issued patents and patent applications covering GIAPREZA. Under the GW License, La Jolla Pharma, LLC is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, commercialize, market and sell GIAPREZA and make certain payments to GW, including a 6% royalty on net sales of GIAPREZA. If La Jolla Pharma, LLC is held to not have met its obligations, GW could terminate the GW License and La Jolla Pharma, LLC would no longer have rights to the GW issued patents and patent applications covering GIAPREZA.\nOur ability to obtain FDA approval of LJPC-0118 is uncertain.\nLa Jolla filed a New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) with the FDA for LJPC-0118 for the treatment of severe malaria in the second half of 2019. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve LJPC-0118 in a timely manner, or at all.\nOur ability to receive a tropical disease Priority Review Voucher is uncertain.\nLa Jolla may be eligible to receive a tropical disease Priority Review Voucher (\u201cPRV\u201d) for LJPC-0118, as malaria is defined as a disease qualifying for a tropical disease PRV under Section 524 of the FDCA. The FDA is authorized to award a tropical disease PRV to sponsors of applications for certain products for the prevention or treatment of certain tropical diseases. A tropical disease PRV may be used by the sponsor that obtains the tropical disease PRV or may be transferred to another sponsor that may use it to obtain Priority Review for a different application. In order to be eligible for a tropical disease PRV, the application must: (i) be for a tropical disease as defined in Section 524 of the FDCA; (ii) be submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA or Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (\u201cPHSA\u201d); (iii) be for a product that contains no active ingredient that has been approved in any other application submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA or Section 351 of the PHSA; and (iv) qualify for Priority Review. Even if LJPC-0118 is approved by the FDA, there can be no assurance that we will receive a tropical disease PRV. Furthermore, even if we receive a tropical disease PRV, there can be no assurance that it will be of any value to us.\nOur ability to hire and retain key employees is uncertain.\nAs of February 24, 2020, we employed 91 employees. The market for effective professionals in the pharmaceutical industry is competitive, and hiring and retaining these professionals are expensive and challenging.\nIf we are unable to hire and retain key employees, we may be unable to effectively execute on our operating plan, and our business could suffer.\nBusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, natural disasters, public health crises or other catastrophic events could have an adverse impact on our business.\nBusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, such as war and terrorism, natural disasters, public health crises, such as a pandemic, or other catastrophic events could have an adverse impact on our business. For example, if one of these events were to adversely affect one of our contract manufacturers, our supply of GIAPREZA could be interrupted. Furthermore, in the case of a pandemic, the ability of our critical care specialists to access hospitals and call on physicians may be curtailed, which may adversely affect product sales.\nOur overall financial performance, including but not limited to net product sales and net cash used in operating activities, may not meet our expectations.\nOur overall financial performance, including but not limited to net product sales and net cash used in operating activities, is difficult to predict and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. Historical financial performance may not be indicative of future financial performance. For example, our net product sales may be below expectations, and our costs to operate our business, including cost of product sales, research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, could exceed our estimates. If our overall financial performance does not meet our expectations, our business could suffer.\nOur capital requirements and our potential need for, and ability to obtain, additional financing are uncertain.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash of $87.8 million. GIAPREZA is our only approved product and our only source of product revenue. To reach the point at which we are able to generate positive cash flow from operations, we may need to raise additional capital. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, if any, will depend on many factors, including the success of our commercialization efforts for GIAPREZA, our ability to receive a tropical disease PRV and our ability to control expenses. If necessary, we will raise additional capital through equity or debt financings or collaboration agreements. We can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we need to raise additional capital and are unable to do so, we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the health care industry that could result in substantial penalties for noncompliance.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the health care industry that could result in substantial penalties for noncompliance. These laws and regulations may impact our ability to operate, including our sales and marketing efforts. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by federal, state and foreign governments that govern jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal health care program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example gifts, cash payments, donations, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing any item, service or compensation for something other than fair market value.\n\u2022\nFederal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we may not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws in a variety of ways. These include: providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers; improperly promoting a product\u2019s off-label use; violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; or misreporting pricing information to government programs.\n\u2022\nProvisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.\n\u2022\nThe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d), which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and report to U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer.\n\u2022\nVarious federal, state and foreign data privacy and security laws and regulations. These include provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations (\u201cHITECH\u201d), which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information in the U.S. and the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the European Union that became effective in May 2018. We may not be directly subject to certain of these laws and regulations, such as privacy and security requirements under HIPAA; however, we may be subject to criminal penalties for knowingly, aiding and embedding these violations.\n\u2022\nSection 1927 of the Social Security Act, which requires that manufacturers of drugs and biological products covered by Medicaid report pricing information to CMS on a monthly and quarterly basis, including the best price available to any customer of the manufacturer, with certain exceptions for government programs, and pay prescription rebates to state Medicaid programs based on a statutory formula derived from reported pricing information.\n\u2022\nState and/or foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as the recently effective California Consumer Privacy Act, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, which complicates our compliance efforts.\nIf we are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other laws or regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to substantial penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. If we are subjected to substantial penalties, our business will suffer, and we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations.\nDrug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome.\nDrug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. Failure can occur at any time during drug development. The results of nonclinical studies and early clinical studies may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical studies. For example, the safety or efficacy results of clinical studies do not ensure that later clinical studies will demonstrate similar results. Even if clinical studies demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate, there is no assurance that such product candidate will receive regulatory approval.\nDrugs approved by the FDA are subject to ongoing regulation.\nAny products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements on us and our third-party manufacturers. Even after regulatory approval is obtained, under certain circumstances, such as later discovery of previously unknown safety risks, the FDA can withdraw approval or subject the drug to additional restrictions.\nOur use of hazardous materials could subject us to liability, fines and sanctions.\nLaboratory and clinical testing sometimes involve the use of hazardous, radioactive or otherwise toxic materials. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing how we use, manufacture, handle, store and dispose of these materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply in all material respects with all federal, state and local laws and regulations, there is always the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be subject to liability, fines and sanctions, and our business may suffer.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you may lose all or part of your investment. These fluctuations could be based on various factors, including factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and below:\n\u2022\nchanges in analyst estimates, ratings and price targets;\n\u2022\nnegative press reports or other negative publicity, whether or not true, about our business;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry in general;\n\u2022\nmarket sentiment towards pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning the overall economy; and\n\u2022\nmarket sentiment toward equity securities.\nWe have never paid a dividend on shares of our common stock, and you should rely on price appreciation of shares of our common stock for return on your investment.\nWe have never paid a dividend on shares of our common stock. Even if we decide to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on our future results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors. You should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock and should rely on price appreciation of shares of our common stock for return on your investment.\nConversion of our convertible preferred stock would result in substantial dilution for our existing shareholders of common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 27.2 million shares of common stock outstanding. We may be required to issue up to approximately 6.7 million additional shares of common stock upon conversion of existing convertible preferred stock. The issuance of these additional shares would represent approximately 20% dilution to our existing shareholders of common stock.\nIf we need to obtain additional financing in the future, such financing could result in dilution to your investment, adversely affect the price per share of our common stock and/or create future operating and financial restrictions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash of $87.8 million. GIAPREZA is our only approved product and our only source of product revenue. To reach the point at which we are able to generate positive cash flow from operations, we may need to raise additional capital. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, if any, will depend on many factors, including the success of our commercialization efforts for GIAPREZA, our ability to receive a tropical disease PRV and our ability to control expenses. If necessary, we will raise additional capital through equity or debt financings. We can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we issue additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, you will suffer dilution to your investment, and such issuance may adversely affect the price per share of our common stock. Any new debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations, which may include limitations on borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens or pay dividends.", "PERMNO": 80640, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "LJPC"}
