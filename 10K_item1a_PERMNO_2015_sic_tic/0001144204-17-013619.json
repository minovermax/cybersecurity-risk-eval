RISK FACTORS\nThe following important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Actual dollar amounts are used in this Item 1 A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe highly cyclical nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and available cash.\nThe tanker industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company\u2019s control. The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company\u2019s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG\u2019s quarterly results and cash flows. Factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity include:\n\u00b7 supply and demand for, and availability of, energy resources such as oil, oil products and natural gas, which affect customers\u2019 need for vessel capacity;\n\u00b7 global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes, that among other things could impact the supply of oil, as well as trading patterns and the demand for various vessel types;\n\u00b7 regional availability of refining capacity and inventories;\n\u00b7 changes in the production levels of crude oil (including in particular production by OPEC, the United States and other key producers);\n\u00b7 changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported, changes in the price of crude oil and changes to the West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil pricing benchmarks;\n\u00b7 environmental and other legal and regulatory developments and concerns;\n\u00b7 construction or expansion of new or existing pipelines or railways;\n\u00b7 weather and natural disasters;\n\u00b7 competition from alternative sources of energy; and\n\u00b7 international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions or nationalizations and wars.\nFactors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include:\n\u00b7 the number of newbuilding deliveries;\n\u00b7 the scrapping rate of older vessels;\n\u00b7 the number of vessels being used for storage;\n\u00b7 the conversion of vessels from transporting oil and oil products to carrying dry bulk cargo or vice versa;\n\u00b7 the number of vessels that are removed from service;\n\u00b7 availability and pricing of other energy sources such as natural gas for which tankers can be used or to which construction capacity may be dedicated;\n15 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\n\u00b7 port or canal congestion; and\n\u00b7 environmental and maritime regulations.\nMany of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, or to retain in service older obsolescent capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time.\nThe market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG\u2019s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition.\nThe market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including:\n\u00b7 age of the vessel;\n\u00b7 general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry, including the availability of vessel financing;\n\u00b7 number of vessels in the Jones Act fleet;\n\u00b7 types and sizes of vessels available;\n\u00b7 changes in trading patterns affecting demand for particular sizes and types of vessels;\n\u00b7 cost of newbuildings;\n\u00b7 prevailing level of charter rates;\n\u00b7 competition from other shipping companies and from other modes of transportation; and\n\u00b7 technological advances in vessel design and propulsion.\nJones Act vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years. In addition, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of the Company\u2019s vessels at the time of any vessel sale. If OSG sells a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel\u2019s carrying amount on the Company\u2019s financial statements, OSG will incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. In addition, declining values of the Company\u2019s vessels could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels.\nDeclines in charter rates and other market deterioration could cause OSG to incur impairment charges.\nThe Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that have occurred to determine whether they indicate that the carrying amount of the vessel assets might not be recoverable. This review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is complex and requires the Company to make various estimates, including future freight rates, earnings from the vessels, market appraisals and discount rates. All of these items have historically been volatile. The Company evaluates the recoverable amount of a vessel asset as the sum of its undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If the recoverable amount is less than the vessel\u2019s carrying amount, the vessel\u2019s carrying amount is then compared to its estimated fair value, which is determined using vessel appraisals or discounted estimated future cash flows. If the vessel\u2019s carrying amount is less than its fair value, it is deemed impaired. The carrying values of the Company\u2019s vessels may differ significantly from their fair market value. Impairment charges aggregating $104.4 million on seven of the Company\u2019s eight rebuilt Jones Act ATBs were recorded during 2016.\nAn increase in the supply of vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to decline, which could adversely affect OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as the value of its vessels.\nThe marine transportation industry has historically been highly cyclical, as the profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply and demand of vessels. If the number of new ships of a particular class delivered exceeds the number of vessels of that class being scrapped, available capacity in that class will increase. In the U.S. domestic market, as of December 31, 2016, there were firm orders to build five tankers and four ATBs, representing approximately 10% of the existing Jones Act fleet of Product Carriers and large ATBs (defined as vessels having carrying capacities of between 0.14 million barrels and 0.35 million barrels, which excludes numerous tank barges below 0.14-million- barrel capacity and 11 much larger tankers dedicated exclusively to the Alaskan crude oil trade). Given the smaller number of tankers operating in the U.S. domestic market, even a limited increase in capacity supply may negatively impact the market and may have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows.\n16 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nShipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG\u2019s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses.\nOSG\u2019s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 marine disasters;\n\u00b7 bad weather;\n\u00b7 mechanical failures;\n\u00b7 human error;\n\u00b7 war, terrorism and piracy;\n\u00b7 grounding, fire, explosions and collisions; and\n\u00b7 other unforeseen circumstances or events.\nIn addition, transporting crude oil is at risk of business interruptions due to labor strikes, port closings and boycotts. These hazards may result in death or injury to persons; loss of revenues or property; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to OSG\u2019s customer relationships; and market disruptions, delay or rerouting, which may also subject OSG to litigation. In addition, the operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are also exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and high volume of the oil transported in tankers. Furthermore, any such incident could seriously damage OSG\u2019s reputation and cause OSG either to lose business or to be less likely to enter into new business (either because of customer concerns or changes in customer vetting processes). Any of these events could result in loss of revenues, decreased cash flows and increased costs.\nWhile the Company carries insurance to protect against certain risks involved in the conduct of its business, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG\u2019s $1 billion per vessel insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. There are certain liability limits and standards established under OPA 90 and CERCLA that may impact our operations. See Item 1. \u201cU.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards\u201d above for additional information. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and OSG cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid by its insurers. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company\u2019s losses, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG\u2019s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits and cash flows or cause losses.\nConstraints on capital availability have adversely affected the tanker industry and OSG\u2019s business.\nConstraints on capital that have occurred during recent years have adversely affected the financial condition of certain of the Company\u2019s customers, financial lenders and suppliers. Entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG including the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG or the inability or unwillingness of financial lenders to honor their commitments to lend funds. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of its customers, financial lenders and suppliers, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG, which could also have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows.\n17 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nThe Company also faces other potential constraints on capital relating to counterparty credit risk and constraints on OSG\u2019s ability to borrow funds. See also, \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Company ___ The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and any failure by these counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings\u201d and \u201c Risks Related to Our Company ___ OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.\u201d\nThe current state of the financial markets and current economic conditions may adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and otherwise negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nFinancial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile. In recent years, businesses in the economy have faced tightening credit, weakening demand for goods and services, deteriorating liquidity conditions, volatile interest rates, and declining markets. There has been a general decline in the willingness of banks and other financial institutions to extend credit, particularly in the shipping industry, due to the historically volatile asset values of vessels. As the shipping industry is highly dependent on the availability of credit to finance and expand operations, companies within the shipping industry have been negatively affected by this decline.\nAlso, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as many lenders have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt and reduced, and in some cases ceased to provide, funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, additional financing may not be available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If additional financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, the Company may be unable to meet its obligations as they come due or the Company may be unable to execute its business strategy, complete additional vessel acquisitions, or otherwise take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nOSG conducts certain of its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business.\nThe Company conducts certain of its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed.\nOSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. Moreover, the shipping industry is generally considered to present elevated risks in these areas. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company\u2019s business operations and on the Company\u2019s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company\u2019s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. OSG\u2019s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts.\nChanges in fuel prices may adversely affect profits.\nFuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in the Company\u2019s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company\u2019s control, including geopolitical developments; supply and demand for oil and gas; actions by OPEC, and other oil and gas producers; war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions; regional production patterns; and environmental concerns. Fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company\u2019s business compared to other forms of transportation.\nPublic health threats could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nPublic health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world near where OSG operates, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations, the operations of the Company\u2019s customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for crude oil and the level of demand for OSG\u2019s services. Any quarantine of personnel, restrictions on travel to or from countries in which OSG operates, or inability to access certain areas could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. Travel restrictions, operational problems or large-scale social unrest in any part of the world in which OSG operates, or any reduction in the demand for tanker services caused by public health threats in the future, may impact OSG\u2019s operations and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\n18 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nActs of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s fleet operates mainly in U.S. waters, there are occasions when a vessel may be in an area where pirate attacks are a concern. The frequency of pirate attacks on seagoing vessels remains high, particularly in the western part of the Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Africa and in the South China Sea. If piracy attacks result in regions in which the Company\u2019s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as \u201cwar risk\u201d zones, as the Gulf of Aden has been, or Joint War Committee \u201cwar and strikes\u201d listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks.\nIn addition, while OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not \u201con-hire\u201d for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim the Company would dispute. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against the Company\u2019s vessels, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels, could have a material adverse impact on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company\u2019s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters.\nTerrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG\u2019s business.\nTerrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company\u2019s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. In addition, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. In the past, political instability has also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nAs a result of the spin-off of INSW on November 30, 2016, OSG\u2019s historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of OSG\u2019s future financial results and the spin-off may adversely affect OSG\u2019s business.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, the assets and liabilities and results of operations of INSW are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to OSG\u2019s continuing operations, unless specifically noted. Accordingly, the historical financial information included in this Annual Report does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, operating performance or cash flows that OSG would have achieved without INSW as a wholly owned subsidiary during the periods presented or those that OSG will achieve in the future, including as a result of the following factors:\n\u00b7 Prior to the spin-off, OSG or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for INSW, such as treasury, accounting, auditing, legal, investor relations and finance. OSG\u2019s historical results reflect allocations of corporate expenses to INSW for such functions. In connection with the spin-off, OSG may incur additional expenses for such services after the spin-off.\n\u00b7 As a result of the spin-off, the cost of capital of OSG\u2019s business may be higher than its cost of capital prior to the spin-off.\nOSG may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the spin-off or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The anticipated benefits may not be achieved for a variety of reasons, including among others:\n\u00b7 The separation of our business from INSW and provision of services to INSW under the Transition Services Agreement require significant amounts of management\u2019s time and effort in developing standalone organizations which may divert management\u2019s attention from operating and growing OSG\u2019s business;\n\u00b7 Following the spin-off, OSG may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if INSW was still a part of OSG; and\n\u00b7 Following the spin-off, OSG\u2019s business is less diversified and has a more concentrated exposure to U.S specific risks such as the Jones Act market than prior to the spin-off.\nIf OSG fails to achieve some or all of the benefits to result from the spin-off, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have an adverse effect on OSG\u2019s competitive position, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\n19 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nOSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2016, OSG had $525.1 million of outstanding indebtedness. OSG\u2019s substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including:\n\u00b7 limiting OSG\u2019s ability to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations in other areas of its business, including for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities, because OSG must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service its debt;\n\u00b7 to the extent OSG\u2019s future cash flows are insufficient, requiring the Company to seek to incur additional indebtedness in order to make planned capital expenditures and other expenses or investments;\n\u00b7 limiting OSG\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and other expenses or investments planned by the Company;\n\u00b7 limiting the Company\u2019s flexibility and ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, and OSG\u2019s business and industry;\n\u00b7 limiting OSG\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness;\n\u00b7 increasing OSG\u2019s vulnerability to a downturn in its business and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally;\n\u00b7 placing OSG at a competitive disadvantage as compared to its less-leveraged competitors;\n\u00b7 limiting the Company\u2019s ability, or increasing the costs, to refinance indebtedness; and\n\u00b7 limiting the Company\u2019s ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom OSG can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions.\nOSG\u2019s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company\u2019s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, the actual or perceived credit quality of the Company\u2019s charterers (as well as any defaults by them) could materially affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain the additional capital resources that it will require to purchase additional vessels or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such capital. The Company\u2019s inability to obtain additional financing at a higher-than-anticipated cost, or at all, could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operation and its ability to implement its business strategy.\nThe Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, and could in the future breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly over time due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, as well as general economic and market conditions affecting the industry. As a result, the amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate in other periods and its ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may vary. Additionally, future cash flow may be insufficient to meet the Company\u2019s debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG\u2019s business.\nThe OBS Term Loan and the ABL Facility contain certain restrictions relating to new borrowings and, the movement of funds between OBS and OSG, as set forth in the loan agreement. Furthermore, drawdowns under the OBS ABL Facility borrowings are limited based upon the available borrowing base, as defined in that loan agreement and, if availability falls below a certain amount for a specified period of time, the administrative agent could exercise cash dominion rights permitting it to invoke control rights over certain of our accounts. While the Company was in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2016, a decrease in vessel values could cause the Company to breach certain covenants its existing credit facilities and term loans, or in future financing agreements that the Company may enter into from time to time. If the Company breaches such covenants and is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company\u2019s lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on the Company\u2019s owned vessels.\n20 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nA range of economic, competitive, financial, business, industry and other factors will affect future financial performance, and, accordingly, the Company\u2019s ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay debt. Many of these factors, such as charter rates, economic and financial conditions in the tanker industry and the economy or competitive initiatives of competitors, are beyond the Company\u2019s control. If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u00b7 refinancing or restructuring its debt;\n\u00b7 selling tankers or other assets;\n\u00b7 reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures; or\n\u00b7 seeking to raise additional capital.\nUndertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, might not allow OSG to meet its debt obligations. The Company\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. The 8.125% unsecured Notes will mature on March 30, 2018. To remain in compliance with the OBS ABL Facility, the Company\u2019s current plan is to pay off or refinance the outstanding balance on its 8.125% unsecured Notes by December 29, 2017. Any refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG\u2019s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting certain alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company\u2019s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet the covenants of its credit agreements and term loans and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances, could materially and adversely affect OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company will be required to make additional capital expenditures to expand the number of vessels in its fleet and to maintain all of its vessels, which depend on additional financing.\nThe Company has not started or completed construction on any vessels during the five years ended December 31, 2016. The Company\u2019s business strategy is based in part upon the expansion of its fleet through the purchase of additional vessels at attractive points. If OSG is unable to fulfill its obligations under any memorandum of agreement or newbuilding construction contract for future vessel acquisitions, the sellers of such vessels may be permitted to terminate such contracts and the Company may be required to forfeit all or a portion of the down payments it made under such contracts and it may also be sued for any outstanding balance. In addition, as a newbuilding vessel must be drydocked within five years of its delivery from a shipyard, with survey cycles of no more than 60 months for the first three surveys, and 30 months thereafter, not including any unexpected repairs, the Company will incur significant maintenance costs for its existing and any newly-acquired vessels. As a result, if the Company does not utilize its vessels as planned, these maintenance costs could have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters.\nOSG\u2019s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new charters will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal. As of December 31, 2016, OSG employed 16 vessels on Time Charters, with eight of those charters expiring in 2017, five expiring in 2018, one expiring in 2019, one expiring in 2020 and one expiring in 2025. The Company\u2019s existing Time Charters may not be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed or entered into, those new contracts may be at less favorable rates. In addition, there may be a gap in employment of vessels between current charters and subsequent charters. If at a time when OSG is seeking to arrange new charters for its vessels, market participants expect that less capacity will be necessary in the future (for example, if it is expected that oil and natural gas prices will decrease in the future, which could suggest that future oil and gas production levels will decline from then-current levels), OSG may not be able to obtain charters at attractive rates or at all. If, upon expiration of the existing Time Charter, OSG is unable to obtain Time Charters or Voyage Charters at desirable rates, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIn the highly competitive Jones Act market, OSG may not be able to compete effectively for charters.\nThe Company\u2019s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition, and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company\u2019s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does.\n21 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nOSG may not realize the benefits it expects from past acquisitions or acquisitions or other strategic transactions it may make in the future.\nOSG\u2019s business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in material acquisitions of assets or ownership interests in entities in the tanker industry and of individual tankers. The success of OSG\u2019s acquisitions will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within its control. These factors include OSG\u2019s ability to:\n\u00b7 identify suitable tankers and/or shipping companies for acquisitions at attractive prices, which may not be possible if asset prices rise too quickly;\n\u00b7 obtain financing;\n\u00b7 identify businesses engaged in managing, operating or owning tankers for acquisitions or joint ventures;\n\u00b7 integrate any acquired tankers or businesses successfully with the OSG\u2019s then-existing operations; and\n\u00b7 enhance OSG\u2019s customer base.\nOSG intends to finance these acquisitions by using available cash from operations and through incurrence of debt or bridge financing, either of which may increase its leverage ratios, or by issuing equity, which may have a dilutive impact on its existing shareholders. At any given time, OSG may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more acquisitions, some of which may be material to OSG as a whole. These opportunities require confidentiality and may involve negotiations that require quick responses by OSG. Although there can be no certainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions, the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of OSG\u2019s securities.\nAcquisitions and other transactions can also involve a number of special risks and challenges, including:\n\u00b7 diversion of management time and attention from the Company\u2019s existing business and other business opportunities;\n\u00b7 delays in closing or the inability to close an acquisition for any reason, including third-party consents or approvals;\n\u00b7 any unanticipated negative impact on the Company of disclosed or undisclosed matters relating to any vessels or operations acquired; and\n\u00b7 assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation related to the acquired business.\nThe success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses or assets into OSG\u2019s current operations. Such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel and clients, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, risk of non-compliance with internal controls over financial reporting for an acquired company, in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company or asset. OSG may not realize the strategic and financial benefits that it expects from any of its past acquisitions, or any future acquisitions. Further, if a portion of the purchase price of a business is attributable to goodwill and if the acquired business does not perform up to expectations at the time of the acquisition some or all of the goodwill may be written off, adversely affecting OSG\u2019s earnings. OSG has recorded material write-offs of goodwill and intangible assets in prior years related to earlier acquisitions it consummated.\nChanges in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently trades may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets.\nThe Company deploys its vessels in several specialized markets, including, without limitation, Lightering in the Delaware Bay. The Company conducts those Lightering operations with two ATBs which were constructed using funds withdrawn from the CCF. If there is lower demand in these markets, the Company may have to consider redeploying these two ATBs in other markets. If that occurs, the Company may not be able to compete profitably in the new markets, and the ATBs may not be able to be redeployed to new markets without substantial modification. In addition, we would be required to pay daily liquidated damages to MARAD if those vessels were deployed in the contiguous coastwise trades.\n22 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nOperating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company\u2019s vessels age and may also increase due to unanticipated events relating to secondhand vessels and the consolidation of suppliers.\nIn general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. As of December 31, 2016, the weighted average age of the Company\u2019s total owned and operated fleet was 9.4 years, which is based on the vessels\u2019 year of rebuild, where applicable. Cargo insurance rates are also expected to increase with the age of a vessel, since older vessels may be less desirable to charterers. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG\u2019s currently operated vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. Every commercial tanker must pass inspection by a Classification Society authorized by the vessel\u2019s country of registry. The Classification Society certifies that a tanker is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rule and regulations of the country of registry of the tanker and the international conventions of which that country is a number. If a Classification Society requires the Company to add equipment, OSG may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its older vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. If a vessel in OSG\u2019s fleet does not maintain its class and/or fails any survey, it will be unemployable and unable to trade between ports. This would negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operation.\nFurthermore, recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies. With respect to certain items, OSG is generally dependent upon the original equipment manufacturer for repair and replacement of the item or its spare parts. Supplier consolidation may result in a shortage of supplies and services, thereby increasing the cost of supplies or potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on time. These cost increases or delays could result in downtime, and delays in the repair and maintenance of the Company\u2019s vessels and have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The Company\u2019s top five customers comprised approximately 59% of the Company\u2019s revenues during 2016. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban could adversely impact the Company.\nOver the last four decades, the ability of U.S. producers to export domestic crude oil has been restricted by the U.S. government. In December 2015, the U.S. government enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, which, among other things, removed the restriction on the export of domestic crude oil from the United States. The removal of the crude oil export restrictions may result in a continuing decline in demand for coastwise transportation of crude oil, which may have an adverse impact on the Company.\nCertain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if they have been subsequently rebuilt.\nAll of the Company\u2019s existing ATBs with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350 and the OSG Horizon/OSG 351 were originally constructed more than 25 years ago. While all of these tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are \u201cin-class,\u201d meaning the vessel has been certified by a Classification Society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that Classification Society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel\u2019s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. Other customers may not continue to view rebuilt vessels as suitable. With an increase in the supply of newer vessels, customers may become more selective. If more customers differentiate rebuilt vessels, time charter rates for the Company\u2019s rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s significant operating leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.\nThe Company\u2019s operating fleet includes ten vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. The significant operating leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\n23 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nThe Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings.\nThe Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts, including charter agreements and other agreements associated with the operation of its vessels. The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters COAs and Voyage Charters. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire but the economic downturn of recent years has affected charterers more severely than the prior recessions that have occurred since the Company\u2019s establishment more than 45 years ago. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (interest rate swaps and caps) from time to time. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks. The ability of each of the Company\u2019s counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with it will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the overall financial condition of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and various expenses. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company\u2019s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is currently under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, the Company\u2019s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings.\nThe Company depends on its key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees.\nOSG\u2019s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of key personnel or the Company\u2019s inability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, several of the Company\u2019s executive officers have served in their current positions for less than one year. Accordingly, the management team has not worked together as a team for a significant period of time and their focus and attention may be diverted while they familiarize themselves with OSG\u2019s business.\nWork stoppages or other labor disruptions by the unionized employees of OSG or other companies in related industries may adversely affect OSG\u2019s operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, OSG had approximately 882 regular full-time employees, of which 632 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness __ Employees.\u201d OSG could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of OSG or other companies in related industries (including third parties providing services to OSG) against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices or the failure of OSG or other companies in its industry to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements.\nThe Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels.\nVessels must be drydocked periodically. For example, the USCG requires the Company\u2019s vessels to be drydocked for inspection and maintenance twice every five years. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty, can be substantial and the Company\u2019s insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage, and OSG\u2019s insurance may not cover all of these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly the length of time that a vessel may be off-hire may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTechnological innovation could reduce the Company\u2019s charter income and the value of the Company\u2019s vessels.\nThe charter rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessel\u2019s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. The length of a vessel\u2019s physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations. If new tankers are built that are more efficient or more flexible or have longer physical lives than the Company\u2019s vessels, competition from these more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the amount of charter payments the Company receives for its vessels once their initial charters expire and the resale value of the Company\u2019s vessels could significantly decrease. As a result, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nInterruption or failure of OSG\u2019s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business.\nOSG is highly dependent on information technology systems. These dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and communication systems. Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG\u2019s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure of OSG\u2019s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability for the release of confidential information.\n24 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud.\nThe Company maintains a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires the Company to anticipate and react to changes in its business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy its reporting obligations as a public company.\nThe spin-off of INSW involved significant changes to the Company\u2019s operations and senior management, including those with primary responsibility for maintaining the system of internal controls. The management team has not worked together as a team for a significant amount of time, and their focus and attention may be diverted while they familiarize themselves with OSG\u2019s business and gain knowledge of the Company\u2019s financial reporting controls.\nAny system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and harm its business. Furthermore, investors\u2019 perceptions that the Company\u2019s internal controls are inadequate or that the Company is unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm its stock price.\nDelays or disruptions in implementing new technological and management systems could impair the Company\u2019s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.\nThe Company is currently in the process of transitioning to a new software system for managing ship operations. In addition, from time to time the Company will implement or upgrade certain other technological resources utilized in running its business. The Company could be adversely affected if the new software system it is implementing for managing ship operations or other new or upgraded technological systems are defective, not installed properly, fail to perform as marketed or are not properly integrated into existing operations. In addition, the implementation of a new system may not result in improvements that outweigh the cost of implementation. System implementation failures could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, and ability to operate in a complex industry.\nWe could face significant liability if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities and we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are parties to collective-bargaining agreements that require them to make contributions to three jointly managed (Company and union) multiemployer pension plans covering seagoing personnel of U.S. Flag vessels. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Certain of these multiemployer plans are currently underfunded. Significantly underfunded pension plans are required to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, our required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. In addition, a termination of, our voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer pension plan to which we contribute would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer pension plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities. See Note 17, \u201cPension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information. Requirements to pay increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by potential changes in U.S. tax laws.\nThe U.S. Congress and the new Administration have indicated an interest in U.S. corporate income tax reform, with possible approaches including lowering the corporate income tax rate and disallowing any deduction for interest expense except to the extent of interest income. We had significant deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016, which consists primarily of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that are expected to be realized over an extended number of years. Although any reduction in the corporate income tax rate would reduce the amount of taxes we would pay in the future, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate would also result in a decrease in the value of our net operating loss carryforwards and a reduction to our net income and total equity during the period in which the rate reduction is enacted. We also currently benefit from the deduction of interest expense on our indebtedness. Any elimination or modification of that deduction may increase our cash taxes payable, reducing our future cash available for operations and dividend payments.\n25 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nThe Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act\u2019s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur.\nA significant majority of the Company\u2019s operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and are governed by U.S. federal laws commonly known as the \u201cJones Act\u201d. The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of goods between points in the United States to vessels meeting certain requirements, including ownership and control by \u201cU.S. Citizens\u201d as defined thereunder. The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In addition, under certain circumstances failure to comply with the Jones Act may result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines.\nAdditionally, maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (\u201cGATS\u201d) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government could requisition the Company\u2019s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash.\nThe U.S. government could requisition one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels for title or hire. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. In addition, two OSG vessels participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. These vessels are required to trade outside the United States but are eligible for government-sponsored business. Under the program, OSG receives an annual fee, subject in each case to annual Congressional appropriations, in exchange for a guarantee that the ships will be made available to the U.S. government in the time of war or national emergency. The U.S. government requisition of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash.\nCompliance with complex laws, regulations, and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect OSG\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills. They also regulate other water pollution issues, including discharge of ballast water and effluents and air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG, including, without limitation, ones related to engine adjustments and ballast water treatment.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company\u2019s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company\u2019s vessels.\nOSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability.\n26 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nIn addition, in complying with OPA 90, IMO regulations and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners likely will incur substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in meeting new regulatory requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Key regulatory initiatives that are anticipated to require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in the next several years include more stringent limits on the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in certain areas and more stringent requirements for management and treatment of ballast water.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s vessels are subject to more stringent numeric discharge limits of ballast water under the EPA\u2019s VGP, with additional vessels becoming subject in future years, even though those vessels have obtained a valid extension from the USCG for implementation of treatment technology under the USCG\u2019s final rules. The EPA has determined that it will not issue extensions under the VGP but has stated that vessels that (i) have received an extension from the USCG (ii) are in compliance with all of the VGP requirements other than numeric discharge limits and (iii) meet certain other requirements will be entitled to \u201clow enforcement priority\u201d. While OSG believes that any vessel that is or may become subject to the more stringent numeric discharge limits of ballast water meets the conditions for \u201clow enforcement priority,\u201d no assurance can be given that they will do so. If the EPA determines to enforce the limits for such vessels, such action could have a material adverse effect on OSG. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness ___ Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.\u201d\nOther government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become stricter in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG\u2019s financial statements. Additionally, the failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. If any of our vessels are denied access to, or are detained in, certain ports, reputation, business, financial results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nAccidents involving highly publicized oil spills and other mishaps involving vessels can be expected in the tanker industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company\u2019s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial results and cash flows. In addition, the Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations. The Company believes its vessels are maintained in good condition in compliance with present regulatory requirements, are operated in compliance with applicable safety and environmental laws and regulations and are insured against usual risks for such amounts as the Company\u2019s management deems appropriate. The vessels\u2019 operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during each vessel\u2019s required annual survey. However, government regulation of tankers, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact may change in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to its ships to keep them in compliance.\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the IMO and the UN, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company\u2019s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness ___ Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.\u201d In addition to the added costs, the concern over climate change and regulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce global demand for oil and oil products, which would have an adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial results and cash flows.\nThe employment of the Company\u2019s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors\u2019 risk assessment process.\nThe shipping industry, and especially vessels that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products, is heavily regulated. In addition, the \u201coil majors\u201d such as BP, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips Company, Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell, and Total S.A. have developed a strict due diligence process for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel, including audits of the management office and physical inspections of the ship. Under the terms of the Company\u2019s charter agreements, the Company\u2019s charterers require that the Company\u2019s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits respectively. The Company\u2019s failure to maintain any of its vessels to the standards required by the oil majors could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement. Should the Company not be able to successfully clear the oil majors\u2019 risk assessment processes on an ongoing basis, the future employment of the Company\u2019s vessels could be adversely affected since it might lead to the oil majors\u2019 terminating existing charters.\n27 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nThe Company may be subject to litigation and government inquiries or investigations that, if not resolved in the Company\u2019s favor and not sufficiently covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on it.\nThe Company has been and is, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters and subject to government inquiries and investigations. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business.\nAdditionally, there are a number of pending lawsuits alleging injuries related to purported asbestos exposure in various state and federal courts. The Company believes it has insurance coverage for the majority, though not all, of these cases.\nAlthough the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, it cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such matter, and the ultimate outcome of these matters or the potential costs to resolve them could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to OSG\u2019s rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases and/or insurers may not remain solvent which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition. The Company\u2019s recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for its contingent liabilities are based on its assessment of potential liability using the information available to the Company at the time and, as applicable, any past experience and trends with respect to similar matters. However, because litigation is inherently uncertain, the Company\u2019s estimates for contingent liabilities may be insufficient to cover the actual liabilities from such claims, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d and Note 21, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statement and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nThe smuggling of drugs or other contraband onto the Company\u2019s vessels may lead to governmental claims against the Company.\nThe Company expects that its vessels will call in ports where smugglers attempt to hide drugs and other contraband on vessels, with or without the knowledge of crew members. To the extent the Company\u2019s vessels are found with contraband, whether inside or attached to the hull of our vessel and whether with or without the knowledge of any of its crew, we may face governmental or other regulatory claims which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMaritime claimants could arrest OSG\u2019s vessels, which could interrupt cash flows.\nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels could interrupt OSG\u2019s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. Claimants could try to assert \u201csister ship\u201d liability against one vessel in the Company\u2019s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet which, if successful, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. federal income tax position in respect of certain credit agreement borrowings used by INSW is not free from doubt.\nThe Company has taken the position that certain drawdowns by the Company under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility used solely by INSW should not be taken into account in determining amounts includible in OSG\u2019s income as deemed dividends under section 951(a)(1)(B) and section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for taxable years 2013 and earlier. Although the Company believes that it has a strong basis for taking this position, there is no authority directly on point and the Company has established a reserve in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 740. If the IRS were to challenge the Company\u2019s position, the Company\u2019s total cash exposure could exceed the reserve, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n28 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nTransfers or issuances of the Company\u2019s equity may impair or reduce the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An \u201cownership change\u201d is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation\u2019s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation, or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the company\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an \u201cownership change,\u201d it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Common Stock and Warrants\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s securities may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s securities may fluctuate substantially. You may not be able to resell your Class A common stock or Class A warrants at or above the price you paid for such securities due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. These risks include those described or referred to in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and under \u201cForward -Looking Statements,\u201d as well as, among other things: fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operating results; activities of and results of operations of the Company\u2019s competitors; changes in the Company\u2019s relationships with the Company\u2019s customers or the Company\u2019s vendors; changes in business or regulatory conditions; changes in the Company\u2019s capital structure; any announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures; additions or departures of key personnel; investors\u2019 general perception of the Company; failure to meet market expectations; future sales of the Company\u2019s securities by it, directors, executives and significant stockholders; changes in domestic and international economic and political conditions; and other events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events. Any of the foregoing factors could also cause the price of the Company\u2019s equity securities to fall and may expose the Company to securities class action litigation. Any securities class action litigation could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIn addition, the stock market has recently experienced volatility that, in some cases, has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s securities, regardless of its actual operating performance.\nThe Company\u2019s warrants are thinly traded, and your ability to sell such securities may be limited.\nThe Company\u2019s Class A warrants are currently traded as \u201crestricted securities\u201d in the over-the-counter market and in privately negotiated transactions among individual holders pursuant to exemptions from the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Transactions are reported as taking place only sporadically. Certain broker-dealers report quotes for the purchase and sale of Class A warrants. The Company cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Class A warrants, your ability to sell your Class A warrants or the price at which you would be able to sell such securities.\nThe exercise of outstanding warrants may result in substantial dilution to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nAs of March 3, 2017, the Company had outstanding 89,255,322 Class A warrants with an exercise price of $0.01 per share exercisable into an aggregate of 16,958,511 shares of Class A common stock. If exercised, the shares of Class A common stock underlying these warrants would represent, as of that date, approximately 19% of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class A common stock following such exercise. Accordingly, any such exercise would result in substantial dilution to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is subject to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could have a negative impact on the transferability of the Company\u2019s common stock, its liquidity and market value, and on a change of control of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws authorize its Board of Directors to establish with respect to any class or series of capital stock of the Company certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to transfer of shares, to assist in monitoring and maintaining compliance with the Jones Act ownership restrictions. In order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors has determined that until further action by it, at least 77% (the \u201cMinimum Percentage\u201d) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company must be owned by U.S. Citizens. Moreover, the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws provide that any purported transfer of equity interests in the Company that caused the percentage of outstanding shares of a class of capital stock of the Company to fall below the Minimum Percentage will be ineffective to transfer the equity interests or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with such interests.\n29 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nThe percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock fluctuates based on daily trading, and at times in the past, including at times in 2015 and 2016, has declined to the Minimum Percentage. At and during such time that the Minimum Percentage is reached with respect to outstanding shares of a class of the Company\u2019s stock, the Company is unable to issue any further shares of such class of common stock or approve transfers of such class of common stock to non-U.S. Citizens among other things. The existence and enforcement of these ownership restrictions could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of the Company\u2019s equity securities. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the ownership restrictions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s outstanding warrants are not subject to the above ownership restrictions, but the warrants include provisions limiting the right of non-U.S. Citizens to exercise warrants if the shares of common stock that would be issued upon exercise would cause the percentage of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock held by U.S. Citizens to decline below the Minimum Percentage.\nThe Company has a limited history of paying cash dividends on its securities.\nThe Company has not paid any regular cash dividends since the third quarter of 2011. On February 29, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per share of common stock paid prior to the end of March 2016. The declaration and timing of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements, general financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law or the SEC and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nOSG is a holding company and depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it in order to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends.\nOverseas Shipholding Group, Inc. is a holding company and its subsidiaries conduct all of its operations and own all of its operating assets. It has no significant assets other than the equity interests in its subsidiaries. As a result, its ability to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it. In addition, the terms of the OBS Term Loan and the ABL Facility restrict the ability of OBS and its subsidiaries to distribute funds to Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nSome provisions of Delaware law and the Company\u2019s governing documents could influence its ability to effect a change of control.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and contained in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. In addition, these provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of the Company\u2019s board of directors. For example, the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws:\n\u00b7 give the sole ability to then-current members of its board of directors to fill a vacancy on the board of directors;\n\u00b7 require the affirmative vote of two-thirds or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of its capital stock in order to amend or repeal certain provisions of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws; and\n\u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for nomination for elections to its board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese and other provisions of the Company\u2019s organizational documents and Delaware law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing changes of control or changes in management, even if such transactions or changes would have significant benefits for its stockholders. As a result, these provisions could limit the price some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nSeparately, the Company has elected to opt out of Section 203 (\u201cSection 203\u201d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which restricts certain business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d Accordingly, the Company will be able to enter into such transactions with its principal stockholders without complying with the requirements of Section 203. The election to opt out of Section 203 could deprive certain stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company, particularly if it enters into a transaction with an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d\n30 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.", "PERMNO": 51457, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "OSG"}
