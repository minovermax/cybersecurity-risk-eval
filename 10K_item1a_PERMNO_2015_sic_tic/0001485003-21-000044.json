{"cik": "1485003", "company": "Sesen Bio, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. The occurrence of any of the following risks and uncertainties, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In these circumstances, the market price of our common shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Risks and uncertainties of general applicability and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Over the past few years, we have focused primarily on developing our lead product candidate, Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. Since our inception, we have received no revenues from sales of our products, have incurred significant operating losses and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the follow-up stage of our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and seek marketing approval from the FDA. We had net losses of $22.4 million, $107.5 million and $33.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We incurred negative cash flows from operating activities of $30.8 million, $37.5 million and $22.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $52.4 million, net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $44.8 million and an accumulated deficit of $315.9 million. We have financed our operations to date primarily through private placements of our common stock, preferred stock, common stock warrants and convertible bridge notes, venture debt borrowings, our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), our follow-on public offerings, sales effected in ATM offerings and, our out-licensing and commercialization partnership agreements. The majority of our revenue to date has been from milestone payments received under our out-licensing and commercialization partnership agreements. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nWe expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we:\n\u2022seek marketing approval for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in the United States and Europe;\n\u2022establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved;\n\u2022adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed drugs;\n\u2022continue our clinical development activities for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, including a post-marketing confirmatory trial;\n\u2022seek and conduct combination trials of one or more of our product candidates;\n\u2022seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022in-license or acquire the rights to other products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022seek marketing approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022add equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development;\n\u2022hire additional clinical, quality control, scientific and management personnel, including personnel to support our commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022expand our operational, financial and management systems and personnel.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those expected or if there are any delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase.\nWith the exception of specified regulatory, development and commercial milestones under our out-licensing and commercialization partnership agreements, we currently have no source of product revenue and may never become profitable.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. Although we may be entitled to certain payments under our out-licensing and commercialization partnership agreements, neither we nor any of our commercialization partners have commercialized any of our product candidates. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from the development of our product candidates unless and until we or one of our commercialization partners obtain marketing approval\nfor, and commercialize, Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. Our ability to generate revenue from Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize, Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC;\n\u2022our ability to complete and submit applications to, and obtaining regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022the size of the markets in the territories for which we or our commercialization partners gain regulatory approval;\n\u2022our ability to find a suitable contract sales organization (\"CSO\") to help us market and promote Vicineum, if approved;\n\u2022our ability to develop and maintain effective medical affairs, sales, marketing and distribution to market and sell Vicineum, if approved;\n\u2022our ability to enter into and maintain commercially reasonable agreements with wholesalers, distributors and other third parties in our supply chain;\n\u2022our success in establishing a commercially viable price for Vicineum, if approved;\n\u2022our success in defending against potential competition and other developments in our market generally;\n\u2022our ability to manufacture commercial quantities of Vicineum at acceptable cost levels;\n\u2022our ability to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors; and\n\u2022our and our commercialization partners' ability to successfully complete development activities, including the necessary clinical trials, for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.\nEven if Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC is approved for commercial sale, Vicineum may not gain market acceptance or achieve commercial success. If our addressable market is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or clinical practice guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of Vicineum. In addition, we would anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing Vicineum, if approved. We may not achieve profitability soon after generating product sales from Vicineum, if ever. If we are unable to generate product revenues from Vicineum, we will not become profitable and may be unable to continue operations without continued funding.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain drug approvals, diversify our offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe are devoting substantial financial resources to our ongoing and planned activities including functions associated with operating as a public company. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the success of our commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved;\n\u2022the outcome, timing and cost of the regulatory approval process for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC by the FDA, including the potential for the FDA to require that we perform more studies and clinical trials than those we currently expect;\n\u2022the costs and timing of the implementation of commercial-scale manufacturing activities;\n\u2022our ability to establish and maintain commercial arrangements on favorable terms, if at all, particularly manufacturing, marketing and distribution arrangements for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC;\n\u2022the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022our obligation to make milestone, royalty and other payments to third party licensors under our in-licensing agreements;\n\u2022the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; and\n\u2022the effect of competing technological and market developments.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts, when required or on acceptable terms, we also could be required to:\n\u2022seek out-licensing or commercialization partners to assist in the commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in the United States and other markets;\n\u2022relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC or our other product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop and commercialize ourselves;\n\u2022delay, limit, reduce or terminate the drug development of our product candidates, or seek commercialization partnerships for one or more of our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u2022significantly curtail our operations.\nBased on our current operating plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents of $52.4 million as of December 31, 2020 will be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2021; however, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our capital resources may be utilized faster than we currently expect.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations and insufficient cash resources raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or engage in another strategic transaction on acceptable terms and when needed, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. While we believe that our cash and cash equivalents of $52.4 million at December 31, 2020 will be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2021, given our planned expenditures for the next several years, we and our independent registered public accounting firm have concluded that there is a substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nFuture sales and issuances of shares of our common stock or rights to purchase shares of our common stock, including common stock purchase warrants and stock options, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, licensing and commercialization partnership agreements, strategic alliances and marketing and distribution arrangements and other commercial arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds other than the amounts payable under our out-licensing and commercialization partnership agreements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 rights as holders of our common stock. For example, as of December 31, 2020, and subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events, including stock dividends, stock splits and distributions of cash, up to 2,246,594 shares of our common stock could be issuable by us, with a weighted-average exercise price of $0.82 per share, in connection with the exercise of our outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock.\nWe have also adopted the 2014 Plan to enable us and our subsidiaries to recruit and retain highly qualified employees, directors and consultants, provide those individuals with an incentive for productivity, and provide those individuals with an opportunity to share in our growth and value. As of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate of 10,146,844 stock options outstanding under the 2014 Plan, our prior equity plan and inducement awards granted outside of our equity plans. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had 4,863,562 shares of common stock available for grant under our 2014 Plan. Future equity incentive grants and issuances of shares of common stock under the 2014 Plan, or other grants outside of the 2014 Plan pursuant to inducement equity awards, may have an adverse effect on the market price of shares of our common stock.\nFurther, debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, licensing or commercialization partnership agreements, strategic alliances or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be\nfavorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval of Vicineum\nWe are dependent on our lead product candidate, Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. If we are unable to obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize our lead product candidate, either alone or through an out-license or a commercialization partnership, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. Our prospects are substantially dependent on our out-licensing and commercialization partners' ability to obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. The success of Vicineum will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022developing and maintaining the commercial manufacturing supply and distribution chain for Vicineum;\n\u2022performance of our future out-licensing or commercialization partners, if any;\n\u2022extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022launch of commercial sales, if and when marketing approval is received;\n\u2022demonstration of an acceptable safety profile prior to and following any marketing approval;\n\u2022marketplace acceptance, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022establishing and maintaining pricing sufficient to realize a meaningful return on our investment; and\n\u2022competition with other therapies.\nIf we or our commercialization partners are unable to develop, receive marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC or experience delays as a result of any of these factors or otherwise, our business could be materially harmed.\nIf clinical trials of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be delayed or unable to complete, the development and commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, we must complete pre-clinical development and conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Vicineum in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and preliminary results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, pre-clinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their product candidates.\nClinical trial results may fail to support approval of our product candidates.\nEven if our clinical trials are successfully completed as planned, the results may not support approval of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC under the laws and regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate Vicineum is both safe and effective for its intended uses. Pre-clinical and clinical data and analyses are often able to be interpreted in different ways. Even if we view our results favorably, if a regulatory authority has a different view, we may still fail to obtain regulatory approval of Vicineum. This, in turn, would significantly adversely affect our business prospects.\nVicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC may cause undesirable side effects, serious adverse events or have other properties that could delay or halt clinical trials, delay or prevent its regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of its labeling, if approved, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.\nUndesirable side effects or serious adverse events caused by Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt respective clinical trials and could result in a restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nThere were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 serious adverse events that were considered by the clinical investigators to be related to Vicineum during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of Vicineum for the treatment of NMIBC BCG failures. There was one Grade 5 serious adverse event, or death, which was determined by the clinical investigator to be unrelated to Vicineum. The most common reported treatment-related adverse events were an abnormally frequent passage of small amounts of urine, blood in the urine and painful urination, the majority of which were considered to be mild or moderate in severity. No patients discontinued treatment due to a Vicineum-related adverse event during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.\nAs of the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date, in patients across all cohorts (n=133) of our Phase 3 VISTA Trial of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, 88% experienced at least one adverse event, with 95% of adverse events being Grade 1 or 2. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were dysuria (14%), hematuria (13%) and urinary tract infection (12%) - all of which are consistent with the profile of bladder cancer patients and the use of catheterization for treatment delivery. These adverse events were determined by the clinical investigators to be manageable and reversible, and only four patients (3%) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Serious adverse events, regardless of treatment attribution, were reported in 14% of patients. There were four treatment-related serious adverse events reported in three patients including acute kidney injury (Grade 3), pyrexia (Grade 2), cholestatic hepatitis (Grade 4) and renal failure (Grade 5). There were no age-related increases in adverse events observed in the VISTA Trial.\nIn addition, side effects and serious adverse events or further safety or toxicity issues that we may experience in our clinical trials or in post-marketing experience could lead to the FDA's or other comparable foreign regulatory authority's\nimposition of a REMS or other post-marketing obligations, which could hinder us from generating revenues or achieving profitability. Results of our clinical trials could reveal an unacceptably high severity and prevalence of side effects or serious adverse events. As a result, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development or deny approval of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. The related drug-side effects or serious adverse events in our clinical trials could affect clinical trial patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the clinical trial or result in potential product liability claims.\nAdditionally, if Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects or serious adverse events caused by Vicineum, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022we may suspend or be forced to suspend marketing of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC;\n\u2022we may be obliged to conduct a product recall or product withdrawal;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may suspend, vary, or withdraw their approvals of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may order the seizure or recall of Vicineum;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or a REMS or other post-marketing obligations that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC;\n\u2022we may be required to conduct post-marketing studies;\n\u2022we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022we could be required to pay fines and face other administrative, civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved.\nWe are seeking in the U.S. and intend to seek outside the U.S., approval for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC through the use of accelerated approval pathways. If we are unable to obtain approval under an accelerated pathway, we may be required to conduct additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials beyond those that we contemplate, which could increase the expense of obtaining, and delay the receipt of, necessary marketing approvals. Even if we receive accelerated approval from the FDA, if our confirmatory trial(s) do not verify clinical benefit, or if we do not comply with rigorous post-marketing requirements, the FDA may seek to withdraw accelerated approval.\nWe are seeking in the U.S., and intend to seek outside the U.S., approval for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC under accelerated approval pathways. On February 16, 2021, the Company announced that the FDA has accepted for\nfiling the Company\u2019s BLA for Vicineum, for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, and granted the application Priority Review. With Priority Review, the anticipated target PDUFA date for a decision on the BLA is August 18, 2021.\nUnder the accelerated approval provisions in the FDCA and the FDA\u2019s implementing regulations, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product designed to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA considers a clinical benefit to be a positive therapeutic effect that is clinically meaningful in the context of a given disease. For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit.\nThere can be no assurance that our BLA will be approved by the FDA on a timely basis, or at all. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities also could require us to conduct further studies or trials prior to granting approval of any type. A failure to obtain accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or approval for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC would result in a longer time period to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, could increase the cost of development of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and could harm our competitive position in the marketplace.\nMoreover, even if we receive accelerated approval from the FDA, we will be subject to rigorous post-marketing requirements, including the completion of confirmatory post-market clinical trial(s) to verify the clinical benefit of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, and submission to the FDA of all promotional materials 30-120 days prior to their dissemination. The FDA could seek to withdraw accelerated approval for multiple reasons, including if we fail to conduct any required post-market study with due diligence, our confirmatory post-market clinical trial(s) do not confirm the predicted clinical benefit, other evidence shows that the product is not safe or effective under the conditions of use, and/or we disseminate promotional materials that are found by the FDA to be false and misleading.\nBecause we plan to produce commercial supply of our product candidate Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved, through third-party manufacturers, the FDA will require us to demonstrate that the product manufactured by our third-party manufacturers is comparable in quality, safety, and efficacy to the product that was used in our clinical trials. If we experience challenges in demonstrating comparability, or if the FDA requires additional nonclinical or clinical studies to demonstrate comparability, the marketing approval and/or commercialization of Vicineum could be delayed, adversely affected or terminated, or may result in significantly higher costs.\nOur product candidate, Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, has been produced in our own manufacturing facility for all clinical trials for Vicineum to date, including our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial. In September 2017, we completed the manufacturing of all Vicineum necessary for our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial and for our CRADA with the NCI. In conjunction with this achievement, we ended our manufacturing activities at our facility in Winnipeg and have redirected our resources toward completing the technology transfer process necessary to outsource commercial scale drug supply manufacturing to third-party manufacturers in the event we obtain approval from the FDA to market Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. We have had discussions with the FDA regarding the criteria for demonstrating comparability of Vicineum produced by our third-party manufacturers to Vicineum produced in our own manufacturing facility.\nAs of December 2, 2020, we had received and analyzed from our third-party manufacturers all of the analytical comparability test results from the commercial-scale drug substance and drug product process performance qualification batches of Vicineum. For analytical comparability, we conducted testing across four categories: release testing, biophysical characterization, forced degradation studies, and stability studies. This approach is in alignment with requirements of the FDA, the EMA and the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. The test results for Vicineum intended for commercial use were found to be highly comparable to our clinical supply of Vicineum. Based on these results, we are optimistic that the FDA will determine that the commercial supply of Vicineum is comparable to the clinical supply of Vicineum, and that no additional clinical trials are warranted.\nBecause this manufacturing change was introduced at an advanced stage of development of Vicineum, the FDA may require a comprehensive comparability assessment, potentially including additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials utilizing Vicineum produced by our third-party manufacturers, and/or a modification of our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial to include Vicineum produced by our third-party manufacturers. Such requirements could result in lengthy delays and significantly higher costs for the clinical development, approval of our BLA, and potential commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. If we are unable to demonstrate to the FDA comparability of Vicineum produced in our own manufacturing to Vicineum produced by our third-party manufacturers, we may not be able to obtain marketing approval of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.\nThe marketing approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. As a result, we cannot predict when or if we, or any licensees or partners, will obtain marketing approval to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC or any other product candidate.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years, especially if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s quality, safety, and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that any product candidate that we may develop is not safe, effective or of appropriate quality, is only moderately effective or has undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nThe different requirements and expectations of the comparable regulatory authorities compared with the FDA may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post approval limitations or restrictions. If we experience delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad, and any approval we are granted for our product candidates in the United States would not assure approval of product candidates in foreign jurisdictions.\nIn order to market and sell any product candidate that we may develop outside of the United States, we or our third-party licensees or commercialization partners must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be sold in that country. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Vicineum\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved, among physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, Vicineum may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors or the medical community. Vicineum based on our TFPT platform, which is a new technology and therapeutic approach. Market participants with significant influence over acceptance of new treatments, such as physicians and third-party payors, may not adopt a product or treatment based on our TFPT platform and technologies, and we may not be able to convince the medical community and third-party payors to accept and use, or to provide favorable reimbursement for, Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. Market acceptance of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved, depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the perceived quality, efficacy and safety of Vicineum;\n\u2022clinical indications for which Vicineum is approved;\n\u2022availability of alternative effective treatments for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and the relative risks, benefits and costs of those treatments;\n\u2022acceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer clinics and patients of Vicineum as a safe and effective treatment for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC;\n\u2022the success of our physician education programs;\n\u2022potential and perceived advantages of Vicineum over alternative treatments;\n\u2022safety of Vicineum seen in a broader patient group, potentially including its use outside the approved indication should physicians choose to prescribe them for such uses;\n\u2022prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022any new or unexpected results from additional clinical trials or further analysis of clinical data of completed clinical trials by us or our competitors;\n\u2022product labeling or patient information requirements imposed by the FDA;\n\u2022timing of market introduction of Vicineum as well as competitive products;\n\u2022the pricing of our treatments, particularly in relation to alternative treatments, and willingness and ability of patients to pay for Vicineum;\n\u2022availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022maintaining compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u2022relative convenience and ease of administration; and\n\u2022effectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution efforts and operations.\nIf Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC is approved but fails to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors or the medical community, we may not be able to generate significant revenues, which would compromise our ability to become profitable.\nThe market opportunity for Vicineum may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for established therapies or for whom prior therapies have failed, and may be small.\nCancer therapies are sometimes characterized as first-line, second-line or third-line. When cancer is detected early enough, first-line therapy, usually chemotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery, radiotherapy or a combination of these, is sometimes adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. Second-line and third-line therapies are administered to patients when prior therapy is not effective. We are seeking approval of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC after prior therapies have failed.\nOur projections of both the number of people who have BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, as well as the subset of people with this cancer who have previously failed prior treatments, and who have the potential to benefit from treatment with Vicineum, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these cancers and the number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. Even if we receive regulatory approval for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and obtain significant market share, because the potential target population is small, we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications, including the use of Vicineum as a first-line therapy.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if and when it is approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of therapeutic products. To achieve commercial success for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved, we will need to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, either ourselves or through commercialization partnerships or other arrangements with third parties.\nThere are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved, on our own include:\n\u2022our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products;\n\u2022the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nWe may enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services in markets outside the United States. We may also enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services in the United States if we do not\nestablish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in the United States or if we determine that such third-party arrangements are otherwise beneficial. Our product revenues and our profitability, if any, under any such third-party sales, marketing or distribution arrangements are likely to be lower than if we were to market, sell and distribute Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved, or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved, effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new biologics products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC from both large and small pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations. There are a number of large pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. For instance, in January 2020, the FDA approved Merck & Co., Inc.'s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) as a systemic monotherapy to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy. In addition, FerGene Inc. is developing Adstiladrin (nadofaragene firadenovec (rAd-IFN/Syn3) for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC for the United States market and presented Phase 3 data in December 2019, and its BLA has been accepted by the FDA for review. On May 17, 2020, the FDA issued a complete response letter that indicated outstanding questions regarding CMC and manufacturing issues of Adstiladrin. A new PDUFA date has not been disclosed yet. In addition, in February 2021, FerGene issued a letter to Key Opinion Leaders, also referred to as KOLs stating additional delays leading to the restructuring of their organization and the elimination of commercial positions. In September 2020, CG Oncology (CG0070, a recombinant adenovirus type 5, same type as Adstiladrin) initiated a Phase 3 study for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive patients with expected primary and study completion dates of December 2022 and December 2024, respectively. In December 2020, ImmunityBio (Anktiva/N-803 in combination with BCG) released preliminary Phase 2 data for the CIS cohort and is expected to file its BLA following a meeting with the FDA in the second half of 2021. However, the Phase 2 trial did not include a BCG only control arm. In May 2020, the preliminary results of the Phase 2 study of Tecentriq for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive CIS patients were presented at ASCO by the NCI (National Cancer Institute) which sponsored the trial. The data showed that the trial did not meet its primary endpoint and further development of Tecentriq remains uncertain. There is intense and rapidly evolving competition in the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and antibody fragment and immuno-oncology therapeutics fields. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than product candidates that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nIn addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors, particularly Medicare, seeking to encourage the use of generic drug products. Generic products are currently being used as part of the standard of care for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If any product candidate that we may develop achieves marketing approval, we expect that it will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.\nMore established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash resources and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. As a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates before we are able to, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and less expensive than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. These appreciable advantages could render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of development and commercialization.\nOur product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biological products may face competition from biosimilar products.\nWith the enactment of the BPCIA, abbreviated pathways for approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products were created. The BPCIA establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilars for marketing, as well as\nbiosimilars that have been designated as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with a previously approved biologic, or reference product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the reference product was approved under a full BLA. This period of regulatory exclusivity runs concurrently with, but is independent of, periods of patent protection for the reference product.\nWe believe that any of our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, approved as a biological product under a full BLA should qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity. However:\n\u2022the United States Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten this exclusivity period as has been previously proposed; and\n\u2022a potential competitor could seek and obtain approval of its own BLA during our exclusivity period instead of seeking approval of a biosimilar version.\nThe BPCIA is complex and its provisions continue to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA and United States courts. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and implications of the BPCIA are subject to uncertainty and could compromise the future commercial prospects for our biological products. Moreover, it is not yet clear the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, may be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for pharmaceutical products; this will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing at both the federal and state levels of government.\nEven if we are able to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, it may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage or reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for Vicineum will be available from government healthcare programs, private health insurers, managed care plans and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved, and, even if they are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. For example, if CMS were to implement the \u201cMost Favored Nation\u201d demonstration model to pay for drugs and biologicals under Medicare Part B, and Vicineum, if approved, were to be included in the demonstration, the Medicare reimbursement level for the product may be materially reduced, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInadequate reimbursement may adversely affect the demand for, or the price of, Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the clinical setting in which a drug is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved, would compromise our ability to generate revenues and become profitable.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is\ngranted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in that country. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC to other available therapies. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, even if Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC obtains marketing approval.\nThere can be no assurance that Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, any of our other product candidates or any products that we may in-license, if they are approved for sale in the United States or in other countries, will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that they will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that coverage and an adequate level of reimbursement will be available, or that third-party payors\u2019 reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. In addition, we are unable to predict what changes in legislation or regulation relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future and how such legislation or regulation could impact our business.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the use of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and will face an even greater risk if Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC receives marketing approval and is commercialized. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial patients;\n\u2022significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial patients;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022reduced time and attention of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u2022the inability to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.\nWe currently hold $10.0 million CAD in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $10.0 million CAD, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We would need to increase our insurance coverage if we expand our clinical development activities beyond historical levels. We would need to further increase our insurance coverage if Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC is approved and we commence commercialization. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe will depend on Qilu for the development and commercialization of Vicineum in the greater China region.\nOn July 30, 2020 we entered into the Qilu License Agreement. Under the terms of the Qilu License Agreement, Qilu has an exclusive license to manufacture, develop and commercialize Vicineum in the greater China region, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. The timing and amount of any milestone and royalty payments we may receive under the Qilu License Agreement will depend in part on Qilu\u2019s efforts. We will also depend on Qilu to comply with all applicable laws relative to the manufacturing, development and commercialization of Vicineum in the greater China region. We do not control the individual efforts of Qilu, and any failure by Qilu to devote sufficient time and effort to the manufacture, development and commercialization of Vicineum could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and operations, such as by a failure of Qilu to meet its obligations to us, including future milestone and royalty payments. In addition, if Qilu were to violate, or was alleged to have violated, any laws or regulations during the performance of its obligations for us, it is possible that we could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences.\nAny termination, breach or expiration of the Qilu License Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial position by reducing or eliminating the potential for us to receive milestones and royalties. In such an event, we may be required to devote additional efforts and to incur additional costs associated with pursuing the manufacture, development and commercialization of Vicineum in greater China. If we breach our obligations under the Qilu License Agreement and are unable\nto cure such breach, Qilu may terminate the Qilu License Agreement and retain all rights to manufacture, develop and commercialize Vicineum in the greater China region with no obligation to make any additional milestone or royalty payments. Qilu has the right to receive a refund of all amounts paid us in the event the Qilu License Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances. In addition, the royalty rate is subject to reduction under certain circumstances, including when there is no valid claim of a licensed patent for Vicineum in a particular region or no data or regulatory exclusivity for Vicineum in a particular region.\nWe depend on the Roche License Agreement for the development and commercialization of EBI-031.\nIn June 2016, we entered into the Roche License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Roche an exclusive, worldwide license, including the right to sublicense, to the Licensed Intellectual Property. Under the Roche License Agreement, Roche is required to continue developing, at its cost, EBI-031 and any other product made from the Licensed Intellectual Property that contains a Licensed Product and pursue ongoing patent prosecution, at its cost. At the time of the Roche License Agreement, EBI-031, which was derived using our previous AMP-Rx platform, was in pre-clinical development as an intravitreal injection for diabetic macular edema and uveitis.\nWe received from Roche an upfront license fee of $7.5 million in August 2016 upon the effectiveness of the Roche License Agreement following approval by our stockholders, and Roche agreed to pay up to an additional $262.5 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory, development and commercial milestones with respect to up to two unrelated indications. Specifically, an aggregate amount of up to $197.5 million is payable to us for the achievement of specified milestones with respect to the first indication, consisting of (i) $72.5 million in development milestones, the first of which is $20.0 million for initiation of the first Phase II study, (ii) $50.0 million in regulatory milestones and (iii) $75.0 million in commercialization milestones. In September 2016, Roche paid us the first development milestone of $22.5 million as a result of the IND application for EBI-031 becoming effective on or before September 15, 2016. Additional amounts of up to $65.0 million are payable upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones in a second indication.\nIn addition, we are entitled to receive royalty payments in accordance with a tiered royalty rate scale, with rates ranging from 7.5% to 15% of net sales of potential future products containing EBI-031 and up to 50% of these rates for net sales of potential future products containing other IL-6 compounds, with each of the royalties subject to reduction under certain circumstances and to the buy-out options of Roche.\nThe Roche License Agreement provides for two \u201coption periods\u201d during which Roche may elect to make a one-time payment to us and, in turn, terminate its diligence, milestone and royalty payment obligations under the Roche License Agreement. Specifically, (i) Roche may exercise a buy-out option following the first dosing (\"Initiation\") in the first Phase 2 study for a Licensed Product until the day before Initiation of the first Phase 3 study for a Licensed Product, in which case Roche is required to pay us $135.0 million within 30 days after Roche\u2019s exercise of such buy-out option and receipt of an invoice from us, or (ii) Roche may exercise a buy-out option following the day after Initiation of the first Phase 3 study for a Licensed Product until the day before the acceptance for review by the FDA or other regulatory authority of a BLA or similar application for marketing approval for a Licensed Product in either the United States or in the E.U., in which case Roche is required to pay us, within 30 days after Roche\u2019s exercise of such buy-out option and receipt of an invoice from us, $265.0 million, which amount would be reduced to $220.0 million if none of our patent rights containing a composition of matter claim covering any compound or Licensed Product has issued in the E.U.\nThe right to potential future payments under the Roche License Agreement represents a significant portion of the value of the Roche License Agreement to us. We cannot be certain that we will receive any future payments under the License Agreement, which would adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business prospects.\nAdditionally, if Roche were to breach or terminate the Roche License Agreement, we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for EBI-031 and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize EBI-031. We may not be able to seek and obtain a viable, alternative partner for the development and commercialization of the licensed products on similar terms, or at all.\nWe may enter into additional commercialization partnerships or out-license agreements with third parties for the commercialization or development of our product candidates. If our commercialization partnership or out-licenses are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe may seek additional third-party partners or licensees for development and commercialization of our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. Our likely commercialization partners or licensees for any sales, marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader partnership arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our partners' or licensees' abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCommercialization partnerships and licenses involving our product candidates, including the Roche License Agreement, pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022commercialization partners or licensees have significant discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these partnerships or licenses;\n\u2022commercialization partners or licensees may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022commercialization partners or licensees may not pursue commercialization and development of our product candidates that receive marketing approval or may elect not to continue or renew commercialization or development programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the partners' or licensees' strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u2022commercialization partners or licensees may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022commercialization partners or licensees could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the partners or licensees believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022product candidates discovered under the commercialization partnership or license with us may be viewed by our partners or licensees as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause partners or licensees to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022a commercialization partner or licensee with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u2022disagreements with commercialization partners or licensees, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would divert management attention and resources, be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022commercialization partners or licensees may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022commercialization partners or licensees may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u2022commercialization partners or licenses may be terminated for the convenience of the partner or licensee and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nCommercialization partnership agreements and licenses may not lead to commercialization or development of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. If any partnerships or licenses that we enter into, do not result in the successful commercialization and development of products or if one of our partners or licensees terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the commercialization partnership or license. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K also apply to the activities of any current or future commercialization partners and licensees.\nAdditionally, subject to its contractual obligations to us, if a partner or licensee of ours were to be involved in a business combination, it might deemphasize or terminate the commercialization or development of any product candidate licensed to it by us. If one of our partners or licensees terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new partners or licensees and our perception in the business and financial communities could be harmed.\nIf we are not able to establish additional commercialization partnerships, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans and our business could be adversely affected.\nFor some of our product candidates, we may decide to partner with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of such product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners. Whether we reach a definitive commercialization partnership agreement will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the partner\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed commercialization partnership and the proposed partner\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership\nwithout regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The partner may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a commercialization partnership could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential commercialization partners. Commercialization partnerships are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future partners.\nIf we are unable to reach agreements with suitable partners on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into partnerships and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product platform.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe rely on domestic and international third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our pre-clinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, and we control only some aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on third parties to assist in conducting our pre-clinical studies in accordance with GLP and the Animal Welfare Act requirements. We and our CROs are required to comply with U.S. federal regulations and GCP, which are international standards meant to protect the rights and health of patients and assure the credibility of clinical trial data that are enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, non-clinical and pre-clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nBecause we have relied and will continue to rely on third parties, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be adversely affected. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we lose our relationships with CROs, our product development efforts could be delayed.\nWe rely on domestic and international third-party vendors and CROs for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials related to our product development efforts. Switching or adding additional CROs would involve additional cost and requires management time and focus. Our CROs generally have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements and/or research projects with us\npursuant to such agreements if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the patients participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination in accordance with the reasonable opinion of the relevant CRO. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nOur experience manufacturing Vicineum is limited to our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. We have no experience manufacturing Vicineum on a commercial scale. We are dependent on third parties for our supply chain, and if we experience problems with any such third parties, the manufacturing of Vicineum could be delayed.\nOur product candidate, Vicineum, for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, has been produced in our own manufacturing facility for all clinical trials for Vicineum to date, including our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial. In September 2017, we completed the manufacturing of all Vicineum necessary for our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial and for our CRADA with the NCI. In conjunction with this achievement, we ended our manufacturing activities at our facility in Winnipeg and have redirected our resources toward completing the technology transfer process necessary to outsource commercial scale drug supply manufacturing to third-party manufacturers in the event we obtain approval from the FDA to market Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.\nAny significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business. Any significant delay in the supply of Vicineum or its key materials could considerably delay the commercial launch of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of Vicineum.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to certain risks that we would not be subject to if we manufactured Vicineum ourselves, including:\n\u2022The development of commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities may require our third-party manufacturers to invest substantial additional funds and hire and retain technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience. Our third-party manufacturers may fail to devote sufficient time and resources to develop the capabilities to manufacture Vicineum.\n\u2022Because of the complex nature of Vicineum, our third party manufacturers, or other third parties we rely on, may encounter difficulties in achieving the volume of production needed to satisfy commercial demand, may not be able to achieve such volume at an acceptable cost, may experience technical issues that impact comparability, quality, or compliance with applicable regulations governing the manufacture of biological products, and may experience shortages of qualified personnel to adequately staff production operations.\n\u2022Our third-party manufacturers could default on their agreements with us to meet our requirements for commercialization of Vicineum, or it may terminate or decide not to renew their agreements with us, based on their own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. If our third-party manufacturers were to terminate our arrangements or fail to meet our commercial manufacturing demands, we may be delayed in our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of Vicineum or, if approved, commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.\n\u2022It may be difficult or impossible for us to find replacement manufacturers on acceptable terms quickly, or at all. Identifying alternate manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers that have the necessary expertise to produce biologics is limited. Additionally, the FDA must approve any alternative manufacturer before we may use the alternative manufacturer to produce the commercial supply of Vicineum, if approved.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers reduces our control over our commercialization activities, but does not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable legal and regulatory standards. The FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities require that our products candidates and any products that we may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Methods of manufacture as well as validation of manufacturing procedures and quality control systems are reviewed by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to determine their effect on the quality, purity and potency of product candidates. All such manufacturing procedures, validation programs and quality assessment activities must be properly documented in accordance with regulatory requirements. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or similar foreign standards or to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA or any other foreign regulatory authorities to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing\nclinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention of product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, imposing administrative or civil penalties, or pursuing criminal prosecution.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or products that we license from them, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to Vicineum and our other proprietary technology and product candidates. We and our licensors have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and product candidates. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications in jurisdictions of interest at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If such licensors fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors\u2019 pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our owned or licensed patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In particular, during prosecution of any patent application, the issuance of any patents based on the application may depend upon our ability to generate additional pre-clinical or clinical data that support the patentability of our proposed claims. We may not be able to generate sufficient additional data on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. In addition, invalidation of our patent rights by third parties could jeopardize the anticipated revenue streams from current licensees.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit\nthe duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on Vicineum and our other product candidates and technologies throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws and practices of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Moreover, the intellectual property laws of the United States change over time. For example, several United States Supreme Court cases have redefined what is considered to be patentable subject matter. Consequently, we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our and our licensors\u2019 inventions in all countries inside or outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our and our licensors\u2019 inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may export infringing products to territories where we or our licensors have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our or our licensor\u2019s patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally in those countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our and our licensors\u2019 patents at risk of being invalidated or being interpreted narrowly and put our and our licensors\u2019 patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors. We or our licensors may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our licensors initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nThe laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and these foreign laws may also be subject to change. For example, methods of treatment and manufacturing processes may not be patentable in certain jurisdictions, and the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. Furthermore, generic and/or biosimilar product manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our or our licensors\u2019 patents, requiring us or our licensors to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings.\nGeneric or biosimilar product manufacturers may develop, seek approval for, and generic versions or biosimilar versions, respectively, of our products. The FDA has published several guidance documents on biosimilar product development. If a biosimilar product is also found to be interchangeable with a reference product, it may be substituted for the reference product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation, which are still being worked out by the FDA. If any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA, the approval of a biologic product biosimilar to or interchangeable with one of our products could have a material impact on our business. In particular, a biosimilar could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our products, if approved by the FDA.\nMany countries, including E.U. countries, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under certain circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our and our licensors\u2019 efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nOur future trademark applications may not be allowed for registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections from the USPTO or other applicable foreign intellectual property offices. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections, or have to expend additional resources to secure registrations, such as commencing cancellation proceedings against third-party trademark registrations to remove them as obstacles to our trademark applications. In addition,\nin the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against third parties than we otherwise would.\nWe depend on our license agreements with Zurich, Micromet and XOMA, and if we cannot meet the requirements under the agreements we could lose important rights to Vicineum, which could have material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have an exclusive license agreement with Zurich. Pursuant to the agreement, we were granted an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under certain patents primarily relating, in part, to our targeting agents, EpCAM chimera and immunoconjugates (including aspects of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN) and methods of use, to make, use, sell and import products that would otherwise infringe such patents in the field of the treatment, stasis and palliation of disease in humans. If we fail to meet our obligations under the license agreement, Zurich may have the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to use the licensed Zurich patent rights would end. To the extent such licensed technology or patent rights relate to our product candidates, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patent rights licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the license agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights licensed to us under the license agreement, and to the extent such patent rights and other technology relate to our product candidates or other of our compounds, it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN.\nWe also have a license agreement with Micromet, which grants us non-exclusive rights, with certain sublicense rights, for know-how and patents allowing exploitation of certain single chain antibody products. If we fail to meet our obligations under the license agreement, Micromet may have the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to use the licensed Micromet patent rights would end. To the extent such licensed technology or patent rights relate to our product candidates, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patent rights licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the license agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights licensed to us under the license agreement, and to the extent such patent rights and other technology relate to our product candidates or other of our compounds, it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN.\nWe also have a license agreement with XOMA, which grants us non-exclusive rights,with certain sublicense rights, to certain XOMA patent rights and know-how related to certain expression technology, including plasmids, expression strains, plasmid maps and production systems. If we fail to meet our obligations under the license agreement, XOMA may have the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to use the licensed XOMA patent rights and related know-how would end. To the extent such licensed technology or patent rights relate to our product candidates, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patent rights licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the license agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights licensed to us under the license agreement, and to the extent such patent rights and other technology relate to our product candidates or other of our compounds, it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, trademarks or other intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. In a trademark infringement proceeding, we could be enjoined from continued use of a trademark deemed to be infringing and forced to rebrand product packaging, product inserts, market and advertising materials, resulting in a loss of sales and established\ngoodwill in that name or mark. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a trademark.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our partners, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. The risks of being involved in such litigation and proceedings may increase as our product candidates near commercialization and as we gain the greater visibility associated with being a public company. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates and their uses. Thus, we do not know with certainty that any product candidate, or our commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe or otherwise violate any third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees, consultants, independent contractors or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees and our licensors\u2019 employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at universities, medical institutions or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including members of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors\nand other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022others may be able to make product candidates that are the same as or similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have licensed;\n\u2022biosimilar product manufacturers may develop, seek approval for, and launch biosimilar versions of our products, which could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our products;\n\u2022we or our licensors might not have been the first inventor to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022others may design around our intellectual property rights or independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents with claims that cover our products or even issued patents;\n\u2022issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u2022our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022we may not develop additional proprietary technologies or product candidates that are patentable; and\n\u2022the intellectual property rights of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance\nEven if we obtain marketing approvals for one or more of our product candidates, the terms of such approvals, ongoing regulations and post-marketing restrictions may limit how we manufacture and market such products, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nOnce marketing approval has been granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation. We must therefore comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription products are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, if any product candidate that we may develop receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our product, which could limit sales of the product.\nIn addition, manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We and our contract manufacturers will also be subject to other regulatory requirements, including submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians, recordkeeping, and potentially costly post-marketing studies or other clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product such as the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.\nAccordingly, assuming we receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, we and our contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we are not\nable to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any future products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Thus, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAny product candidate, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to a strict enforcement of post-marketing requirements and we could be subject to substantial penalties, including withdrawal of our product from the market, if we fail to comply with all regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical trials, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities. These requirements include, but are not limited to, restrictions governing promotion of an approved product, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. The respective safety and efficacy profiles of our product candidates will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities if they are approved. If new safety information becomes available after approval of our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, the FDA may require labeling changes or establishment of a REMS, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require a similar strategy, impose significant restrictions on our product candidates\u2019 indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.\nThe FDA and other federal and state agencies, including the DOJ closely regulate compliance with all requirements governing prescription drug products, including requirements pertaining to marketing and promotion of drugs in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and manufacturing of products in accordance with cGMP requirements. Violations of such requirements may lead to investigations alleging violations of the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act and other federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws as well as state consumer protection laws. In the United States, engaging in impermissible promotion of approved products for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, and other litigation and/or investigation, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute our drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal civil False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in any fines or settlement funds. These False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have led to several substantial civil and criminal settlements. These lawsuits have increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay settlement fines or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, or may be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully market our approved products, we may become subject to such litigation and/or investigation and, if we are not successful in defending against such actions, those actions could compromise our ability to become profitable. Our failure to comply with all regulatory requirements, and later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022litigation involving patients taking our products;\n\u2022restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022restrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022recall of products;\n\u2022fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022damage to relationships with any potential commercialization partners or licensees;\n\u2022unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n\u2022refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022product seizure or detention; or\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit or preclude our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue.\nNon-compliance by us with regulatory requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties.\nOur failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security, data collection, and privacy is increasingly demanding. In the United States, we are subject to a number of data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security) at both the federal and state levels. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. Numerous federal and state laws, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, such as Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (\u201cFTC Act\u201d), govern the collection, use, and disclosure of health-related and other personal information.\nIn addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements in the United States under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA-other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits-we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain, use or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. Finally, a data breach affecting sensitive personal information, including health information, could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to U.S. data protection laws and regulations, we also may be subject to European and other international data protection requirements. For example, E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) imposes detailed requirements related to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data related to EU data subjects the collection and use of personal health data in the E.U.\nIn particular, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States, unless there is a suitable data transfer solution in place to safeguard personal data. These countries include the United States. Transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States is only permitted if there is an appropriate transfer mechanism or derogation for the transfer of personal data, such as the existence of certain agreements which incorporate the standard contractual clauses as issued by the European Commission, or if there is another appropriate transfer mechanism or derogation in accordance with chapter V GDPR for the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States.\nNoncompliance with the GDPR can result in fines of up to 4% of total annual worldwide turnover or up to \u20ac20 million (whichever is higher).\nMany of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult, constantly evolving, and time consuming. Our failure to comply with these laws, or changes in the way in which these laws are implemented, could lead to unfavorable outcomes, including increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, regulatory liability as a result of government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, civil liability as a result of claims initiated by data subjects (including claims initiated as class actions) contracting parties or other third parties as a result of non-compliance with data protection laws and/or contractual obligations, and adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and our overall and business. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, including class action attorneys, have been and will likely continue to be active in this space. Such liabilities could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and our overall business.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by United States federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which\nwe conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022the federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties;\n\u2022HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry relating to the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered products to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals and certain other healthcare providers; and\n\u2022analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency statutes, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain healthcare providers, and restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs; and state laws that require identification or licensing of sales representatives.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government funded healthcare programs. See the subsection titled \u201cOther Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements\u201d in Item 1. Business above for additional information.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any commercialization partners, to profitably sell any products for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any commercialization partners, may receive for any approved products.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act established the Medicare Part D program and generally authorized prescription drug plan sponsors to impose limits on the number of covered drugs under their plans in a therapeutic class. The Medicare Modernization Act, including its cost reduction initiatives, could decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we may receive for any of our product candidates, if approved. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also may revise reimbursement and implement coverage restrictions. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nIn addition, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the ACA. Among the provisions of the ACA of potential importance to our business and our product candidates are the following:\n\u2022an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription products and biological products;\n\u2022an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the MDRP to 23.1% for innovator drugs and 13% for non-innovator drugs of the AMP;\n\u2022a new methodology by which AMP is calculated and reported by manufacturers for products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies;\n\u2022expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand products to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers\u2019 outpatient products to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well;\n\u2022expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act's 340B drug pricing program;\n\u2022new requirements to report to CMS annually specifying financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the ACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any \u2018\u2018payments or other transfers of value\u2019\u2019 made or distributed to prescribers, teaching hospitals, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year;\n\u2022a new requirement to annually report product samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;\n\u2022a mandatory non-deductible payment for employers with 50 or more full-time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents;\n\u2022establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models; and\n\u2022a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nCertain provisions of the ACA have been subject to judicial challenges, as well as efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the tax-based payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Code, commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the Medicare statute, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare prescription drug plans, commonly known as the \u201cdonut hole,\u201d by raising the manufacturer discount under the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program to 70%. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the ACA remain possible. It is unclear how the ACA and its implementation, as well as efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify, or invalidate, the ACA, or portions thereof, will affect our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, led to aggregate reductions in Medicare payments for all items and services, including prescription drugs and biologics, to service providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year beginning April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation, will continue until 2030 (with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021) unless Congress takes additional action. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 also, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained, including Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations.\nAdditional legislative changes, regulatory changes, or guidance could be adopted, which may impact the marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates. For example, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory, and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. There have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, evaluate the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government healthcare program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, on November 20, 2020, CMS\nissued an interim final rule to implement a \u201cMost Favored Nation\u201d demonstration project to test Medicare Part B reimbursement of certain separately payable drugs and biologicals based on international reference prices. The rule has become subject to judicial challenges, and federal courts have enjoined the rule at this time. If the rule survives judicial scrutiny, the Most Favored Nation model will subject certain drugs or biologicals identified by CMS as having the highest annual Medicare Part B spending to an alternative payment methodology based on international reference prices, with the list of products to be updated annually to add more products and products not to be removed absent limited circumstances. There has also been proposed legislation that would establish an international reference price-based Medicare Part B drug and biological payment methodology. If healthcare policies or reforms intended to curb healthcare costs are adopted or if we experience negative publicity with respect to pricing of our products or the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally, the prices that we charge for any approved products may be limited, our commercial opportunity may be limited and/or our revenues from sales of our products may be negatively impacted.\nIt is possible that the ACA, as currently enacted or may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, and new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted in the United States or outside of the United States, or whether regulatory changes, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be.\nIf we participate in the MDRP and fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under that or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we participate in the MDRP, we will have certain price reporting obligations to the MDRP, and we may have obligations to report ASP figures to the Medicare program. Under the MDRP, we would be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds available for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates would be based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data would include AMP and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. On December 21, 2020, CMS issued a final rule that modified MDRP regulations to permit reporting multiple best price figures with regard to value based purchasing arrangements (beginning in 2022); provide definitions of \u201cline extension,\u201d \u201cnew formulation,\u201d and related terms with the practical effect of expanding the scope of drugs considered to be line extensions (beginning in 2022); and revise best price and AMP exclusions of manufacturer-sponsored patient benefit programs, specifically regarding inapplicability of such exclusions in the context of pharmacy benefit manager \u201caccumulator\u201d programs (beginning in 2023).\nFederal law also requires that a company that participates in the MDRP report ASP information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program. Manufacturers calculate ASP based on a statutorily defined formula and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B.\nFederal law requires that any company that participates in the MDRP also participate in the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer\u2019s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs. HRSA, which administers the 340B program, issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. HRSA also has implemented a ceiling price reporting requirement, pursuant to which manufacturers must report the 340B ceiling prices for their covered outpatient drugs to HRSA on a quarterly basis. HRSA then publishes those prices to 340B covered entities. Moreover, under a final regulation effective January 13, 2021, HRSA newly established an administrative dispute resolution (\u201cADR\u201d) process for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer has engaged in overcharging, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. Such claims are to be resolved through an ADR panel of government officials rendering a decision that could be appealed only in federal court. An ADR proceeding could subject a manufacturer to onerous procedural requirements and could result in additional liability.\nIn addition, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, a manufacturer also must participate in the Department of\nVeterans Affairs FSS pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make its \u201ccovered drugs\u201d (biologics or innovator drugs) available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies - Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Public Health Service and Coast Guard - that is no higher than the statutory federal ceiling price. The requirements under the 340B and FSS programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount for each covered outpatient drug is computed each quarter based on the manufacturer\u2019s submission to CMS of its current AMP and, in the case of innovator products, best price figures, for the quarter. If we participate in the MDRP and become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed, we will be obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the MDRP. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we would be required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B program, and we may be obligated to issue refunds to covered entities.\nIf we participate in the MDRP or our products are covered under Medicare Part B, we will be liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. We cannot assure you that our submissions, if we participate in these programs, will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false AMP, ASP or best price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties per item of false information. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our ASP, the Medicare statute provides for civil monetary penalties for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Civil monetary penalties also can be applied if we are found to have intentionally charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP, ASP and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we would participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs that we are able to successfully commercialize.\nLaws and regulations governing any international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain products outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nIf we expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The FCPA prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-United States nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on United States exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nThe consequences of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nThe United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d)\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. The impact of Brexit on the on-going validity in the U.K. of current E.U. authorizations for medicinal products, whether granted through the centralized procedure, decentralized procedure, or mutual recognition, and on the future process for obtaining marketing authorization for pharmaceutical products manufactured or sold in the U.K. remains uncertain.\nOn December 24, 2020, the E.U. and U.K. reached an agreement in principle on the framework for their future relationship, the E.U.- U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This agreement primarily focuses on ensuring free trade between the E.U. and the U.K. in relation to goods, including medicinal products. Although the body of this agreement includes general terms which apply to medicinal products, greater detail on sector-specific issues is provided in an Annex to this agreement. The Annex provides a framework for the recognition of cGMP inspections and for the exchange and acceptance of official cGMP documents.\nThis agreement does not, however, extend to procedures such as batch release certification. Among the changes that will now occur are that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will be treated as a country outside and separate from the E.U. Northern Ireland will, with regard to E.U. regulations, continue to follow the E.U. regulatory rules. As part of this agreement, the E.U. and the U.K. will recognize cGMP inspections carried out by the other party and the acceptance of official cGMP documents issued by the other party. This agreement also encourages, although it does not oblige, the parties to consult one another on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures. Among the areas of absence of mutual recognition are batch testing and batch release.\nThe U.K. has unilaterally agreed to accept E.U. batch testing and batch release for a period of at least 2 years until January 1, 2023. However, the E.U. continues to apply E.U. laws that require batch testing and batch release to take place in the E.U. territory. This means that medicinal products that are tested and released in the U.K. must be retested and re-released when entering the E.U. market for commercial use. As regards marketing authorizations, Great Britain will have a separate regulatory submission process, approval process and a separate national marketing authorization. Northern Ireland will, however, continue to be covered by the marketing authorizations granted by the European Commission.\nThese developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could significantly increase the complexity of our activities in the E.U. and in the United Kingdom, could depress our economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our securities.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur significant costs.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nFurther, with respect to the operations of our third-party contract manufacturers, it is possible that if they fail to operate in compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or properly dispose of wastes associated with our products, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, suffer reputational harm or experience a disruption in the manufacture and supply of our product candidates or products.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct, including intentional failure to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable non-United States regulatory authorities, failure to provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable non-United States regulatory authorities, including the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, failure to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, failure to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable non-United States regulatory authorities, and failure to report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus could adversely impact our business.\nWe continue to monitor the effect of the novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19. The COVID-19 coronavirus has spread to multiple countries, including the United States, and has caused significant disruptions around the world. We may experience disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that could severely impact our business, including:\n\u2022difficulties in raising additional capital needed to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC due to the slowing of our economy and near term and/or long term negative effects of the pandemic on the financial, banking and capital markets;\n\u2022delays in necessary interactions with regulators and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources, travel restrictions or forced furlough of government employees;\n\u2022interruption of key business activities due to illness and/or quarantine of key individuals and delays associated with recruiting, hiring and training new temporary or permanent replacements for such key individuals, both internally and at our third party service providers;\n\u2022evolving changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 outbreak that may require us to change the ways in which operate, which may result in unexpected costs;\n\u2022interruption of key commercialization, manufacturing, and related activities due to limitations on work and travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others; and\n\u2022delays or difficulties related to any future clinical trials that may be required, including delays in clinical trial sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct clinical trials, difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff and difficulties in enrolling patients or treating patients in active trials.\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the virus. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and continuing restrictions on travel and transports, and shelter-in-place, social distancing, and similar measures, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. The broad-based business and economic disruptions caused by the pandemic could materially affect our business condition, results of operations and cash flows, including our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. The loss of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could compromise our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and\ncommercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had twenty-seven full-time employees and no part-time employees, eight hold Ph.D. degrees and one is a veterinary doctor. This number consists of eleven employees engaged in administration, five employees engaged in clinical and regulatory activities, five employees engaged in research and development, four employees engaged in operations (two in manufacturing and two in facility/engineering) and two employees engaged in quality and support. Three of our employees are located in our corporate headquarters in Boston, thirteen of our employees are located in our Winnipeg facility, and eleven of our employees are located in our Philadelphia office. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, or as a result of any future acquisitions, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Our management, personnel and systems that are currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022managing our clinical trials effectively;\n\u2022identifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees;\n\u2022managing our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n\u2022improving our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and\n\u2022expanding our facilities.\nAs our operations expand, we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, if approved, and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. To that end, we must be able to effectively manage our development efforts and clinical trials and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. Our failure to accomplish any of these tasks could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nIf we expand our development and regulatory capabilities or implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nTo manage future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted or managed by third parties, to collect, store, process and transmit electronic data. In addition, we handle certain data, including proprietary business information and personal information that is subject to data protection laws and regulations. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.\nAlthough we have implemented processes, procedures, and controls to help mitigate the risks associated with a cyber security incident, there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient for all possible situations. Even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to protect the networks, systems and information we maintain. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other\nforms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, ransomware, computer viruses or other malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted cyber security incidents evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, making it impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats and disruptions to our information technology infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, our product research, development and commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC could be delayed, or we could be subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions or incur liability, substantial fines or costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we maintain insurance coverage for various cyber security risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \"Certificate of Incorporation\") and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors such that only one of three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u2022allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from our board of directors;\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal specified provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\"), which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had United States federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards of $194.1 million, state NOL carryforwards of $134.4 million and United States federal and state research and development credit (\"R&D credit\") carryforwards of $2.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively. $118.9 million of the United States federal NOL carryforwards and $134.4 million of the state NOL carryforwards expire beginning 2030 through 2040. $75.2 million of the United States federal NOL carryforwards will be carried forward indefinitely. The United States federal and state R&D credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in 2027 through 2040, if not utilized. Utilization of these NOL and R&D credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code and comparable provisions of state, local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. Under Section 382 of the Code and comparable provisions of state, local and foreign tax laws, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three year period,\nthe corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, to reduce its post-change income may be limited. We have determined that it is more likely than not that our NOL and R&D credit carryforward amounts disclosed are subject to a material limitation under Section 382. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we generate taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL and R&D credit carryforwards to reduce United States federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us.", "PERMNO": 14452, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SESN"}
