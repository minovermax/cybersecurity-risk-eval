{"cik": "939767", "company": "EXELIXIS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or such other risks actually occur, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur ability to grow our company is critically dependent upon the commercial success of CABOMETYX in its approved indications and the further clinical development, regulatory approval and commercial success of cabozantinib in additional indications.\nOur mission is to maximize the clinical and commercial potential of cabozantinib, and to position us for future growth through our discovery efforts and expansion of our development pipeline. We anticipate that for the foreseeable future our ability to maintain or meaningfully increase unrestricted cash flow to fund our commercial operations and our development and discovery programs is dependent upon the continued successful commercialization of CABOMETYX for the treatment of RCC and HCC, in each case in territories where it has been approved and according to the terms of such regulatory approvals. The commercial opportunity for CABOMETYX as a treatment for RCC and HCC remains subject to a\nvariety of factors, most importantly, CABOMETYX\u2019s perceived benefit/risk profile as compared to the benefit/risk profiles of other treatments available or currently in development for these conditions. If revenue from CABOMETYX decreases or remains flat, or if we fail to achieve anticipated product royalties and collaboration milestones, we may need to reduce our operating expenses, access other sources of cash or otherwise modify our business plans, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, as a consequence of our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda, we rely heavily upon their regulatory, commercial, medical affairs, market access and other expertise and resources for commercialization of CABOMETYX in their respective territories outside of the U.S. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the commercialization of CABOMETYX, or to its marketing and distribution, and our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of CABOMETYX by our collaborators depends on their ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for, achieve market acceptance of, and to otherwise effectively market, CABOMETYX in its approved indications in their respective territories. Further, foreign sales of CABOMETYX by our collaborators could be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions or barriers and changes in tariffs, including as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) pending withdrawal from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), escalating global trade and political tensions, or otherwise. If our collaborators are unable to, or do not invest the resources necessary to successfully commercialize CABOMETYX in the EU and other international territories where it has been approved, this could reduce the amount of revenue we are due to receive under these collaboration agreements, thus resulting in harm to our business and operations.\nCABOMETYX has been approved for the treatment of advanced RCC in the U.S., the EU and other territories, and for the treatment of previously treated HCC in the U.S. and the EU. Following these approvals, our ability to grow our company remains contingent upon, among other things, further success in the clinical development, regulatory approval and market acceptance of cabozantinib, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in CABOMETYX, in potential additional indications. We cannot be certain that the clinical trials we and our collaboration partners are currently conducting, or may conduct in the future, will demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy in these additional indications to receive regulatory approval. Should we prove unsuccessful in advancing the further clinical development and commercialization of cabozantinib beyond its currently approved indications, we may be unable to execute our business plans, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we and our partners receive the required regulatory approvals to market cabozantinib for any additional indications or in additional territories, we and our partners may not be able to effectively commercialize CABOMETYX in these additional indications or territories.\nOur ability to grow revenues from sales of CABOMETYX will depend upon the degree of market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payers, and the medical community.\nOur ability to increase revenues from sales of CABOMETYX for its approved indications is, and if approved for additional indications will be, highly dependent upon the extent of market acceptance of CABOMETYX among physicians, patients, government health care payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health care plans and the medical community. If CABOMETYX does not continue to be prescribed broadly for the treatment of advanced RCC and achieve market acceptance for the treatment of previously treated HCC, we may not be able to grow product revenues. The degree of market acceptance of CABOMETYX will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness, of CABOMETYX in comparison to competing products;\n\u2022\nthe safety of CABOMETYX, including the existence of serious side effects of CABOMETYX and their severity in comparison to those of competing products;\n\u2022\nCABOMETYX\u2019s relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\npotential unexpected results connected with analysis of data from future or ongoing clinical trials of cabozantinib;\n\u2022\nthe timing of CABOMETYX label expansions for additional indications, if any, relative to competitive treatments;\n\u2022\nthe price of CABOMETYX relative to competitive therapies;\n\u2022\nprice increases taken by us and the impact on the net sales price of CABOMETYX as a result of any new laws, regulations or other government initiatives affecting pharmaceutical pricing;\n\u2022\nthe strength of CABOMETYX sales efforts, marketing, market access and product distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe sufficiency of commercial and government health insurance coverage and adequacy of reimbursement for CABOMETYX; and\n\u2022\nour ability to enforce our intellectual property rights with respect to CABOMETYX.\nFurther, in the event that any of these or other factors cause market acceptance of CABOMETYX to decrease, this could negatively impact our revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur competitors may develop products and technologies that impair the relative value of our marketed products and any future product candidates.\nThe pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are competitive, highly diversified and are characterized by rapid technological change, particularly in the area of novel oncology therapies. Many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources, larger research and development staff and facilities, more experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and more extensive product manufacturing and commercial capabilities than we do, which may allow them to have a competitive advantage. Further, our competitors may be more effective at using their technologies to develop commercial products. As a result, our competitors may be able to more easily develop products that would render our products, and those of our collaborators, obsolete and noncompetitive. There may also be drug candidates that we are not aware of at an earlier stage of development that may compete with our marketed products and product candidates. We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities similar to ours. Delays in the development of cabozantinib for the treatment of additional tumor types, for example, could allow our competitors to bring products to market before us.\nSpecifically, the indications for which CABOMETYX is approved are highly competitive. Several novel therapies and combinations of therapies have been approved, are in advanced stages of clinical development or are under expedited regulatory review in these indications, and these other therapies are currently competing or are expected to compete with CABOMETYX. We believe our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances and the shifting landscape of therapeutic strategy following the advent of immunotherapy. While we have adapted our development strategy for cabozantinib to address the fact that this approach to treating cancer with ICIs in combination with other therapeutic agents has become highly prevalent in indications for which our products are approved, we cannot ensure that our clinical trials will show efficacy in comparison to competing products or product combinations. Furthermore, the complexities of such a development strategy has and may continue to require collaboration with some of our competitors.\nWe also may face competition from manufacturers of generic versions of our marketed products, and both Congress and the FDA are seeking to promote generic competition, including through proposals that may limit or reduce the term for patent exclusivity or regulatory exclusivity for branded products. Such generic competition often results in very significant decreases in the overall sales or prices at which branded products can be sold.\nIf we are unable to maintain or scale adequate sales, marketing, market access and product distribution capabilities for our products or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to do so, we may be unable to maximize product revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaintaining our sales, marketing, market access and product distribution capabilities requires significant resources, and there are numerous risks involved with managing such a commercial organization, including our potential inability to successfully recruit, train, retain and incentivize adequate numbers of qualified and effective sales and marketing personnel. We are competing for talent with numerous commercial-stage oncology-focused biotech companies seeking to build out their commercial organizations, as well as other large pharmaceutical organizations that have extensive, well-funded, and more experienced sales and marketing operations, and we may be unable to maintain or adequately scale our commercial organization as a result of such competition. If we cannot maintain effective sales, marketing, market access and product distribution capabilities, we may be unable to maximize the commercial potential of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in their approved indications. Also, to the extent that the commercial opportunities for CABOMETYX grow over time, we may not properly judge the requisite size and experience of our current commercialization teams or the level of distribution necessary to market and sell CABOMETYX successfully in multiple indications. If we are unable to maintain or scale our organization appropriately, we may not be able to maximize product revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which we are able to adequately distribute the products to eligible patients. We currently rely on third-party providers to handle storage and distribution for our commercial supplies of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S. Furthermore, we rely on our\ncollaboration partners for ongoing and further commercialization and distribution of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in their respective territories outside of the U.S., as well as for access and distribution activities for the approved products under named patient use programs (or similar programs) with the effect of introducing earlier patient access to CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon the activities, support, and legal and regulatory compliance of third parties may adversely affect our ability to supply CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ to the marketplace on a timely and competitive basis. These third parties may not provide services in the time required to meet our commercial timelines and objectives or to meet regulatory requirements. We may not be able to maintain or renew our arrangements with third parties, or enter into new arrangements, on acceptable terms, or at all. Third parties could terminate or decline to renew our arrangements based on their own business priorities. If we are unable to contract for these third-party services related to the distribution of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ on acceptable terms, our commercialization efforts and those of our collaboration partners may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain or obtain for our products both sufficient health insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, our business will suffer.\nOur ability to commercialize our products successfully is highly dependent on the extent to which health insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement is, and will be, available from third-party payers, including governmental payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers. Patients may not be capable of paying for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ themselves and may rely on third-party payers to pay for, or subsidize, the costs of their medications, among other medical costs. If third-party payers do not provide coverage or adequate reimbursement for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ, our revenues and results of operations will suffer. In addition, even if third-party payers provide some coverage or reimbursement for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ, the availability of such coverage or reimbursement for prescription drugs under private health insurance and managed care plans, which often varies based on the type of contract or plan purchased, may not be sufficient for patients to afford CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ. Third-party payers continue to scrutinize and manage the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services, and many also limit reimbursement for newly-approved products and indications.\nWe are subject to certain healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement; our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain healthcare laws and regulations and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Should our compliance controls prove ineffective at preventing or mitigating the risk and impact of improper conduct or inaccurate reporting, the laws that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), which governs our business activities, including our marketing practices, medical educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities. The AKS has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others. Among other things, this statute prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration is not defined in the AKS and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, coupons, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests, value-added services to customers, and providing anything at less than its fair market value;\n\u2022\nthe FDCA and its implementing regulations, which prohibit, among other things, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any drug that is adulterated or misbranded;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA and its implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on covered entities and business associates that access such information on behalf of a covered entity;\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts;\n\u2022\nthe PPACA Open Payments program created under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the government information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u2022\nstate laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities, as well as state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives;\n\u2022\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law which regulates certain financial relationships with foreign government officials (which could include, for example, certain medical professionals) and its foreign equivalents;\n\u2022\nfederal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and\n\u2022\nfederal, state and municipal pharmaceutical price and price reporting laws, both existing (e.g., California\u2019s SB-17) and under consideration, which require or propose to require us to provide notice of price increases and/or file complex ancillary reports concerning prices and pricing and discount practices. The legal and regulatory landscape, and associated compliance obligations imposed on pharmaceutical companies, may increase general and administrative costs, cause revenue fluctuations due to speculative buying practices by purchasers, or diminish our revenues as a result of the imposition of caps on pricing and price increases.\nThese federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, FDA rules and regulations, as well as false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, govern certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we, or our officers or employees, may be subject to penalties, including administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, regulatory penalties, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, reputational harm, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, any of which would adversely affect our ability to sell our products and operate our business and also adversely affect our financial results. Of particular concern are suits filed under the civil False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, which can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These individuals, commonly known as relators or \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may potentially then share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The filing of qui tam actions has caused a number of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies to have to defend civil False Claims Act actions. When an entity is determined to have violated the civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nCurrent healthcare laws and regulations and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the healthcare system may affect our ability to commercialize our marketed products profitably.\nThe U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to continue to commercialize CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nSpecifically, we may face uncertainties as a result of executive, legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the Texas District Court Judge, as well as the Trump Administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending an appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA. There is no assurance that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. The Trump Administration has also indicated an intention to regulate prescription drug pricing, and recent Congressional hearings have brought increased public attention to the costs of prescription drugs. These actions and the uncertainty about the future of the PPACA and healthcare laws may put downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nIn August 2017, President Trump signed the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, which will reauthorize the FDA user fee programs for prescription drugs, generic drugs, medical devices, and biosimilars, under which manufacturers of such products partially pay for the FDA\u2019s pre-market review of their product candidates. The legislation includes, inter alia, measures to expedite the development and approval of generic products, where generic competition is lacking even in the absence of exclusivities or listed patents. The FDA has also released a Drug Competition Action Plan, which proposes actions to broaden access to generic drugs and lower consumers\u2019 health care costs by, among other things, improving the efficiency of the generic drug approval process and supporting the development of complex generic drugs, and the FDA has taken steps to implement this plan. Moreover, both Congress and the FDA are considering various legislative and regulatory proposals that would limit or reduce the term for patent exclusivity or regulatory exclusivity in the biopharmaceutical industry. While we cannot currently predict the specific outcome or impact on our business of such regulatory actions or legislation, they do have the potential to facilitate the development and future approval of generic versions of our products or otherwise limit or reduce the term for our market exclusivity, which could result in very significant decreases in the overall sales or prices of our marketed products and materially harm our business and financial condition.\nAs a result of the overall trend towards cost-effectiveness criteria and managed healthcare in the U.S., third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. Insurers also continue to pursue means of contracting for pharmaceutical \u201cvalue\u201d or \u201coutcomes.\u201d These entities could refuse or limit coverage for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, such as by using tiered reimbursement or pressing for new forms of value-based contracting, which would adversely affect demand for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ. They may also refuse to provide coverage for uses of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approval. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payers will cover newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, third-party payer or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures. These policy actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPricing for pharmaceutical products has come under increasing scrutiny by governments, legislative bodies and enforcement agencies. These activities may result in actions that have the effect of reducing our revenue or harming our business or reputation.\nMany companies in our industry have received a governmental request for documents and information relating to drug pricing and patient support programs. Requests could originate in various forms, including through a Congressional inquiry (e.g., from the U.S. Senate Finance Committee) or a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice. We could receive a similar request, which would require us to incur significant expense and result in distraction for our management team. Additionally, to the extent there are findings, or even allegations, of improper conduct on the part of the company, these findings could further harm our business, reputation and/or prospects. It is possible that these inquiries could result in: negative publicity or other negative actions that could harm our reputation; changes in our product pricing and distribution strategies; reduced demand for our approved products; and/or reduced reimbursement of approved products, including by federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and state health care programs.\nSpecifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing (including requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturers to report price increases and provide a public justification for these increases if they exceed certain benchmarks), review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the price of drugs\nunder Medicare, reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs, and facilitate value-based arrangements between manufacturers and payers. Also, the Trump Administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, both Congress and the Trump Administration have indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, in October 2018, CMS proposed a rule that would require drug manufacturers to disclose drug prices in television advertisements, and in November 2018, CMS proposed a rule that would allow Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans to limit coverage under certain defined circumstances for certain drugs, including cancer medicines, pursuant to exceptions to the existing \u201cprotected classes\u201d policy. In addition, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General has solicited input for proposed rulemaking related to the potential addition of \u201csafe harbor\u201d regulations for the AKS. This solicitation aims, among other things, at changes to pharmaceutical contracting and discounting (including potentially encouraging value-based contracting). We cannot know what form any final regulations promulgated by CMS or the HHS Office of Inspector General might look like or how they could affect our business.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing, including the National Medicaid Pooling Initiative. With respect to drug pricing transparency, for example, in October 2017, California Governor Jerry Brown signed SB-17, which requires, among other provisions, pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide notice of price increases above a defined threshold to certain purchasers and related reports to the government. SB-17 is currently subject to challenge, but in the meantime, manufacturers must comply with its requirements. We do not know what form legislative proposals concerning drug prices may take in other states or how they would affect us. It is possible that these laws would encourage federal and state healthcare programs to reduce the amount of reimbursements they provide for prescription drugs, and any reduction in reimbursement from these government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. We also believe that pricing transparency requirements, such as the requirement for us, in certain circumstances, to provide lengthy notices of price increases to purchasers, may influence customer ordering patterns for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, and that this, in turn, may increase the volatility of our revenues as a reflection of changes in inventory volumes. Therefore, the implementation of these cost cost-containment measures or other healthcare reforms may result in fluctuations in our results of operations and limit our ability to generate product revenue or commercialize our current products and/or those for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future.\nFurther, in some foreign countries, particularly in the EU, the pricing and reimbursement of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control under the respective national health system. In these EU countries, pricing and reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities or payers can take six to twelve months or longer after the initial marketing authorization is granted for a product, or after the marketing authorization for a new indication is granted. This can substantially delay broad availability of the product. To obtain reimbursement and/or pricing approval in some countries, our collaboration partner, Ipsen, may be required to conduct a study that seeks to establish the cost effectiveness of CABOMETYX compared with other available established therapies. The conduct of such a study could also result in delays in the commercialization of CABOMETYX. Additionally, cost-control initiatives, increasingly based on affordability, could decrease the price we and our collaboration partner, Ipsen, might establish for CABOMETYX, which would result in lower license revenues to us.\nEnhanced governmental and private scrutiny over, or investigations or litigation involving, pharmaceutical manufacturer donations to patient assistance programs offered by charitable foundations may require us to modify our programs and could negatively impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the attention of management and increase our expenses.\nTo help patients afford our products, we have a patient assistance program and also occasionally make donations to independent charitable foundations that help financially needy patients. These types of programs designed to assist patients in affording pharmaceuticals have become the subject of scrutiny. In recent years, some pharmaceutical manufacturers were named in class action lawsuits challenging the legality of their patient assistance programs and support of independent charitable patient support foundations under a variety of federal and state laws. Our patient assistance program and support of independent charitable foundations could become the target of similar litigation. At least one insurer also has directed its network pharmacies to no longer accept manufacturer co-payment coupons for certain\nspecialty drugs the insurer identified. In addition, certain state and federal enforcement authorities and members of Congress have initiated inquiries about co-pay assistance programs. Some state legislatures have also been considering proposals that would restrict or ban co-pay coupons.\nIn addition, there has been regulatory review and enhanced government scrutiny of donations by pharmaceutical companies to patient assistance programs operated by charitable foundations. The HHS Office of Inspector General has established specific guidelines permitting pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations who provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a donor\u2019s product. If we are deemed not to have complied with laws or regulations in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to damages, fines, penalties or other criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions. Further, numerous organizations, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, have received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice and other enforcement authorities seeking information related to their patient assistance programs and support, and certain of these organizations have entered into, or have otherwise agreed to, significant civil settlements with applicable enforcement authorities. In connection with these civil settlements, the U.S. government has and may in the future require the affected companies to enter into complex corporate integrity agreements that impose significant reporting and other requirements on those companies. We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will be sufficient to protect against acts of our employees, business partners or vendors that may violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Regardless of whether we have complied with the law, a government investigation could negatively impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the attention of management and increase our expenses.\nWe are subject to government regulations relating to privacy and data protection that have required us to modify certain of our policies and procedures with respect to the collection and processing of personal data, and future regulations may cause us to incur additional expenses or otherwise limit our ability to collect and process personal data. Failure to maintain compliance with these regulations could jeopardize certain business transactions and create additional liabilities for us.\nThe legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection in the U.S. continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, that govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. For example, in June 2018, California Governor Jerry Brown signed the CCPA, which takes effect on January 1, 2020 and will broadly define personal information, give California residents expanded privacy rights and protections and provide for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. There are similar legislative proposals being advanced in other states, as well as in Congress. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products, and from whom we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. For example, the EU Data Privacy Directive (95/46/EC) and implementing legislation in the various national Member States of the EU was replaced on May 25, 2018 by the more restrictive GDPR, which now regulates the processing of personal data within the EU and between countries in the EU and countries outside of the EU, including the U.S. Switzerland is updating the Swiss Data Protection Act, and updates to data protection laws in other countries may occur in due course. In connection with these new laws, in particular the CCPA and GDPR, we have modified certain of our policies and procedures with respect to the collection and processing of personal data to the extent necessary given our operations and commensurate with similar companies in our industry. We will continue to review all future privacy and other regulations implemented pursuant to the CCPA, GDPR and other applicable laws to assess whether additional procedural safeguards are warranted, which may cause us to incur additional expenses or otherwise limit our ability to collect and process personal data. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with these laws and regulations could jeopardize certain domestic and cross-border business transactions and create additional liabilities for us, including the imposition of sanctions or other penalties, as well as increase our cost of doing business.\nIf competitors use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic versions of our marketed products, our business will suffer.\nUnder the FDCA, the FDA can approve an ANDA for a generic version of a branded drug without the applicant undertaking the human clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. The FDA can also approve a\n505(b)(2) NDA that relies in whole or in part on the agency\u2019s findings of safety and/or effectiveness for a previously approved drug. Both the ANDA and 505(b)(2) processes are discussed in more detail above in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d under the heading \"Government Regulation-The Hatch-Waxman Act.\u201d In either case, if an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant submits an application referencing one of our drugs prior to the expiry of one or more listed patents for the drug, we may end up engaging in litigation with the potential generic competitor to protect our patent rights, which would require us to incur significant expense and result in distraction for our management team, and could also have an adverse impact on our stock price. Moreover, if any such ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs were to be approved, and if our listed patents covering cabozantinib were held to be invalid (or if any such competing generic versions of cabozantinib were found not to infringe our patents), we would have generic competitors in the market, and the resulting generic competition would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, generic cabozantinib products would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market. Companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, regardless of the regulatory approval pathway, the introduction of a generic version of any of our marketed products could result in very significant decreases in the overall sales or prices of these marketed products and materially harm our business and financial condition.\nClinical testing of cabozantinib for new indications, or of new potential product candidates, is a lengthy, costly, complex and uncertain process and may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy.\nClinical trials are inherently risky and may reveal that cabozantinib, despite its approval for certain indications, or a new potential product candidate, is ineffective or has an unacceptable safety profile with respect to an intended use. Such results may significantly decrease the likelihood of regulatory approval in a particular indication. Moreover, the results of preliminary studies do not necessarily predict clinical or commercial success, and later stage clinical trials may fail to confirm the results observed in earlier stage trials or preliminary studies. Although we have established timelines for manufacturing and clinical development of cabozantinib and our other product candidates based on existing knowledge of our compounds in development and industry metrics, we may not be able to meet those timelines.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events, during or as a result of clinical testing, that could delay or prevent commercialization of cabozantinib in new indications, or of our other product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nlack of efficacy or a tolerable safety profile;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive clinical trial results may require us to conduct further testing or to abandon projects that we had expected to be promising;\n\u2022\ndiscovery or commercialization by our competitors of other compounds or therapies that show significantly improved safety or efficacy compared to cabozantinib or our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nour inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs;\n\u2022\nlower-than-anticipated patient registration or enrollment in our clinical testing, resulting in the delay or cancellation of clinical testing;\n\u2022\nfailure by our collaborators to provide us on a timely basis with an adequate supply of product that complies with the applicable quality and regulatory requirements for a combination trial;\n\u2022\nfailure of our third-party contract research organizations or investigators to satisfy their contractual obligations, including deviating from any trial protocols; and\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may withhold authorization to commence or conduct clinical trials of cabozantinib or another product candidate, or delay, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their determination that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks.\nIf we were to have significant delays in or termination of the clinical testing of cabozantinib or our other product candidates as a result of any of the events described above or otherwise, our expenses could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be impaired, either of which could adversely impact our financial results. Furthermore, we rely on our clinical and commercial collaboration partners to fund a significant portion of the clinical development of cabozantinib and our product candidates. Should one or all of our collaboration partners decline to support future planned clinical trials, we will be entirely responsible for the financial obligations associated with the further development of cabozantinib or our other product candidates and, as a result, we may be unable to execute our business plans, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to rapidly or effectively continue the further development of cabozantinib or our other product candidates or meet current or future requirements of the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including those identified based on our discussions with the FDA or such other regulatory authorities. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, or at all, may not be completed on schedule, or at all, may not be sufficient for registration of our product candidates or may not result in an approvable product.\nThe duration and the cost of clinical trials vary significantly as a result of factors relating to the clinical trial, including, among others:\n\u2022\ncharacteristics of the product candidate under investigation;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients who ultimately participate in the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe duration of patient follow-up that is appropriate in view of the results or required by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe number of clinical sites included in the trials; and\n\u2022\nthe length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects.\nAny delay could limit our ability to generate revenues, cause us to incur additional expense and cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. Our partners under our collaboration agreements may experience similar risks with respect to the compounds we have out-licensed to them. If any of the events described above were to occur with such programs or compounds, the likelihood of receipt of milestones and royalties under such collaboration agreements could decrease.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy and uncertain, and may not result in regulatory approvals for cabozantinib or our other product candidates, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe activities associated with the research, development and commercialization of cabozantinib and our other product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and by comparable authorities in other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions is expensive, and often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. For example, before an NDA or sNDA can be submitted to the FDA, or a MAA to the EMA or any application or submission to regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, the product candidate must undergo extensive clinical trials, which can take many years and require substantial expenditures.\nAny clinical trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. For example, the FDA could determine that the design of a clinical trial is inadequate to produce reliable results. The regulatory process also requires preclinical testing, and data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to approve any NDA or decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. For example, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of cabozantinib for any individual, additional indications.\nIn addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review, which may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application for cabozantinib or for our other product candidates.\nEven if the FDA or a comparable authority in another jurisdiction approves cabozantinib for one or more indications beyond advanced RCC, previously treated HCC and MTC, or one of our other product candidates, the approval may be limited, imposing significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, distribution, advertising, promotion, marketing and/or production of the product and could impose ongoing requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. For example, in connection with the FDA\u2019s approval of COMETRIQ for the treatment of progressive, metastatic MTC, we are subject to a post-marketing requirement to conduct a clinical study comparing a lower dose of cabozantinib to the approved dose of 140 mg daily cabozantinib in progressive, metastatic MTC. Failure to complete any post-marketing requirements in accordance with the timelines and conditions set forth by the FDA could significantly increase costs or delay, limit or eliminate the commercialization of cabozantinib. Further, these agencies may also impose various administrative, civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval.\nWe may be unable to expand our development pipeline, which could limit our growth and revenue potential.\nOur business is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines for difficult-to-treat cancers. In this regard, we are pursuing internal drug discovery efforts with the goal of identifying new product candidates to advance into clinical trials. Internal discovery efforts to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. These internal discovery efforts may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet ultimately fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons. For example, potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have inadequate efficacy, harmful side effects, suboptimal pharmaceutical profiles or other characteristics suggesting that they are unlikely to be commercially viable products.\nApart from our internal discovery efforts, our strategy to expand our development pipeline is also dependent on our ability to successfully identify and acquire or in-license relevant product candidates. However, the in-licensing and acquisition of product candidates is a highly competitive area, and many other companies are pursuing the same or similar product candidates to those that we may consider attractive. In particular, larger companies with more well-established and diverse revenue streams may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, financial resources and more extensive clinical development and commercialization capabilities. Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We may also be unable to in-license or acquire additional relevant product candidates on acceptable terms that would allow us to realize an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to develop suitable product candidates through internal discovery effort or if we are unable to successfully obtain rights to suitable product candidates, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer. Even if we succeed in our efforts to obtain rights to suitable product candidates, the competitive business environment may result in higher acquisition or licensing costs, and our investment in these potential products will remain subject to the inherent risks associated with the development and commercialization of new medicines. In certain circumstances, we may also be reliant on the licensor for the continued development of the in-licensed technology and their efforts to safeguard their underlying intellectual property.\nWith respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate the target company successfully into our existing business, maintain the key business relationships of the target, or retain key personnel of an acquired business. Furthermore, we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or incur unanticipated expenses. Any acquisitions or investments made by us also could result in our spending significant amounts, issuing dilutive securities, assuming or incurring significant debt obligations and contingent liabilities, incurring large one-time expenses and acquiring intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense and significant write-offs, any of which could harm our operating results.\nIncreasing use of social media could give rise to liability and result in harm to our business.\nWe and our employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools and our website as a means of communication. For example, we use Facebook and Twitter to communicate with the medical community and the investing public, although we do not intend to disclose material, nonpublic information through these means. Despite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules, there is risk that the unauthorized use of social media by us or our employees to communicate about our products or business, or inadvertent disclosure of material, nonpublic information through these means, may cause us to be found in violation of applicable laws and regulations, which may give rise to liability and result in harm to our business. In addition, there is also risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, negative posts or comments about us or our products in social media could seriously damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Requirements, Accounting and Financial Results\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase profitability.\nAlthough we reported net income of $690.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, and we are unable to predict the extent of long-range future profits or losses. The amount of our net profits or losses will depend, in part, on: the level of sales of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S.; achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, if any, under our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda; the amount of royalties from sales of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ outside of the U.S. under our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda; other collaboration revenues; and the level of our expenses,\nincluding development and commercialization activities for cabozantinib and any pipeline expansion efforts. We expect to continue to spend significant additional amounts to fund the continued development of cabozantinib for additional indications and the commercialization of our approved products. In addition, we will continue to expand our product pipeline through our drug discovery efforts and the execution of strategic transactions that align with our oncology drug development expertise, which efforts could involve substantial costs. To offset these costs, we will need to generate substantial revenues. If these costs exceed our expectations, or we fail to achieve anticipated revenue targets, the market value of our common stock may decline.\nIf additional capital is not available to us when we need it, we may be forced to limit the expansion of our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $851.6 million in cash and investments, which included $850.5 million available for operations. Our business operations continued to grow substantially during 2018. In order to maintain business growth and maximize the clinical and commercial opportunities for cabozantinib, we plan to continue to execute on the U.S. commercialization plans for CABOMETYX, while reinvesting in our product pipeline through the continued development of cabozantinib, both alone and in combination with other therapies, research and development activities, as well as through strategic transactions. Our ability to execute on these business objectives will depend on many factors including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ and the revenues we generate from those approved products;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with maintaining our expanded sales, marketing, market access, medical affairs and product distribution capabilities for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ;\n\u2022\nthe achievement of stated regulatory and commercial milestones and royalties paid under our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda;\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of and revenues generated by products marketed under our collaboration and license agreements;\n\u2022\nfuture clinical trial results;\n\u2022\nthe level of our investments in the expansion of our pipeline through drug discovery and corporate development activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs;\n\u2022\nthe number and size of clinical trials we conduct and the cost of drug supply for such clinical trials evaluating our products with other therapeutic agents;\n\u2022\ntrends and developments in the pricing of oncologic therapeutics in the U.S. and abroad, especially in the EU;\n\u2022\nscientific developments in the market for oncologic therapeutics and the timing of regulatory approvals for competing oncologic therapies; and\n\u2022\nthe filing, maintenance, prosecution, defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\nOur commitment of cash resources to CABOMETYX and the reinvestment in our product pipeline through the continued development of cabozantinib and increasing drug discovery activities, as well as through the execution of strategic transactions, could require us to obtain additional capital. We may seek such additional capital through some or all of the following methods: corporate collaborations; licensing arrangements; and public or private debt or equity financings. Our ability to obtain additional capital may depend on prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets, including any disruptions resulting from government shutdowns, the UK\u2019s pending withdrawal from the EU, rising interest rate environments, increased or changed tariffs and trade restrictions or otherwise, may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit, as well as our ability to raise money in the capital markets. Economic and capital markets conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile. Continued instability in these market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to fund and grow our business. Accordingly, we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain additional capital on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, we may be required to limit the expansion of our product development programs or commercialization efforts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results are impacted by management\u2019s selection of accounting methods, certain assumptions and estimates and future changes in accounting standards.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. We believe our critical accounting policies relating to revenue recognition, clinical trial accruals, inventory and stock-based compensation reflect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, our interpretation of existing accounting literature and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, if our assumptions prove to be materially incorrect, actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nIn addition, future changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse, unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our financial position or results of operations, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenues and costs. New pronouncements from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency in the past and are expected to occur again in the future and as a result, we may be required to make changes in our accounting policies. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues and expenses, our other results of operations or our current financial position.\nThe recently passed comprehensive tax reform bill could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could be amended or subject to technical correction, which could change the financial impacts that were recorded at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, or are expected to be recorded in future periods. Additionally, further guidance may be forthcoming from the FASB and SEC, as well as regulations, interpretations and rulings from federal and state tax agencies, which could result in additional impacts, possibly with retroactive effect.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nWe are subject to income tax in the U.S. as well as numerous U.S. states and territories, municipalities, and other local jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from various factors including the mix of earnings and applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate, the accounting for stock options and share based awards, and research and development spending. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate, however, may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws such as the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, changes in the mix of our earnings from state to state, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, or our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities. Any of these factors could cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2028 for federal income tax purposes and 2028 for California state income tax purposes. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) and similar state provisions, certain substantial changes in our ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credit carryforwards before utilization. Based on our review and analysis, we concluded, as of December 31, 2018, that an ownership change, as defined under Section 382, had not occurred. However, if there is an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code in the future, we may not be able to utilize a\nmaterial portion of our net operating losses. Furthermore, our ability to utilize our net operating losses is conditioned upon our maintaining profitability and generating U.S. federal taxable income.\nThe transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) could affect the value of certain short-term investments, as well as our ability to seek additional debt financing.\nActions by governmental entities may impact certain financial instruments in which we have invested or may invest in the future. For example, some of these financial instruments may rely in some fashion upon LIBOR, which is an average interest rate, determined by the ICE Benchmark Administration, that banks charge one another for the use of short-term money. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced plans to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. While only a small percentage of our short-term investments include financial instruments subject to LIBOR, and while we do not currently have any outstanding debt that is subject to LIBOR, there remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate, and any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on certain instruments in to which we may enter in the future are not known. The transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR. The transition may also result in reductions in the value of certain instruments or the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, increased borrowing costs, uncertainty under applicable documentation, or difficult and costly consent processes. Any such effects of the transition away from LIBOR, as well as other unforeseen effects, result in expenses, difficulties, complications or delays in connection with future financing efforts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe UK\u2019s pending withdrawal from the EU may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nBrexit has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. While discussions between the UK and the EU focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements are ongoing, limited progress to date in these negotiations and ongoing uncertainty within the UK government and parliament sustains the possibility of the UK leaving the EU on March 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the UK makes to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the UK and the EU, undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the UK and the EU. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or adopt.\nGiven the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the EU would have and how such withdrawal would affect us. For example, we rely on third-party contract manufacturing organization facilities located in the UK, which are responsible for packaging, labeling, storing and subsequently distributing supplies of our product to the EU, and any tariffs, differing regulatory requirements and other restrictions on the free movement of goods between the UK and the EU that result from Brexit may have an adverse impact on this part of our supply chain. In addition, trade restrictions, changes to the regulatory approval or drug cost reimbursement systems, and additional administrative costs may impede the ability of our collaborator Ipsen to market our products in Europe. Furthermore, the announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations, and the pending withdrawal of the UK from the EU may also adversely affect European and global economic and market conditions, which may cause third-party payers, including governmental organizations, to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets, and which could contribute to instability in the global financial and foreign exchange markets. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Third Parties\nWe are dependent upon our collaborations with major companies, which subject us to a number of risks.\nWe have established collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including, Ipsen, Takeda, Genentech, Daiichi Sankyo and BMS for the development and ultimate commercialization of certain compounds generated from our research and development efforts. Our dependence on our relationships with collaborators for the development and commercialization of compounds subjects us to, a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators or potential future collaborators will devote to the development or commercialization of drug candidates or to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that collaborators may delay clinical trials, fail to supply us on a timely basis with the product required for a combination trial, deliver product that fails to meet appropriate quality and regulatory standards and results in a market recall or withdrawal, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a drug candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a drug candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ndisputes that may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our drug candidates, or that diminish or delay receipt of the economic benefits we are entitled to receive under the collaboration, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\nour inability to control the U.S. commercial resourcing decisions made and resulting costs incurred by Genentech for COTELLIC, which costs we are obligated to share, in part, under our collaboration agreement with Genentech;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that our collaborators may experience financial difficulties;\n\u2022\nour collaborators\u2019 lack of success in their efforts to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nour collaborators\u2019 failure to properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or their use of our intellectual property rights or proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\nour collaborators\u2019 failure to comply with the terms of our collaboration agreements and related ancillary agreements;\n\u2022\nour collaborators\u2019 failure to comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as established guidelines, laws and regulations related to GMP, GCP, GDP and Good Pharmacovigilance Practices;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator\u2019s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that our collaborators could independently move forward with competing drug candidates developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors;\n\u2022\nour inability to enter into additional collaboration arrangements with other parties in an area or field of exclusivity;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that future collaborators may require us to relinquish some important rights, such as marketing and distribution rights; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that collaborations may be terminated or allowed to expire, which would delay, and may increase the cost of development of our drug candidates.\nIf any of these risks materialize, we may not receive collaboration revenues or otherwise realize anticipated benefits from such collaborations, our product development efforts could be delayed, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf third parties upon which we rely to perform clinical trials for cabozantinib in new indications or for new potential product candidates do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize cabozantinib or other product candidates beyond currently approved indications.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct clinical trials for cabozantinib or for new potential product candidates independently, including our post-marketing commitments in connection with the approval of COMETRIQ in progressive,\nmetastatic MTC, so we rely on independent third parties for the performance of these trials, such as the U.S. federal government (including NCI-CTEP, a department of the National Institutes of Health, with whom we have our CRADA), third-party contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the third parties must be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they generate or provide is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize cabozantinib or other product candidates beyond currently approved indications. In addition, due to the complexity of our research initiatives, we may be unable to engage with third-party contract research organizations that have the necessary experience and sophistication to further our drug discovery efforts, which would impede our ability to identify, develop and commercialize our potential product candidates.\nWe lack internal manufacturing capabilities necessary for us to produce our products for clinical development or for commercial sale and rely on third parties to do so, which subjects us to various risks.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or resources for clinical or commercial production and distribution of our products. Instead, we have multiple contractual agreements in place with third-party contract manufacturing organizations that, on our behalf, manufacture clinical and commercial supplies of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ. As our operations expand due to our development and commercial progress, we expect to enter into new agreements with additional third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers as needed. This will continue for the foreseeable future for all of our product candidates and all of our current and future commercial products.\nTo establish and manage our supply chain requires a significant financial commitment, the creation of numerous third-party contractual relationships and continued oversight of these third parties to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Although we maintain significant resources to directly and effectively oversee the activities and relationships with the companies in our supply chain, we do not have direct control over their operations.\nOur third-party contract manufacturers may not be able to produce material on a timely basis or manufacture material with the required quality standards, or in the quantity required to meet our development and commercial needs and applicable regulatory requirements. If our third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers do not continue to supply us with our products or product candidates in a timely fashion and in compliance with applicable quality and regulatory requirements, or if they otherwise fail or refuse to comply with their obligations to us under our supply and manufacturing arrangements, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Furthermore, their failure to supply us could impair or preclude our ability to meet our commercial supply requirements, or our supply needs for clinical trials, including those being conducted in collaboration with our partners, which could delay our product development efforts and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Through our third-party contract manufacturers and data service providers, we have implemented product serialization designed to comply with the DSCSA, pursuant to which all prescription pharmaceutical products manufactured and distributed in the U.S. were required to be serialized as of November 27, 2018. If our third-party contract manufacturers or data service providers fail to support our efforts to continue to comply with DSCSA and any future federal or state electronic pedigree requirements, we may face legal penalties or be restricted from selling our products.\nAs part of our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda, we are responsible for the supply of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ for global development and commercial purposes. Failure to meet our supply obligations under these collaboration agreements could impair our collaborators\u2019 ability to successfully develop and commercialize CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ and generate revenues to which we are entitled under the collaborations.\nOur collaborations with outside scientific advisors and collaborators may be subject to restriction and change.\nWe work with scientific and clinical advisors and collaborators at academic and other institutions that assist us in our research and development efforts, including in drug discovery and preclinical development strategy. These advisors and collaborators are not our employees and may have other commitments or pursue other opportunities that limit their availability to us. Although these advisors and collaborators generally agree not to do competing work, if a conflict of interest between their work for us and their work for another entity arises, we may lose their services. There has also been increased scrutiny surrounding the disclosures of payments made to medical researchers from companies in the pharmaceutical industry, and it is possible that the academic and other institutions that employ these medical researchers may prevent us from engaging them as advisors and collaborators or otherwise limit our access to these experts, or that the advisors themselves may now be more reluctant to work with industry partners. In any of these circumstances, we may lose\nwork performed by these advisors and collaborators or be unable to engage them in the first place, and our discovery and development efforts with respect to the matters on which they were working or would work in the future may be significantly delayed or otherwise adversely affected. In addition, although our advisors and collaborators sign agreements not to disclose our confidential information, it is possible that valuable proprietary knowledge may become publicly known through them.\nRisks Related to Our Information Technology, Data Privacy and Intellectual Property\nData breaches, cyber-attacks and other failures in our information technology infrastructure could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, damage our operations and cause significant harm to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, maintain and transmit sensitive data on our networks and systems, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information (such as research data and personal information) and confidential information with respect to our customers, clinical trial patients and our business partners. We have also outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, third parties may or could have access to our confidential information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation, and while we have enhanced and are continuing to enhance our cyber-security efforts commensurate with the growth and complexity of our business, our systems and those of third-party service providers may be vulnerable to a cyber-attack. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the functioning of our information technology infrastructure to carry out our business processes, such as external and internal communications or access to clinical data and other key business information. Accordingly, both inadvertent disruptions to this infrastructure and cyber-attacks could cause us to incur significant remediation or litigation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources.\nWe believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access or otherwise compromise information technology systems. In fact, although the aggregate impact of cyber-attacks on our operations and financial condition has not been material to date, we have frequently been the target of threats of this nature and expect them to continue. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack and motive (including corporate espionage). Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber-attacks continue to become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications and those of our contract manufacturing organizations, contract research organizations or vendors may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose our sensitive business information (or sensitive business information of our collaboration partners, which may lead to significant liability for us). A data security breach could also lead to public exposure of personal information of our clinical trial patients, employees and others. Any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation and business, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents (including the GDPR), subject us to investigations and mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could disrupt our business, result in increased costs or loss of revenue, and/or result in significant financial exposure. Furthermore, the costs of maintaining or upgrading our cyber-security systems at the level necessary to keep up with our expanding operations and prevent against potential attacks are increasing, and despite our best efforts, our network security and data recovery measures and those of our vendors may still not be adequate to protect against such security breaches and disruptions, which could cause material harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to use our technology, which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market.\nOur success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of the intellectual property related to our technologies and products. The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We will continue to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as, where and when we deem lawful and appropriate. However, these\napplications may be challenged or may fail to result in issued patents. Our issued patents have been and may in the future be challenged by third parties as invalid or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws, or they may be infringed by third parties, and we are from time to time involved in the defense and enforcement of our patents or other intellectual property rights in a court of law, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office inter partes review or reexamination proceeding, foreign opposition proceeding or related legal and administrative proceeding in the U.S. and elsewhere. The costs of defending our patents or enforcing our proprietary rights in post-issuance administrative proceedings and litigation can be substantial and the outcome can be uncertain. An adverse outcome may allow third parties to use our intellectual property without a license and/or allow third parties to introduce generic and other competing products, any of which would negatively impact our business. Third parties may also attempt to invalidate or design around our patents, or assert that they are invalid or otherwise unenforceable, and seek to introduce generic versions of cabozantinib. In addition, should any third parties receive FDA approval of an ANDA for a generic version of cabozantinib or an 505(b)(2) NDA with respect to cabozantinib, and if our patents covering cabozantinib were held to be invalid (or if such competing generic versions of cabozantinib were found to not infringe our patents), then they could introduce generic versions of cabozantinib or other such 505(b)(2) products before our patents expire, and the resulting generic competition would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, third parties may have pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, commercialization or use of our product candidates. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patents. In addition, our patents may be challenged or invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages, if, for example, others were the first to invent or to file patent applications for closely related inventions.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties (for example, the patent owner has failed to \u201cwork\u201d the invention in that country or the third-party has patented improvements). In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Initiatives seeking compulsory licensing of life-saving drugs are also becoming increasingly prevalent in developing countries either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Governments in those developing countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products or product candidates, thereby reducing our product sales. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patent and other intellectual property protection, which makes it difficult to stop infringement. We rely on trade secret protection for some of our confidential and proprietary information. We have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, but these measures may not provide adequate protection. While we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, collaborators and consultants, we cannot assure you that our proprietary information will not be disclosed, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nLitigation or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend substantial time and money and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nOur commercial success depends in part upon our ability to avoid infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties and not to breach any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies and the technologies of third parties. Other parties have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and technologies that we have developed or intend to develop. If patents covering technologies required by our operations are issued to others, we may have to obtain licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and may require us to pay substantial royalties, grant a cross-license to some of our patents to another patent holder or redesign the formulation of a product candidate so that we do not infringe third-party patents, which may be impossible to accomplish or could require substantial time and expense.\nIn addition, third parties may obtain patents that relate to our technologies and claim that use of such technologies infringes on their patents or otherwise employs their proprietary technology without authorization. Regardless of their merit, such claims could require us to incur substantial costs, including the diversion of management and technical\npersonnel, in defending ourselves against any such claims or enforcing our own patents. In the event that a successful claim of infringement is brought against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from these third parties, subjecting us to substantial royalty payment obligations. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees and independent contractors were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology, biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that we or these employees or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers, or used or sought to use patent inventions belonging to their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel and/or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop or commercialize certain product candidates, which could severely harm our business.\nRisks Related to Employees and Location\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience growth in the number of our employees and in the scope of our operations. This growth places significant demands on our management, operational and financial resources, and our current and planned personnel, facilities, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our growth. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls and must expand, train and manage our growing employee base, and there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage our growth without experiencing operating inefficiencies or control deficiencies. We expect that we may need to increase our management personnel to oversee our expanding operations, and recruiting and retaining qualified individuals is difficult. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, or are unsuccessful in recruiting qualified management personnel, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our prospects may be adversely affected.\nThe loss of key personnel or the inability to retain and, where necessary, attract additional personnel could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon the principal members of our management, as well as clinical, commercial and scientific staff, the loss of whose services might adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Also, we may not have sufficient personnel to execute our business plans. Retaining and, where necessary, recruiting qualified clinical, commercial and scientific personnel will be critical to support activities related to advancing the development program for cabozantinib and our other compounds, successfully executing upon our commercialization plan for cabozantinib and our internal proprietary research and development efforts. Competition is intense for experienced clinical, commercial and scientific personnel, and we may be unable to retain or recruit such personnel with the expertise or experience necessary to allow us to successfully develop and commercialize our products. Further, all of our employees are employed \u201cat will\u201d and, therefore, may leave our employment at any time.\nAdditionally, in the second quarter of 2018, we moved our corporate headquarters from South San Francisco, California to Alameda, California. This relocation may make it more difficult to retain certain employees, and any resulting loss of talent and need to recruit and train new employees could be disruptive to our business.\nOur operations might be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\nOur headquarters in Alameda, California is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and therefore our facilities are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. We have limited earthquake insurance, which may not cover all of the damage we may suffer in the event of an earthquake. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including fires and floods, which have become a significant danger in California during recent years, as well as power loss, communications failures, terrorism and similar events, and any insurance we may maintain may be inadequate to cover our losses. If any\ndisaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be seriously, or potentially completely, impaired. In addition, a disaster could cause significant delays in our programs and make it difficult for us to recover due to the unique nature of our research activities. Accordingly, an earthquake or other disaster could materially and adversely harm our ability to conduct business.\nFacility security breaches may disrupt our operations, subject us to liability and harm our operating results.\nAny break-in or trespass at our facilities that results in the misappropriation, theft, sabotage or any other type of security breach with respect to our proprietary and confidential information, including research or clinical data, or that results in damage to our research and development equipment and assets, or that results in physical or psychological harm to any of our employees, could subject us to liability and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Product Liability\nWe use hazardous chemicals and biological materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations produce hazardous waste products. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. We may face liability for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and such liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts.\nIn addition, our collaborators may use hazardous materials in connection with our collaborative efforts. In the event of a lawsuit or investigation, we could be held responsible for any injury caused to persons or property by exposure to, or release of, any hazardous materials used by these parties. Further, we may be required to indemnify our collaborators against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.\nWe face potential product liability exposure far in excess of our limited insurance coverage.\nWe may be held liable if any product we or our collaborators develop or commercialize causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims could result in decreased demand for our products and product candidates, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of patients from our clinical trials, product recall, substantial monetary awards to third parties and the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop in the future. These claims might be made directly by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or testing our products. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and commercial activities for cabozantinib in the amount of $20.0 million per occurrence and $20.0 million in the aggregate. However, our insurance may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, if insurance coverage becomes more expensive, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. On occasion, juries have awarded large judgments in class action lawsuits for claims based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. In addition, the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in general, have been subject to significant medical malpractice litigation. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could harm our reputation and business and would decrease our cash reserves.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline, causing investor losses.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. A number of factors, many of which we cannot control, could subject our operating results to volatility, including:\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ and the revenues we generate from those approved products;\n\u2022\ncustomer ordering patterns for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, which may vary significantly from period to period as a result of multiple factors, including pricing information required to be disclosed by us pursuant to drug pricing transparency laws;\n\u2022\nthe overall level of demand for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, including the impact of any competitive products and the duration of therapy for patients receiving CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ;\n\u2022\nthe achievement of stated regulatory and commercial milestones and royalties paid under our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda;\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of and revenues generated by products marketed under our collaboration and license agreements;\n\u2022\nchanges in the amount of deductions from gross sales, including changes to the discount percentage of rebates and chargebacks mandated by the government programs in which we participate, including increases in the government discount percentage resulting from price increases we have taken or may take in the future, or due to different levels of utilization by entities entitled to government rebates and chargebacks and changes in patient demographics;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with maintaining our sales, marketing, market access, medical affairs and product distribution capabilities for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ;\n\u2022\nthe achievement of stated regulatory and commercial milestones under our collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nthe progress and scope of other development and commercialization activities for cabozantinib and our other compounds;\n\u2022\nfuture clinical trial results;\n\u2022\nour future investments in the expansion of our pipeline through drug discovery and business development activities;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved drug product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nrecognition of upfront licensing or other fees or revenues;\n\u2022\npayments of non-refundable upfront or licensing fees, or payment for cost-sharing expenses, to third parties;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new technologies or products by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing and willingness of collaborators to further develop or, if approved, commercialize our product candidates out-licensed to them;\n\u2022\nthe termination or non-renewal of existing collaborations or third-party vendor relationships;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions with respect to our product candidates and any approved products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of expenses incurred for clinical development and manufacturing of cabozantinib;\n\u2022\nadjustments to expenses accrued in prior periods based on management\u2019s estimates after the actual level of activity relating to such expenses becomes more certain;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of acquired goodwill and other assets;\n\u2022\nsignificant fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our or our collaborators\u2019 research and development expenditures; and\n\u2022\nother factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined, based on our facts and circumstances, that it was more likely than not that a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets would be realized and, as a result, substantially all of our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was released. Therefore, beginning in 2019, we expect to commence recording income tax expense at an estimated tax rate that will likely approximate statutory tax rates, which would result in a significant reduction in our net income and net income per share.\nDue to the possibility of such fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance. As a result, in some future\nquarters, our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile, and we believe the trading price of our common stock will remain highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to factors such as the following, many of which we cannot control:\n\u2022\nadverse or inconclusive results or announcements related to our or our collaborators\u2019 clinical trials or delays in those clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of FDA approval or non-approval, or delays in the FDA review process with respect to cabozantinib, our collaborators\u2019 product candidates being developed in combination with cabozantinib, or our competitors\u2019 product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ and the revenues we generate from those approved products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of achievement of our clinical, regulatory, partnering and other milestones, such as the commencement of clinical development, the completion of a clinical trial, the filing for regulatory approval or the establishment of collaborative arrangements for cabozantinib or any of our other programs or compounds;\n\u2022\nactions taken by regulatory agencies, both in the U.S. and abroad, with respect to cabozantinib or our clinical trials for cabozantinib;\n\u2022\nunanticipated regulatory actions taken by the FDA as a result of changing FDA standards and practices concerning the review of product candidates, including approvals at earlier stages of clinical development or with lesser developed data sets and expedited reviews;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products or clinical trial data by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of regulatory applications seeking a path to U.S. approval of generic versions of our marketed products;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our relationships with our collaborators, including the termination or modification of our agreements;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of an in-licensed product candidate or strategic acquisition;\n\u2022\nconflicts or litigation with our collaborators;\n\u2022\nlitigation, including intellectual property infringement and product liability lawsuits, involving us;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve operating results projected by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe entry into new financing arrangements;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical industry;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock or sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nadditions and departures of key personnel or board members;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement is available for both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers, managed care programs and other third-party payers;\n\u2022\ndisposition of any of our technologies or compounds; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nThese factors, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks in particular, have historically experienced significant volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. For example, negative publicity regarding drug pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact,\nthe markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. Likewise, as a result of the pending Brexit and/or significant changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade and health care spending and delivery, including possible repeal and/or replacement of all or portions of PPACA or increases or changes in tariffs and other trade restrictions stemming from Trump administration and foreign government policies, or future U.S. federal government shutdowns, the financial markets could experience significant volatility that could also negatively impact the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Excessive volatility may continue for an extended period of time following the date of this report.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent or deter attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of us, a change in control, or attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our current Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified Board of Directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.", "PERMNO": 88159, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EXEL"}
