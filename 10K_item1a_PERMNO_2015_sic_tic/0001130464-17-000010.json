The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company. These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially.\nOPERATING RISKS\nOur current or future development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.\nExecution of our future growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future development, expansion and acquisition activities. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete development projects or acquisitions we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth. Factors that could cause our development, expansion and acquisition activities to be unsuccessful include:\n\u2022\nOur inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals or the imposition of adverse conditions upon the approval of any acquisition;\n\u2022\nOur inability to secure adequate utility rates through regulatory proceedings;\n\u2022\nOur inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nThe possibility that one or more credit rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;\n\u2022\nOur inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nOur inability to attract and retain management or other key personnel;\n\u2022\nOur inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;\n\u2022\nReduced growth in the demand for utility services in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nChanges in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations, particularly those which would make it more difficult or costly to fully develop our coal reserves, our oil and gas reserves or our power generation capacity;\n\u2022\nFuel prices or fuel supply constraints;\n\u2022\nPipeline capacity and transmission constraints;\n\u2022\nCompetition within our industry and with producers of competing energy sources; and\n\u2022\nChanges in tax rates and policies.\nThe SourceGas Transaction may not achieve its intended results, including anticipated operating efficiencies and cost savings, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile management expects that the SourceGas Transaction will result in various benefits, including a significant amount of operating efficiencies and other financial and operational benefits, there can be no assurance regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to realize these operating efficiencies or other benefits. Events outside of our control, including but not limited to regulatory changes or developments, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the transaction.\nOur financial performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. If the risks involved in our operations are not appropriately managed or mitigated, our operations may not be successful and this could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOperating electric generating facilities, oil and gas properties, the coal mine and electric and natural gas distribution systems involves risks, including:\n\u2022\nOperational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nInterruptions to supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation and distribution. Our utilities purchase fuel from a number of suppliers. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the delivery of fuel due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather and environmental regulations, which could limit our utilities\u2019 ability to operate their facilities;\n\u2022\nBreakdown or failure of equipment or processes, including those operated by PacifiCorp at the Wyodak plant;\n\u2022\nOur ability to transition and replace our retirement-eligible utility employees. At December 31, 2016, approximately 27% of our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities employees were eligible for regular or early retirement;\n\u2022\nInability to recruit and retain skilled technical labor;\n\u2022\nDisrupted transmission and distribution. We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers. If transmission is interrupted, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;\n\u2022\nOperating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including explosions, affecting our natural gas distribution system which could impact public safety, reliability and customer confidence;\n\u2022\nElectricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with power lines or electrical service facilities and equipment. Natural conditions and other disasters such as wind, lightning and winter storms can cause wildfires, pole failures and associated property damage and outages;\n\u2022\nDisruption in the functioning of our information technology and network infrastructure which are vulnerable to disability, failures and unauthorized access. If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions; and\n\u2022\nLabor relations. Approximately 27% of our employees are represented by a total of seven collective bargaining agreements.\nConstruction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce profitability.\nThe construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:\n\u2022\nThe inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals;\n\u2022\nContractual restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;\n\u2022\nThe cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;\n\u2022\nThe unavailability or increased cost of equipment;\n\u2022\nThe cost of recruiting and retaining or the unavailability of skilled labor;\n\u2022\nSupply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes;\n\u2022\nIncreased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nOpposition by members of public or special-interest groups;\n\u2022\nWeather interferences;\n\u2022\nAvailability and cost of fuel supplies;\n\u2022\nUnexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and\n\u2022\nUnanticipated cost overruns.\nThe ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology. Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties. While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.\nOperating results can be adversely affected by variations from normal weather conditions.\nOur utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. Demand for natural gas depends heavily upon winter-weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons. Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter. Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur businesses are located in areas that could be subject to seasonal natural disasters such as severe snow and ice storms, flooding and wildfires. These factors could result in interruption of our business, damage to our property such as power lines and substations, and repair and clean-up costs associated with these storms. We may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution property following these natural disasters through a change in our regulated rates thereby resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur Mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control which could affect our profitability and production levels. Our surface mining operations could be disrupted or materially affected due to adverse weather or natural disasters such as heavy snow, strong winds, rain or flooding.\nWhile our planned activity related to our Oil and Gas segment is limited, weather conditions can also limit or temporarily halt our drilling, completion and producing activities at our crude oil and natural gas operations. Primarily in the winter and spring, our operations can be curtailed because of cold, snow and wet conditions, and severe weather could exacerbate these operational issues. In addition, weather conditions and other events could temporarily impair our ability to transport our crude oil and natural gas production.\nPrices for some of our products and services as well as a portion of our operating costs are volatile and may cause our revenues and expenses to fluctuate significantly.\nA portion of our net income is attributable to sales of contract and off-system wholesale electricity and natural gas. Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather, general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets. Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, wholesale power markets may be subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time.\nThe success of our crude oil and natural gas operations is affected by the prevailing market prices of crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices and markets historically have been, and are likely to continue to be, unpredictable. A decrease in crude oil or natural gas prices not only reduces revenues and profits, but also reduces the quantity and value of reserves that are commercially recoverable and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the net capitalized cost of these assets. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.\nThe proliferation of domestic crude oil and natural gas shale plays in recent years has provided the market with an abundant new supply of crude oil and natural gas, which has driven prices down in recent years. There is also risk that increased domestic resources could drive both crude oil and natural gas prices lower.\nOur mining operation requires reliable supplies of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products. If the cost of these increase significantly, or if sources of supplies and mining equipment become unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our productivity and profitability could be lower than our current expectations.\nOur revenues, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by customer growth and usage in our service territories and may fluctuate with current economic conditions, emerging technologies or responses to price increases.\nOur revenues, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by demand in our service territories. Customer growth and usage may be impacted by a number of factors, including: the voluntary reduction of consumption of electricity and natural gas by our customers in response to increases in prices and demand-side management programs, economic conditions impacting decreases in customers\u2019 disposable income and the use of distributed generation resources or other emerging technologies. Continued technological improvements may make customer and third-party distributed generation and energy storage systems, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines, solar cells and batteries, more cost effective and feasible for our customers. If more customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us would decline. Such developments could affect the price of energy and delivery of energy, require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. Each of these factors could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy our obligations.\nOur Electric Utilities, Gas Utilities and Power Generation segment rely on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to ratepayers, to supply our natural gas-fired power plants and to hedge commodity costs. If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatory authorities.\nOur utilities are subject to pipeline safety and system integrity laws and regulations that may require significant capital expenditures or significant increases in operating costs.\nCompliance with pipeline safety and system integrity laws and regulations, or future changes in these laws and regulations, may result in increased capital, operating and other costs which may not be recoverable in a timely manner from customers in rates. Failure to comply may result in fines, penalties, or injunctive measures that would not be recoverable from customers in rates and could result in a material impact on our financial results.\nOur energy production, transmission and distribution activities, and our storage facilities for our natural gas involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other catastrophic events that could give rise to additional costs and cause a substantial loss to us.\nInherent in our natural gas and electricity transmission and distribution activities, as well as in our production, transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas and our Mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blowouts, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and operational problems. These events could impact the safety of employees or others and result in injury or loss of human life, and cause significant damage to property or natural resources (including public lands), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial financial losses to us. Particularly for our transmission and distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be substantial. While we maintain liability and property insurance coverage, such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThreats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact our operations in unpredictable ways.\nTerrorist acts or other similar events could harm our businesses by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets and could adversely affect our operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels. They could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.\nThe implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs. These types of events could materially adversely affect our financial results. In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.\nA cyber attack may disrupt our operations, or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information and create a potential liability.\nWe use and operate sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees. Cyber attacks targeting our electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and for electric and gas distribution systems, could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations. Cyber attacks targeting other key information technology systems could further add to a full or partial disruption to our operations. Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches. Any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.\nWe have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets, including certain safeguards required by FERC. The security measures and safeguards we have implemented may not always be effective due to the evolving nature and sophistication of cyber attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our information technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access, including cyber attacks. If our information technology systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber attack or a computer virus and be unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised which could have a material adverse effect not only on our financial results, but on our public reputation as well.\nIncreased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nBusiness activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government. Agencies that historically sought voluntary compliance, or issued non-monetary sanctions, now employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations. The FERC, NERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC and MSHA may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or our financial results.\nCertain Federal laws, including the Migratory Bird Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species. These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for non-permitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals, including damage to their habitats. If such species are located in an area in which we conduct operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, our operations and development projects, particularly transmission, generation, wind, pipeline or drilling projects, could be restricted or delayed, or we could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.\nUtilities\nRegulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and therefore are not recoverable.\nOur regulated electric and gas utility operations are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels. Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time. While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs, including our direct and allocated borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission.\nTo some degree, each of our gas and electric utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) without having to file a rate case. To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers; we may be required to refund such costs. Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.\nIf market or other conditions adversely affect operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy in any of our utility businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Any significant impairment of our goodwill related to these utilities would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWe had approximately $1.3 billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016. A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the SourceGas Acquisition and the Aquila Transaction. If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets, net income and shareholders\u2019 equity. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including: future business operating performance, changes in economic conditions and interest rates, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies. Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge.\nMunicipal governments may seek to limit or deny franchise privileges which could inhibit our ability to secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.\nMunicipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries. Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain. If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.\nMining\nIf the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated.\nWe conduct surface mining operations that are subject to operations, reclamation and closure standards. We estimate our total reclamation liabilities based on permit requirements, engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to these requirements. The estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by our management and engineers and by government regulators. The estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions or if government regulations change significantly. GAAP requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value, which reflects the present value of the estimated future cash flows. In estimating future cash flows, we consider the estimated current cost of reclamation and apply inflation rates. The resulting estimated reclamation obligations could change significantly if actual amounts or the timing of these expenses change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nEstimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three-dimensional structural modeling, and any inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the estimated quantity and quality of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating coal reserves is uncertain and requires interpretations and modeling. Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserve estimates. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies. Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates. In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates.\nOil and Gas\nOur inability to successfully include our Oil and Gas segment core assets in utility Cost of Service Gas Programs may result in additional material impairments of our Oil and Gas assets.\nIn our oil and gas business, we are actively divesting non-core assets while retaining those assets best suited for a Cost of Service Gas Program for our utilities and third-party utilities, and have refocused our professional staff on assisting with the implementation of a Cost of Service Gas Program. The implementation of Cost of Service Gas Programs will provide a long-term physical hedge for a portion of a utility\u2019s gas supply, enhancing the quality of the overall gas supply portfolio. In addition to providing utility customers the potential benefits associated with more predictable and lower long-term natural gas prices, it also provides utilities an opportunity to increase earnings through investment in gas reserves. Cost of Service Gas Programs require regulatory approval from state commissions that regulate utility participants in these programs. Failure to obtain these approvals may result in additional impairments of our Oil and Gas assets, and could adversely affect the market perception of our business, operating results and stock price.\nEstimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves. Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretation of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Significant variances in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary significantly from those assumed in our estimates. Any significant variance from the assumptions used could cause the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flow to be materially different from our estimates. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production, changes in future capital expenditures and fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in restrictions which could increase costs and cause delays to the completion of certain oil and gas wells and potentially preclude the economic drilling and completion of wells in certain reservoirs.\nHydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used extensively for decades to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on our crude oil and natural gas properties. Hydraulic fracturing involves using mostly water, sand and a small amount of certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to enhance flow of hydrocarbons into the well-bore. The process is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA does assert federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities when diesel comprises part of the fracturing fluid. In addition several agencies of the federal government including the EPA and the BLM are conducting studies of the fracturing stimulation process which may result in additional regulations. In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, to provide the federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.\nIn the event federal, state, local or municipal legal restrictions on the hydraulic fracturing are adopted in areas where we are conducting or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such regulations that may be significant, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from utilizing fracture stimulation and effectively preclude the drilling of wells.\nExploratory and development drilling are speculative activities that may not result in commercially productive reserves. Lack of drilling success could result in uneconomical investments.\nWhile our planned activity related to our Oil and Gas segment is limited, drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. Drilling for oil and gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain. Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including economic conditions, mechanical problems, pressure or irregularities in formations, title problems, weather conditions, compliance with governmental rules and regulations and shortages in or delays in the delivery of equipment and services. Such equipment shortages and delays are caused by the high demand for rigs and other needed equipment by a large number of companies in active drilling basins. Lack of drilling success could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could incur additional write-downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties, which would cause a decrease in our assets and stockholders' equity and could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis, which is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. Two primary factors in the ceiling test are natural gas and crude oil reserve quantities, which are impacted by current commodity prices, and SEC-defined crude oil and gas prices, both of which impact the present value of estimated future net revenues. We recorded non-cash impairment charges in 2016 and 2015 due to the full cost ceiling limitations. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFINANCING RISKS\nOur credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future. If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs.\nOur issuer credit rating is Baa2 (Stable outlook) by Moody\u2019s; BBB (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB+ (Negative outlook) by Fitch. Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on reasonable terms, or at all. A credit rating downgrade, particularly to a sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades. In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities.\nDerivatives regulations included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.\nDodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared resulting in a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as \u201cmargin\u201d) for such transactions. Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users such as utilities and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions.\nWe use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments for our hedging activities for our oil and gas production activities and our gas utility operations. We also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations. As a result of Dodd-Frank regulations promulgated by the CFTC, we may be required to post collateral to clearing entities for certain swap transactions we enter into. In addition our exchange-traded futures contracts are subject to futures margin posting requirements, which could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate uncertainty and to protect cash flows. Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt. In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability.\nOur hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to accounting requirements associated with such activities.\nWe use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and financial market risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities or assets being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.\nFrom time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms. To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor. In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.\nMarket performance or changes in other assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nAs discussed in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have one defined benefit pension plan and several defined post-retirement healthcare plans and non-qualified retirement plans that cover certain eligible employees. Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans. These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.\nWe have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries. Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries.\nAs a holding company, our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital, equity or debt service funds.\nThere is no assurance as to the amount, if any, of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements and financial conditions and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Our operating subsidiaries have certain restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of dividends or loans to us. See \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d within Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.\nOur ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital. Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings, and proceeds from asset sales. Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices, and general economic and market conditions.\nIn addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service. Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.\nNational and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nA future recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as from our non-utility customers. If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.\nOur ability to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. Our insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.\nOur ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting insurance businesses, international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all, or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us. A loss for which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including but not limited to environmental hazards, fire-related liability from natural events or inadequate facility maintenance, risks associated with our oil and gas exploration and production activities, distribution property losses, cyber-security risks and dangers that exist in the gathering and transportation of gas in pipelines.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage for our operated wells and we participate in insurance coverage maintained by the operators of our wells, there can be no assurances that such coverage will be sufficient to prevent a material adverse effect to us if any of the foregoing events occur.\nIncreasing costs associated with our health care plans and other benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nThe costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. Significant regulatory developments have, and likely will continue to, require changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes, as well as changes to the cost of our plans, and the increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nOur electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits. As benefit costs continue to rise, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will allow recovery.\nAn effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.\nPrior to the Acquisition, SourceGas was a private company, exempt from reporting and control requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As permitted by the guidance set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the acquired SourceGas businesses are not included in management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2016. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls. During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists. Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. While we expect our control system to adequately integrate the SourceGas processes, we cannot be certain that our current design for internal control over financial reporting, or any additional changes to be made, will be sufficient to enable management to determine that our internal controls are effective for any period, or on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, market perception of our business, operating results and stock price could be adversely affected.\nENVIRONMENTAL RISKS\nFederal and state laws concerning greenhouse gas regulations and air emissions may materially increase our generation and production costs and could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.\nWe own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado. Recent developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants may result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs of operations. Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \u201cEnvironmental Matters.\u201d\nThe GHG Tailoring Rule, effective June 2010, will impact us in the event of a major modification at an existing facility or in the event of a new major source as defined by EPA regulations. Upon renewal of operating permits for existing facilities, monitoring and reporting requirements will be implemented. New projects or major modifications to existing projects will result in a Best Available Control Technology review that could impose more stringent emissions control practices and technologies. The EPA\u2019s GHG New Source Performance Standard for new steam electric generating units, published October 2015, effectively prohibits new coal-fired units until carbon capture and sequestration becomes technically and economically feasible.\nOn October 23, 2015, the EPA finalized the CPP to cut carbon emissions from existing electric generating units. The design of the CPP is to decrease existing coal-fired generation, increase the utilization of existing gas generation, increase renewable energy and demand side management. The rule, which does not propose to regulate individual emission sources, calls for each state to develop plans to meet the EPA-assigned statewide average emission rate target for that state by 2030. The rule also allows states to formulate a regional approach whereby they would join with other states and be assigned a new single target for the group. The U.S. Supreme Court entered an order staying the CPP in February 2016, pending appeal. The effect of the order is to delay the CPP\u2019s compliance deadlines until challenges to the CPP have been fully litigated and the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled. In 2015 and again in 2016, we met with the staff of state air programs and public utility commissions on several occasions. We will continue to work closely with state regulatory staff as these plans develop.\nDue to uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal climate change legislation, legal challenges, state clean power plan developments or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nNew or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, the closure or reduction of load of coal generating facilities and potential increased load of our combined cycle natural gas fired units. To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements. We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by those non-regulated power plants. Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain.\nThe costs to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental laws, regulations or requirements, and any failure to do so, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nOur business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state, tribal and local authorities. We generally must obtain and comply with a variety of regulations, licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate, which can require significant capital expenditure and operating costs. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of penalties, liens or fines, claims for property damage or personal injury, or environmental clean-up costs. In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, which could require additional unexpected expenditures or cause us to reevaluate the feasibility of continued operations at certain sites and have a detrimental effect on our business.\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we assumed liabilities associated with the environmental condition of certain properties, regardless of when such liabilities arose, whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those properties for environmental liabilities. Future steps to bring our facilities into compliance or to address contamination from legacy operations, if necessary, could be expensive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Environmental compliance expenditures could be substantial in the future if the trend towards stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the number of assets we operate continues.\nThe characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization and the use of alternative energy sources for power generation as mandated by states could reduce coal consumption.\nFuture regulations may require further reductions in emissions of mercury, hazardous pollutants, SO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter and GHG, which are released into the air when coal is burned. These requirements could require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures. Reductions in mercury emissions required by EPA\u2019s MATS rule described earlier, will likely require some power plants to install new equipment, at substantial cost, or discourage the use of certain coals containing higher levels of mercury. The EPA\u2019s October 23, 2015 CPP described earlier, which has been stayed pending appeal, is designed to reduce carbon emissions from existing electric generating units. The basis of the CPP is to decrease existing coal-fired generation, increase the utilization of existing gas fired combined cycle generation, increase renewable energy and demand side management. This rule could have a significant impact on our coal and natural gas generating fleet. The rule calls for states to develop plans to meet their assigned emission rate targets by 2030. The rule also allows states to formulate a regional approach whereby they would join with other states and be assigned a new single target for the group.\nCoal competes with other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, solar and hydropower. The CPP regulation is expected to have an adverse effect on coal as a domestic energy source, and could have a significant impact on our mining operations.\nExisting or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal. If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted.", "PERMNO": 61946, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "BKH"}
