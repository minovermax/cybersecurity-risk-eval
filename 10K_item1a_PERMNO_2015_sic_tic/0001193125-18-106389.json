{"cik": "1525769", "company": "Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nWe wish to caution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors listed below are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this Report, and our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases, written or electronic communications, and verbal statements by our representatives.\nYou should be aware that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause our or our industry\u2019s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words like \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d and other similar expressions that convey uncertainty about future events or outcomes.\nThe impact that economic conditions in the United States and Canada have on consumer discretionary spending could impact our business and financial performance.\nAny significant decrease in consumer confidence, or periods of economic slowdown or recession, could lead to a curtailing of discretionary spending, which in turn could reduce our revenues and results of operations and adversely affect our financial position. Our business is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending and therefore is affected by consumer confidence as well as the future performance of the United States and Canadian economies. As a result, our results of operations are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions. Increases in job losses, home foreclosures, energy prices, investment losses in the financial markets, personal bankruptcies, credit card debt and home mortgage and other borrowing costs, declines in housing values and reduced access to credit, among other factors, may result in lower levels of customer traffic in our stores, a decline in consumer confidence and a curtailing of consumer discretionary spending. We believe that consumers generally are more willing to make discretionary purchases during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. If economic conditions worsen, whether in the United States or in the communities in which our stores are located, we could see deterioration in customer traffic or a reduction in the average amount customers spend in our stores. A reduction in revenues will result in sales de-leveraging (spreading our fixed costs across the lower level of sales) and will in turn cause downward pressure on our profit margins. This could result in reduction of staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential store closures, a deceleration of new store openings and an inability to comply with the covenants under our credit facility.\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability to open new stores and operate them profitably.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to open additional stores in locations that we believe will provide attractive returns on investment. We have identified a number of additional sites for potential future Dave & Buster\u2019s stores. Our ability to open new stores on a timely and cost-effective basis, or at all, is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nfind quality locations;\n\u2022\nreach acceptable agreements regarding the lease or purchase of locations;\n\u2022\ncomply with applicable zoning, licensing, land use and environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nraise or have available an adequate amount of cash or currently available financing for construction and opening costs;\n\u2022\ntimely hire, train and retain the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs;\n\u2022\nobtain, for acceptable cost, required permits and approvals, including liquor licenses; and\n\u2022\nefficiently manage the amount of time and money used to build and open each new store.\nIf we succeed in opening new stores on a timely and cost-effective basis, we may nonetheless be unable to attract enough customers to new stores because potential customers may be unfamiliar with our stores or concept, or our entertainment and menu options might not appeal to them. Our new stores may not meet or exceed the performance of our existing stores or meet or exceed our performance targets, including target cash-on-cash returns. New stores may even operate at a loss, which could have a significant adverse effect on our overall operating results. If the expected future cash flows for a store are less than the asset carrying amount (an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable), we may recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess of the asset carrying amount over the fair value. Opening a new store in an existing market could reduce the revenue at our existing stores in that market. In addition, historically, new stores experience a drop in revenues after their first year of operation. Typically, this drop has been temporary and has been followed by increases in comparative store revenue in line with the rest of our comparable store base, but there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future or that a new store will succeed in the long term.\nOur expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with the area.\nSome of our new stores will be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, local regulatory requirements, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause our new stores to be less successful than stores in our existing markets. In addition, our national advertising program may not be successful in generating brand awareness in all local markets, and the lack of market awareness of the Dave & Buster\u2019s brand can pose an additional risk in expanding into new markets. Stores opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly revenues than stores opened in existing markets, and may have higher store-level operating expense ratios than stores in existing markets. Sales at stores opened in new markets may take longer to reach average store revenues, if at all, thereby adversely affecting our overall profitability.\nIn addition, we intend to establish stores outside of the United States and Canada. In addition to the risks posed by new markets generally, the operating conditions in overseas markets may vary significantly from those we have experienced in the past, including in relation to consumer preferences, regulatory environment, currency risk, the presence and cooperation of suitable local partners and availability of vendors or commercial and physical infrastructure, among others. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new stores into our operations, achieving market acceptance, operating these stores profitably, and maintaining compliance with the rapidly changing business and regulatory requirements of new markets. If we are unable to do so, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete favorably in the highly competitive out-of-home and home-based entertainment and restaurant markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe out-of-home entertainment market is highly competitive. We compete for customers\u2019 discretionary entertainment dollars with providers of out-of-home entertainment, including localized attraction facilities such as movie theatres, sporting events, bowling alleys, sports activity centers, arcades and entertainment centers, nightclubs and restaurants as well as theme parks. Many of the entities operating these businesses are larger and have significantly greater financial resources, a greater number of stores, have been in business longer, have greater name recognition and are better established in the markets where our stores are located or are planned to be located. As a result, they may be able to invest greater resources than we can in attracting customers and succeed in attracting customers who would otherwise come to our stores. The legalization of casino gambling in geographic areas near any current or future store would create the possibility for entertainment alternatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We also face competition from local, regional and national establishments that offer entertainment experiences similar to ours and restaurants that are highly competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambience and type and quality of food. We also face competition from increasingly sophisticated home-based forms of entertainment, such as internet and video gaming and home movie streaming and delivery. Our failure to compete favorably in\nthe competitive out-of-home and home-based entertainment and restaurant markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur sales growth and ability to achieve profitability could be adversely affected if comparable store sales are less than we expect.\nComparable store sales are a year-over-year comparison of sales at stores open at the end of the period which have been open for at least 18 months as of the beginning of each of the fiscal years. It is a key performance indicator used within the industry and is indicative of acceptance of our initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. The level of comparable store sales will affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting our ability to generate profits because the profit margin on comparable store sales is generally higher than the profit margin on new store sales. Notwithstanding our initiatives intended to drive our comparable store sales, there is no guarantee that these initiatives will be successful. This failure to build sales, or a significant decrease in comparable store sales, could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve target profit margins and our overall business, financial condition and results of operations. As adjusted for the 53rd week, comparable store sales decreased 0.9% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and decreased 5.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nOur revenues generally fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the seasonality of our business and other events.\nOur operating results fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonal factors. Typically, we have higher first and fourth quarter revenues associated with the spring and year-end holidays. Our third quarter, which encompasses the back-to-school fall season, has historically had lower revenues as compared to the other quarters. As a result, factors affecting peak seasons could have a disproportionate effect on our results. For example, the number of days between Thanksgiving and New Year\u2019s Day and the days of the week on which Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve fall affect the volume of business we generate during the December holiday season and can affect our results for the full fiscal year. In addition, adverse weather during the winter and spring seasons could have a significant impact on our quarterly results.\nOur results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to the timing of new store openings.\nThe timing of new store openings may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly performance. We typically incur most cash pre-opening costs for a new store within the two months immediately preceding, and the month of, the store\u2019s opening. In addition, the labor and operating costs for a newly opened store during the first three to six months of operation are materially greater than what can be expected after that time, both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues. Additionally, a portion of a current fiscal year new store capital expenditures is related to stores that are not expected to open until the following fiscal year. Due to these substantial up-front financial requirements to open new stores, the investment risk related to any single store is much larger than that associated with many other restaurants or entertainment venues.\nSlow economic growth or a recession could have a material adverse impact on our landlords or other tenants in shopping centers in which we are located, which in turn could negatively affect our financial results.\nIf we experience an economic downturn in the future, our landlords may be unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required tenant improvement allowances or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition, tenants at shopping centers in which we are located or have executed leases, or to which our stores are near, may fail to open or may cease operations. Decreases in total tenant occupancy in shopping centers in which we are located, or to which our stores are near, may affect traffic at our stores. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nDamage to our brand or reputation could adversely affect our business.\nOur brand and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends, in part, upon the external perception of our Company, the quality of our food service and facilities and our integrity. Multi-store businesses, such as ours, can be adversely affected by unfavorable publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness or health concerns, or a variety of other operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of stores. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of electronic communication. Adverse publicity involving any of these factors could make our stores less appealing, reduce our customer traffic and/or impose practical limits on pricing. In the future, our stores may be operated by franchisees. Any such franchisees will be independent third parties that we do not control. Although our franchisees will be contractually obligated to operate the store in accordance with our standards, we would not oversee their daily operations. If one or more of our stores were the subject of unfavorable publicity and we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, our overall brand could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are susceptible to changes in the availability and the cost of food and other supplies, in most cases from a limited number of suppliers, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and other supply costs. Various factors beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions, governmental regulation and monetary policy, product availability, recalls of food products, and seasonality, as well as the effects of the current macroeconomic environment on our suppliers, may affect our commodity costs or cause a disruption in our supply chain. In an effort to mitigate some of this risk, we have multiple short-term supply contracts with a limited number of suppliers. If any of these suppliers do not perform adequately or otherwise fail to distribute products or supplies to our stores, we may be unable to replace the suppliers in a short period of time on acceptable terms, which could increase our costs, cause shortages of food and other items at our stores and cause us to remove certain items from our menu. Changes in the price or availability of commodities for which we do not have short-term supply contracts could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Expiring contracts with our food suppliers could also result in unfavorable renewal terms and therefore increase costs associated with these suppliers or may necessitate negotiations with other suppliers. Other than short-term supply contracts for certain food items, we currently do not engage in futures contracts or other financial risk management strategies with respect to potential price fluctuations in the cost of food and other supplies. Also, the unplanned loss of a major distributor could adversely affect our business by disrupting our operations as we seek out and negotiate a new distribution contract. If we have to pay higher prices for food or other supplies, our operating costs may increase, and, if we are unable to adjust our purchasing practices or pass such cost increases on to our customers by changing menu prices, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur procurement of games and amusement offerings is dependent upon a few suppliers.\nOur ability to continue to procure new games, amusement offerings, and other entertainment-related equipment is important to our business strategy. The number of suppliers from which we can purchase games, amusement offerings and other entertainment-related equipment is limited. To the extent that the number of suppliers declines, we could be subject to the risk of distribution delays, pricing pressure, lack of innovation and other associated risks.\nIn addition, any increase in cost or decrease in availability of new amusement offerings that appeal to customers could adversely impact our revenues as well as the cost to acquire and operate new amusements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could also lead to decreases in revenues as customers negatively react to lack of new game options. We may not be able to anticipate and react to changing amusement offerings cost by adjusting purchasing practices or game prices, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur operations are susceptible to the availability of systems and services provided by third-parties, which subject us to possible risk of shortages and interruptions.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for certain key elements of our operations including credit card processing, telecommunications and utilities. The unplanned loss of services from a major provider could adversely affect our business as we seek out and negotiate for alternate sources of service. We may be unable to replace service providers in a short period of time on acceptable terms, which could limit our operations and increase our costs. If our cost of services increases, we may be unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers, and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nFood safety incidents at our stores or in our industry or supply chain may adversely affect customer perception of our brands or industry and result in declines in sales and profits.\nWe cannot guarantee that our supply chain and food safety controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food safety issues at our stores, including any occurrences of foodborne illnesses such as salmonella, E. coli, Norovirus, or hepatitis A. In addition, we rely on third-party vendors, making it difficult to monitor food safety compliance and increasing the risk that foodborne illness would affect multiple locations rather than a single store. Some foodborne illness incidents could be caused by third-party vendors and distributors outside of our control. New illnesses resistant to our current precautions may develop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise, that could give rise to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. One or more instances of foodborne illness in any of our stores or markets or related to food products we sell could negatively affect our store sales nationwide if highly publicized on national media outlets or through social media. This risk exists even if it were later determined that the illness was wrongly attributed to us or one of our stores. A number of restaurant chains have experienced incidents related to foodborne illnesses that have had a material adverse effect on their operations. The occurrence of a similar incident at one or more of our stores, or negative publicity or public speculation about an incident, could reduce customer visits to our stores and negatively impact demand for our menu offerings.\nWe are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long-term, non-cancelable leases.\nWe typically do not own any real property. Payments under our non-cancelable, operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and we expect the new stores we open in the future will also be leased. The leases typically provide for a base rent plus additional rent based on a percentage of the revenue generated by the stores on the leased premises once certain thresholds are met. We generally cannot cancel these leases without substantial economic penalty. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligation under the applicable lease, including, among other things, paying the base rent for the remainder of the lease term. We depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease obligations. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our existing credit facility, we may not be able to service our operating lease obligations, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund other liquidity and capital needs, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, as each of our leases expires, we may choose not to renew, or may not be able to renew, such existing leases if the capital investment required to maintain the stores at the leased locations is not justified by the return required on the investment. If we are not able to renew the leases at rents that allow such stores to remain profitable as their terms expire, the number of such stores may decrease, resulting in lower revenue from operations, or we may relocate a store, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks, and in either case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to operate our stores, or obtain and maintain licenses and permits necessary for such operation, in compliance with laws, regulations and other requirements, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nEach store is subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, amusement, health, sanitation, safety, building code and fire agencies in the state, county and/or municipality in which the store is located. Each store is required to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises from a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. In some states, the loss of a license for cause with respect to one store may lead to the loss of licenses at all stores in that state and could make it more difficult to obtain additional licenses in that state. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of each store, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. We generally have not encountered any material difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses, permits and approvals that could impact the continuing operations of an existing store, or delay or prevent the opening of a new store. Although we do not anticipate any material difficulties occurring in the future, the failure to receive or retain a liquor license, or any other required permit or license, in a particular location, or to continue to qualify for, or renew licenses, could have a material adverse effect on operations and our ability to obtain such a license or permit in other locations.\nAs a result of operating certain entertainment games and attractions, including skill-based games that offer redemption prizes, we are subject to amusement licensing and regulation by the states, counties and municipalities in which our stores are located. These laws and regulations can vary significantly by state, county, and municipality and, in some jurisdictions, may require us to modify our business operations or alter the mix of redemption games and simulators we offer. Moreover, as more states and local communities implement legalized gambling, the laws and corresponding enabling regulations may also be applicable to our redemption games and regulators may create new licensing requirements, taxes or fees, or restrictions on the various types of redemption games we offer. Furthermore, other states, counties and municipalities may make changes to existing laws to further regulate legalized gaming and illegal gambling. Adoption of these laws, or adverse interpretation of existing laws, could require our existing stores in these jurisdictions to alter the mix of games, modify certain games, limit the number of tickets that may be won by a customer from a redemption game, change the mix of prizes that we may offer at our WIN! area or terminate the use of specific games, any of which could adversely affect our operations. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we may be subject to various sanctions and/or penalties and fines or may be required to cease operations until we achieve compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial results.\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; taxes; or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. In addition, recent healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact our labor costs.\nWe are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, gratuities and overtime), along with the Americans with Disabilities Act, various family leave mandates and other federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern working conditions. We have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid wage rates at or based on the applicable federal, state or local minimum wage. Further, we operate in many states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage. We expect increases in payroll expenses as a result of federal, state and local mandated increases in the minimum wage, and we are uncertain of the repercussions, if any, of increased minimum wages\non other expenses. For example, our suppliers may be more severely impacted by higher minimum wage standards, which could result in increased costs to us. In general, we have been able to substantially offset cost increases resulting from changes in minimum wage rates by increasing menu prices, improving productivity, or through other adjustments, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Moreover, although none of our employees have been or are now represented by any unions, labor organizations may seek to represent certain of our employees in the future, and if they are successful, our payroll expenses and other labor costs may be increased in the course of collective bargaining, and/or there may be strikes or other work disruptions that may adversely affect our business.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the \u201cPPACA\u201d) includes provisions requiring health care coverage for all Americans that began in 2014. Higher costs associated with PPACA and similar federal and state legislation could increase our expense. Additionally, our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher health care-related costs, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. We believe our plans meet current requirements, and we continue to review the PPACA and regulations issued related to employee wages and benefits to evaluate the potential impact on our business. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.\nThe PPACA also requires us to comply with federal nutritional disclosure requirements. The Food and Drug Administration has issued regulations to implement the nutritional menu labeling provisions of the PPACA and these final regulations will be effective on May 7, 2018. The regulations establish a uniform, federal requirement for certain restaurants, including ours, to post certain nutritional information on their menus. We will be required to publish the total number of calories of standard menu items on menus, along with a statement that puts this calorie information in the context of a total daily calorie intake. The PPACA also requires us to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information for each standard menu item, and to provide a statement on menus about the availability of this information. The PPACA also permits the Food and Drug Administration to require us to make additional nutrient disclosures, such as disclosure of trans-fat content. An unfavorable report on, or reaction to, our menu ingredients, the size of our portions, or the nutritional content of our menu items could negatively influence the demand for our offerings. We cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu offerings to trends and eating habits. The imposition of menu-labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as the hospitality industry in general.\nImmigration reform continues to attract significant attention in the public arena and the U.S. Congress. If new immigration legislation is enacted, such laws may contain provisions that could increase our costs in recruiting, training and retaining employees. Also, although our hiring practices comply with the requirements of federal law in reviewing employees\u2019 citizenship or authority to work in the United States, increased enforcement efforts with respect to existing immigration laws by governmental authorities may disrupt a portion of our workforce or our operations at one or more of our stores, thereby negatively impacting our business.\nWe are also subject to federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and other requirements. More stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in particular locations. Environmental laws and regulations also govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water as well as the presence, handling, release and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances. These laws provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance. Third parties may also make personal injury, property damage or other claims against us associated with actual or alleged release of, or exposure to, hazardous substances at our properties. We could also be strictly liable, without regard to fault, for certain environmental conditions at properties we formerly owned or operated as well as at our current properties.\nOur sales and results of operations may be adversely affected by climate change and the passage of other environmental legislation and regulations. The costs and other effects of new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. For example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent that such requirements increase prices charged to us by vendors because of increased compliance costs. At this point, we are unable to determine the impact that climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations could have on our overall business.\nOur success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified store management and operating personnel while also controlling our labor costs.\nWe must continue to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified management and operating personnel to maintain consistency in our service, hospitality, quality and atmosphere of our stores, in the United States and Canada. Qualified management and operating personnel are typically in high demand. If we are unable to attract and retain a satisfactory number of qualified management and operating personnel, labor shortages could delay the planned openings of new stores or adversely impact our existing stores. Any such delays, material increases in employee turnover rates in existing stores or widespread employee dissatisfaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur financial performance and the ability to successfully implement our strategic direction could be adversely affected if we fail to retain, or effectively respond, to a loss of key management.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. We have employment agreements with all members of senior management. However, we cannot prevent members of senior management from terminating their employment with us. Losing the services of members of senior management could materially harm our business until a suitable replacement is found, and such replacement may not have equal experience and capabilities. In addition, we have not purchased life insurance on any members of our senior management.\nWe face potential liability with our gift cards under the property laws of some states.\nOur gift cards, which may be used to purchase food, beverages, merchandise and game play credits in our stores, may be considered stored value cards. Certain states include gift cards under their abandoned and unclaimed property laws, and require companies to remit to the state cash in an amount equal to all or a designated portion of the unredeemed balance on the gift cards based on certain card attributes and the length of time that the cards are inactive. To date we have not remitted any amounts relating to unredeemed gift cards to states based upon our assessment of applicable laws.\nThe analysis of the potential application of the abandoned and unclaimed property laws to our gift cards is complex, involving an analysis of constitutional, statutory provisions and factual issues. In the event that one or more states change their existing abandoned and unclaimed property laws or successfully challenge our position on the application of its abandoned and unclaimed property laws to our gift cards, our liabilities with respect to unredeemed gift cards may be materially higher than the amounts shown in our financial statements. If we are required to materially increase the estimated liability recorded in our financial statements with respect to unredeemed gift cards, our net income could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Power Cards may raise similar concerns to gift cards in terms of the applicability of states\u2019 abandoned and unclaimed property laws. However, based on our analysis of abandoned and unclaimed property laws, we believe that our Power Cards are not stored value cards and such laws do not apply, although there can be no assurance that states will not take a different position.\nCustomer complaints or litigation on behalf of our customers or employees may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of our customers or employees. In recent years, a number of restaurant companies, including ours, have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, and a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. We could also face potential liability (which could be material) if we are found to have misclassified certain employees as exempt from the overtime requirements of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and state labor laws, or if we are found to have failed to provide or continue health insurance or benefits to our employees in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or the PPACA. We have had from time to time and now have such lawsuits pending against us. In addition, from time to time, customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a store. We are also subject to a variety of other claims in the ordinary course of business, including personal injury, lease and contract claims.\nWe are also subject to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes in certain states in which our stores are located. These statutes generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated individual. Recent litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments and settlements under dram shop statutes. Because these cases often seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance, such litigation could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from operations and hurt our financial performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage or not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Also, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may materially affect our stores and us.\nLocal conditions, events, terrorist attacks, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our business.\nCertain of the regions in which our stores are located have been, and may in the future be, subject to adverse local conditions, events, terrorist attacks, adverse weather conditions, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes. Depending upon its magnitude, a natural disaster could severely damage our stores, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our corporate headquarters, company-owned distribution center, game repair facility and our data center, as well as our backup data facility are all located in Dallas, Texas. A natural or man-made disaster could significantly impact our ability to provide services and systems to our stores and negatively impact store operations throughout our operations. We currently maintain property and business interruption insurance through the aggregate property policy for each of our stores. However, such coverage may not be sufficient if there is a major disaster. In addition, upon the expiration of our current insurance policies, adequate insurance coverage may not be available at reasonable rates, or at all.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property.\nOur intellectual property is essential to our success and competitive position. We use a combination of intellectual property rights, such as trademarks and trade secrets, to protect our brand and certain other proprietary processes and information material to our business. The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our intellectual property rights to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, we may lose an important advantage in the markets in which we compete. If third parties misappropriate or infringe our intellectual property, the value of our image, brand and the goodwill associated therewith may be diminished, our brand may fail to achieve and maintain market recognition, and our\ncompetitive position may be harmed, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our revenues. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the violation or misappropriation of such intellectual property rights by others. To protect our intellectual property, we may become involved in litigation, which could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management and adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our products and services do not and will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays, materially disrupt the conduct of our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a consequence of such claims, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award, take a royalty-bearing license, discontinue the use of third-party products used within our operations and/or rebrand our business and products.\nDisruptions in our information technology systems could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nWe rely heavily on various information technology systems, including point-of-sale, kiosk and amusement operations systems in our stores, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various other software applications used throughout our operations. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability, integrity and capacity of these systems. Some of these systems have been internally developed or we may rely on third party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, flaws in third party software or services, errors by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyberattacks. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could cause material negative impacts to the efficiency of our operations and our financial results, and remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital expenditures.\nThe unauthorized access to, or theft or destruction of, customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of our proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.\nThe protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to us. We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments, consumer credit and fraud. Additionally, an increasing number of government and industry groups have established laws and standards for the protection of personal and health information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. Compliance with these requirements may result in cost increases due to necessary system changes and the development of new administrative processes, and if we fail to comply with laws and regulations regarding privacy and security, we could be exposed to risks of fines, investigations, litigation and disruption of our operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we receive and maintain certain personal information from our customers, employees and vendors, and we process customer payments using payment information. Customers and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of this customer information, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. A number of restaurant operators and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen. Although we employ security technologies and practices, and have taken other steps to try to prevent a breach, we may nevertheless not have the resources or technical sophistication to prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. In fiscal 2007, there was an external\nbreach of our credit card processing systems, which led to fraudulent credit card activity and resulted in the payment of fines and reimbursements for the fraudulent credit card activity. As part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, we have implemented a series of corrective measures in order to ensure that our computer systems are secure and that our customers\u2019 personal information is protected. If in the future, we experience another security breach, we could become subject to claims, lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the theft of credit or debit card information, compromised security and information systems, failure of our employees to comply with applicable laws, the unauthorized acquisition or use of such information by third parties, or other similar claims. In addition, such breach could put us in violation of our settlement agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Any such incidents or proceedings could disrupt the operation of our stores, adversely affect our reputation, consumer confidence, and our results of operations, or result in the imposition of penalties or cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenditures, including those necessary to remediate any damage to persons whose personal information may have been compromised. Although we have established a cybersecurity policy, which includes a number of procedures designed to increase transparency and address our customers\u2019 concerns regarding data breaches (whether actual or perceived), the policy may not be effective in addressing those concerns, which may in turn adversely affect our reputation and customer confidence. We maintain a separate insurance policy covering cybersecurity risks and such insurance coverage may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, but this policy is subject to a retention amount and may not be applicable to a particular incident or otherwise may be insufficient to cover all our losses beyond any retention. Further, in light of recent court rulings, there is uncertainty as to whether traditional commercial general liability policies will be construed to cover the expenses related to cyberattacks and breaches if credit and debit card information is stolen.\nWe are required to maintain the highest level of Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Data Security Standard compliance at our corporate office and stores. As part of an overall security program and to meet PCI standards, we undergo regular external vulnerability scans and we are reviewed by a third-party assessor. As PCI standards change, we may be required to implement additional security measures. If we do not maintain the required level of PCI compliance, we could be subject to costly fines or additional fees from the card brands that we accept, or lose our ability to accept those payment cards.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results or those of our competitors as compared to analyst expectations, changes in financial estimates by research analysts with respect to us or others in the restaurant and other entertainment industries, and announcement of significant transactions (including mergers or acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives) by us or others in the restaurant and other entertainment industries. In addition, the equity markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that affect the stock price of companies in ways that have been unrelated to an individual company\u2019s operating performance. The price for our common stock may continue to be volatile, based on factors specific to our company and industry, as well as factors related to the equity markets overall.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could result in substantial cost to remediate, and could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, may depress the trading price of our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include certain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company or changes in our management, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of our stockholders to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nour ability to issue preferred stock with terms that the Board of Directors may determine, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only upon the request of a majority of our Board of Directors or our Chief Executive Officer;\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors, which may limit the ability of minority stockholders to elect directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from soliciting proxies to elect a particular slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nThese provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change of control of our Company that is in the best interest of our minority stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nChanges in tax laws and resulting regulations could result in changes to our tax provisions and subject us to additional tax liabilities that could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, such as the December 2017 enactment of Federal legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d), or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect and changes to state tax laws that may occur in response to the Tax Act, could affect our tax expense and profitability. In addition, the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provision and accruals. Changes in our tax provision or an increase in our tax liability, whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulation, the interpretation or application thereof, or a final determination of tax audits or litigation, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.", "PERMNO": 81695, "SIC": 5810, "TIC": "PLAY"}
