Risk Factors.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results may be affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from our past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the accompanying financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Requirements and Financial Condition\nWe have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since inception and expect that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe have not been profitable since we commenced operations and we may never achieve or sustain profitability. As a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, we have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, we have limited history as an organization and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical industry. Drug development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates, commercialized any of our product candidates, or generated any revenue from sales of products. We have devoted significant resources to research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing clinical trials and operations, in addition to acquiring product candidates.\nSince inception, substantial resources have been dedicated to the acquisition and development of our product candidates. We will require significant additional capital to continue operations and to execute on our current business strategy to develop our current product development pipeline through regulatory approval and further develop future product candidates for eventually seeking regulatory approval. We cannot estimate with reasonable certainty the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates and there is no certainty that we will be able to raise the necessary capital on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe audit report on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included an explanatory paragraph related to recurring losses from operations and our dependence on additional financing to continue as a going concern. We have incurred net losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and had an accumulated deficit of $168.8 million as of December 31, 2021. In view of these matters, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt or equity financing or enter into strategic partnerships. We intend to continue to finance our operations through debt or equity financings or strategic partnerships. The failure to obtain sufficient financing or strategic partnerships on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, if at all, could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives and continue as a going concern.\nWe will require substantial additional financing for further development of our product candidates. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development efforts and other operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred losses from operations of $36.8 million and $61.5 million, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities was $29.5 million and $19.4 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $168.8 million and cash and cash equivalents of $47.0 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years as we advance our product candidates through clinical development, U.S. and other regional regulatory approvals and commercialization. No revenue from operations will likely be available until, and unless, one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA or another regulatory agency and successfully marketed, or we enter into an arrangement that provides for licensing revenue or other partnering-related funding, outcomes which we may not achieve on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur capital requirements for the foreseeable future will depend in large part on our expenditures on our development programs. Future expenditures on our development programs are subject to many uncertainties and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including:\n\u2022the number, size, complexity, results and timing of our drug development programs;\n\u2022the number of patients who participate, the rate of enrollment and the potential impact the COVID-19 pandemic could have on the expected timelines for each of our clinical programs;\n\u2022the number and size of nonclinical and clinical studies necessary to demonstrate acceptable evidence of the safety and efficacy of our product candidates;\n\u2022the terms of any collaborative or other strategic arrangement that we may establish;\n\u2022changes in standards of care which could change the size and complexity of clinical studies;\n\u2022the ability to locate patients to participate in a study given the limited number of patients available for orphan or ultra-orphan indications;\n\u2022the number and location of sites and the rate of site initiation in each study;\n\u2022the duration of patient treatment and follow-up;\n\u2022the potential for additional safety monitoring or other post-marketing studies that may be requested by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022the time and cost to manufacture clinical trial material and commercial product, including process development and scale-up activities and to conduct stability studies, which can last several years;\n\u2022the degree of difficulty and cost involved in securing alternate manufacturers or suppliers of drug product, components or delivery devices, as necessary to meet FDA requirements and/or commercial demand;\n\u2022the costs, requirements, timing of, and the ability to, secure regulatory approvals;\n\u2022the extent to which we increase our workforce and the costs involved in recruiting, training and incentivizing and retaining qualified employees;\n\u2022the costs related to developing, acquiring and/or contracting for sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, supply chain management capabilities and regulatory compliance capabilities, if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate and commercialize it without a partner;\n\u2022the costs involved in evaluating competing technologies and market developments or the loss in sales in case of such competition; and\n\u2022the costs involved in establishing, enforcing or defending patent claims and other proprietary rights.\nAdditional capital may not be available when we need it, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we will be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate development activities, our establishment of sales and marketing, manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, conduct preclinical or clinical studies, or other development activities.\nIf we raise additional capital through strategic alliances or licensing arrangements or other collaborations with third parties, we may be required to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable. If we raise additional capital through equity or debt offerings in which the instruments can convert to equity, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferential rights over our common stock. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures, or subject to specified financial ratios, any of which could restrict our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or operate as a business.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy and Operations\nWe are substantially dependent upon the clinical, regulatory and commercial success of our product candidates. Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome; results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results; and our clinical trials may fail to adequately demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities the safety and efficacy of our product candidates.\nThe success of our business is dependent on our ability to advance the clinical development of vurolenatide for the treatment of SBS, larazotide for the treatment of celiac disease and NM-136 for rare obesity disorders. We are also developing larazotide for the treatment of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (\u201cMIS-C\u201d) through a collaboration with EBRIS and NM-003, NM-102 and NM-004 for the treatment of undisclosed rare debilitating digestive diseases with unmet needs. We launched our Phase 2 VIBRANT clinical trial for vurolenatide in the second quarter of 2021 and we\ncurrently anticipate topline data in the second quarter of 2022. In the third quarter of 2019, we started our Phase 3 CeDLara clinical trial for larazotide and we currently anticipate interim analysis in the second quarter of 2022. In the third quarter of 2021, we announced our collaboration with the European Biomedical Research Institute of Salerno, Italy (\u201cEBRIS\u201d) to study larazotide for the treatment of MIS-C and EBRIS initiated a Phase 2a study in the fourth quarter of 2021. NM-102 and NM-004 are being evaluated in ongoing IND-enabling studies in varying indications.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete. The outcome of this testing is inherently uncertain. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not necessarily be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. There is a high failure rate for drugs proceeding through clinical trials and product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the required safety and efficacy despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier clinical trials, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if our clinical trials are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nBecause of the developmental nature of our product candidates, we are subject to risks associated with initiating, completing and achieving positive outcomes from our current and future clinical trials.\nEven if we successfully complete the necessary clinical trials for our product candidates, our success will be subject to the risks associated with obtaining regulatory approvals, product launch and commercialization.\nMany of these clinical, regulatory and commercial matters are beyond our control and are subject to the risks described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to advance our product candidates further through final clinical development or obtain regulatory approval of, commercialize or generate significant revenue from them. If we cannot do so, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted hospitals and medical facilities where we are currently conducting our Phase 2 VIBRANT clinical trial for vurolenatide and Phase 3 CeDLara clinical trial for larazotide. The evolving COVID-19 pandemic has created significant delays for our clinical trials primarily due to multiple site closures because of infected staff and due to patients avoiding or being unable to travel to healthcare facilities and physicians\u2019 offices unless due to a health emergency. The exact duration of these delays and any other impacts will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, the spread of more transmissible variants, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, and the reduction in vaccine efficacy against new variants, the potential for future \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, the severity of COVID-19, or the effectiveness of actions to contain and treat COVID-19. The continued spread of COVID-19 also has and we expect will continue to adversely impact our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19, which could further negatively impact our trials. In addition, if the FDA elects to delay face-to-face meetings for an extended period of time due to COVID-19, it could have a material adverse effect on our Phase 3 CeDLara clinical trial and our other product candidates. Any or all of these events could increase our operating expenses and the length of time to complete our clinical trials and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf we fail to attract and retain senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have historically operated with a limited number of employees. As of the date of this report, we have 21 full-time employees, including 12 employees engaged full-time in research and development. Therefore, institutional knowledge is concentrated within a small number of employees. Our success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel to continue the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. We will need to hire or contract with additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing. Additionally, our future success is highly dependent upon the contributions of our senior management team. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, completion of our planned clinical trials or the commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face intense competition from other companies and organizations for qualified personnel. Other companies and organizations with which we compete for personnel may have greater financial and other resources and different risk profiles than we do, and a history of successful development and commercialization of their product candidates. Replacing key employees and attracting sufficiently skilled new employees may be difficult and costly, and we may not have other personnel with the capacity to assume all the responsibilities of a key employee upon his or her departure or to take on the duties necessary to continue growing our company and pursuing our business strategy. If we cannot attract and retain skilled personnel, as needed, we may not achieve our development and other goals.\nIn addition, the success of our business will depend on our ability to develop and maintain relationships with respected service providers and industry-leading consultants and advisers. If we cannot develop and maintain such relationships, as needed, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates may be limited. In addition, our outsourcing strategy, which has included engaging consultants to manage key functional areas, may subject us to scrutiny under labor laws and regulations, which may divert management time and attention and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nA breakdown or breach of our information technology systems or data security could subject us to liability, cybersecurity risks or interrupt the operation of our business.\nCompanies are subject to a wide variety of cybersecurity attacks on their information technology systems, which we use to maintain proprietary and confidential information. Our key business partners and third-party vendors face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems and data to operate our business. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of our technology systems and data, which includes use of cloud technologies. Breakdowns, cyberattacks, corruptions, invasion, destruction, breaches of our technology systems or those of our business partners, unauthorized access to our data or other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology systems and data could subject us to liability, negatively impact our business operations or require replacement of technology. Our technology systems and those of our partners continue to increase in multitude and complexity, increasing our vulnerability to cybersecurity risks. Data privacy or security breaches also pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, vendors or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency and sophistication, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect when they impact vendors, third-party partners or other companies in our supply chain.\nIn addition, our increased use of cloud technologies heightens these and other operational risks, and any failure by cloud or other technology service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyberattacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential or propriety information. While we continue to build and improve our systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems. The loss of critical or sensitive information could result in financial, legal, operational or reputational harm to us, or loss of our competitive advantage. Our liability insurance may or may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.\nFailure to develop and maintain adequate financial controls could cause us to have material weaknesses, which could adversely affect our operations and financial position.\nWe might in the future discover material weaknesses that require remediation. In addition, an internal control system, no matter how well-designed, cannot provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we might not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports filed\nwith the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers, and employees, entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not be effective, however, in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, that our internal controls are perceived as inadequate, or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline.\nWe currently rely significantly on third parties to conduct our nonclinical testing and clinical studies and other aspects of our development programs. If those third parties do not satisfactorily perform their contractual obligations or meet anticipated deadlines, the development of our product candidates could be adversely affected.\nWe do not currently employ personnel or possess the facilities necessary to conduct many of the activities associated with our development programs. We engage consultants, advisors, clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), contract manufacturing organizations (\u201cCMOs\u201d) and others to assist in the design and conduct of nonclinical and clinical studies of our product candidates, with interpretation of the results of those studies and with regulatory activities and expect to continue to outsource all or a significant amount of such activities. As a result, many important aspects of our development programs are and will continue to be outside our direct control and our third-party service providers may not perform their activities as required or expected, including the maintenance of Good Laboratory Practices (\u201cGLP\u201d) or Good Clinical Practices (\u201cGCP\u201d) compliance, which are ultimately our responsibility to ensure. Further, such third parties may not be as committed to the success of our programs as our own employees and, therefore, may not devote the same time, thoughtfulness or creativity to completing projects or problem-solving as our own employees would. To the extent we are unable to successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe CROs that we engage or may engage to execute our clinical studies play a significant role in the conduct of the studies, including the collection and analysis of study data, and we likely will depend on CROs and clinical investigators to conduct future clinical studies and to assist in analyzing data from completed studies and developing regulatory strategies for our product candidates. Individuals working at the CROs with which we contract, as well as investigators at the sites at which our studies are conducted, are not our employees, and we have limited control over the amount or timing of resources that they devote to their programs. If our CROs, study investigators, and/or third-party sponsors fail to devote sufficient time and resources to studies of our product candidates, if we and/or our CROs do not comply with all GLP and GCP regulatory and contractual requirements, or if their performance is substandard, it could adversely affect the development of our product candidates.\nIn addition, the third parties we engage may have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. Through intentional or unintentional means, our competitors may benefit from lessons learned on the project that could ultimately harm our competitive position. Moreover, if a CRO fails to properly, or at all, perform our activities during a clinical study, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs on acceptable terms or in a timely manner, or at all. Switching CROs may increase costs and divert management time and attention. In addition, there likely would be a transition period before a new CRO commences work. These challenges could result in delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical studies, which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired and/or announced development timelines and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nWe do not have, and do not have plans to establish, manufacturing facilities. We completely rely on third parties for the manufacture and supply of our clinical trial drug supplies and, if approved, commercial product materials. The loss of any of these manufacturers or a manufacturer\u2019s failure to provide us with an adequate supply of clinical trial or commercial product material in a timely manner and on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, could harm our business.\nWe outsource the manufacture of our product candidates and do not plan to establish our own manufacturing facilities. To manufacture our product candidates, we have contracted with numerous clinical manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, making us highly dependent on these CMOs. For clinical and commercial supplies, if approved, we have or plan to have clinical supply agreements with third party CMOs for drug substance and finished drug product. While we have existing clinical supply agreements with third party CMOs, we would need to negotiate agreements for commercial supply with\nseveral CMOs and we may not be able to reach agreement on acceptable terms. In addition, we rely on these third parties to conduct or assist us in key manufacturing development activities, including qualification of equipment, developing and validating methods, defining critical process parameters, releasing component materials and conducting stability testing, among other things. If these third parties are unable to perform their tasks successfully in a timely manner, whether for technical, financial or other reasons, we may be unable to secure clinical trial material, or commercial supply material if approved, which likely would delay the initiation, conduct or completion of our clinical studies or prevent us from having enough commercial supply material for sale, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nCurrently, we do not have alternative CMOs to back up our primary vendors of clinical trial material or, if approved, commercial supply material. Identification of and discussions with other CMOs may be protracted and/or unsuccessful, or these new CMOs may be unsuccessful in producing the same results as the current primary CMOs producing the material. Therefore, if our primary CMOs become unable or unwilling to perform their required activities, we could experience protracted delays or interruptions in the supply of clinical trial material and, ultimately, product for commercial sale, which would materially and adversely affect our development programs, commercial activities, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the FDA or regulatory authorities outside of the United States may require us to have an alternate manufacturer of a drug product before approving any product candidate for marketing and sale in the United States or abroad and securing such alternate manufacturer, if possible, could result in considerable additional time and cost prior to approval.\nAny new manufacturer or supplier of finished drug product or our component materials, including drug substance and delivery devices, would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual property laws to the method of manufacturing of such product or ingredients required by us. The FDA or foreign regulatory agency may require us to conduct additional clinical studies, collect stability data and provide additional information concerning any new supplier, or change in a validated manufacturing process, including scaling-up production, before we could distribute products from that manufacturer or supplier or use the revised process.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling-up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing and shortages of qualified personnel. Our product candidates have not been manufactured at the scale we believe will be necessary to maximize their commercial value, and accordingly, we may encounter difficulties in attempting to scale-up production and may not succeed in that effort on a timely basis or at all.\nAll manufacturers of our clinical trial material and, if approved, commercial product, including drug substance manufacturers, must comply with Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cGMP\u201d) requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program and applicable requirements of foreign regulatory authorities. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our clinical trial material may be unable to comply with these GMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. While we or our representatives generally monitor and audit our manufacturers\u2019 systems, we do not have full control over their ongoing compliance with these regulations. And while the responsibility to maintain GMP compliance is shared between the third-party manufacturer and us, we bear ultimate responsibility for our supply chain and compliance with regulatory standards. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay or failure to obtain product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval.\nIn addition, any delay or interruption in the supply of materials necessary or useful to manufacture our product candidates could delay the completion of our clinical studies, increase the costs associated with our development programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical studies at significant additional expense or terminate the studies completely. Delays or interruptions in the supply of commercial product could result in increased cost of goods sold and lost sales. In addition, if our products are manufactured entirely or partially outside the United States, we may experience interruptions in supply due to shipping or customs difficulties or regional instability. Furthermore, changes in currency exchange rates, shipping costs and import tariffs could adversely affect our cost of goods sold. Any of the above factors could cause us to delay or suspend anticipated or ongoing trials, regulatory submissions or commercialization of our product candidates, entail higher costs or result in us being unable to effectively commercialize our products. Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our clinical trial materials and, if approved, commercial supply material may adversely affect our future costs and our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe currently have limited marketing capabilities and no sales organization. If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities on our own or through third parties, we will be unable to successfully commercialize our products, if approved, or generate product revenue.\nTo commercialize our products, if approved, in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we may seek approvals, we must build our marketing, sales, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services and we may not be successful in doing so. If our products receive regulatory approval, we expect to market such products in the United States through a focused, specialized sales force, which will be costly and time consuming to implement on our own. Despite the experience of individual members of management, we have limited experience as a company in the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. We recently hired a Chief Commercial Officer, who will lead our efforts to commercialize our robust pipeline of product candidates. Outside of the United States, we may consider collaboration arrangements. If we are unable to implement our own sales and marketing capability, or are unable to contract with one or more third parties for such services on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products in certain markets. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal or external sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our products. If we are not successful in commercializing our products, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we would incur significant additional losses.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or adverse events, or have other properties that could delay or prevent their clinical development, regulatory approval or commercialization.\nAs with many pharmaceutical products, undesirable side effects or adverse events caused by our product candidates could interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all indications, and in turn prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. If undesirable side effects occur, they could possibly prevent approval, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nIf any of our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product, regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication or we may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical studies or change the labeling of the product. Depending on the severity of the side effects, regulatory authorities may withdraw approval of the product. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant or any revenue from its sale.\nIn addition, in January 2021, we instituted an Expanded Access Program for Larazotide. Information obtained from our Expanded Access Program may not reliably predict the efficacy of our product candidates in company-sponsored clinical trials and may lead to adverse events that could limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval with labeling that we consider desirable, or at all.\nRisks Related to Drug Development and Commercialization\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our drug candidates.\nClinical studies are expensive, difficult to design and implement, may take many years to complete and outcomes are inherently uncertain. A drug product may fail to demonstrate positive results at any stage of testing despite having progressed satisfactorily through nonclinical testing and initial clinical studies. There is significant risk in clinical development where later stage clinical studies are designed and powered based on the analysis of data from earlier studies, with these earlier studies involving a smaller number of patients and the results of the earlier studies being driven primarily by a subset of responsive patients. Success in pre-clinical studies or completed clinical trials does not ensure that later studies or trials, including continuing pre-clinical studies and large-scale clinical trials, will be successful nor does it predict future results.\nFavorable results in early studies or trials may not be repeated in later studies or trials, and product candidates in later stage trials may fail to show acceptable safety and efficacy despite having progressed through earlier trials. There is typically a high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. We may be required to demonstrate through large, long-term outcome trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in a broad population prior to obtaining regulatory approval.\nIn addition, the placebo rate in larger studies may be higher than expected and some participants in our clinical trials may respond positively to placebo treatment - these participants are commonly known as \u201cplacebo responders\u201d - making it more difficult to demonstrate efficacy of the trial drug compared to placebo.\nFurther, clinical study data is frequently susceptible to varying interpretations. Medical professionals and/or regulatory authorities may analyze or weigh study data differently than the sponsor company, resulting in delay or failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate. Additionally, the possible lack of standardization across multiple investigative sites may induce variability in the results, which can interfere with the evaluation of treatment effects.\nIf any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in any clinical trial, we will experience potentially significant delays and cost increases in, or may decide to abandon development of, that product candidate. If we abandon or are delayed, or experience increased costs, in our development efforts related to any of our product candidates, we may not have sufficient resources to continue or complete development of that product candidate or any other product candidates. We may not be able to generate any revenues, continue our operations and clinical studies, or become profitable. Our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be significantly damaged. Further, it might not be possible for us to raise funds in the public or private markets, and our stock price would likely decrease significantly.\nDelays in commencement and completion of clinical studies are common and have many causes. Delays in clinical studies of our product candidates could increase overall development costs and jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize any approved products.\nClinical studies may not commence on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022delays in recruiting and enrolling individuals to participate in a clinical study, which historically can be challenging in orphan diseases, which is made more difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022inability to raise sufficient funding to initiate or to continue a clinical study;\n\u2022delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical study;\n\u2022delays in identifying and reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical study sites and investigators, which agreements can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among study sites;\n\u2022delays in obtaining regulatory approval in a prospective country;\n\u2022delays in obtaining ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical study at a prospective site;\n\u2022delays in reaching agreements on acceptable terms with prospective CMOs or other vendors for the production and supply of clinical trial material and, if necessary, drug administration devices, which agreements can be subject to extensive negotiation;\n\u2022delays in the production or delivery of sufficient quantities of clinical trial material from our CMOs and other vendors to initiate or continue a clinical study;\n\u2022delays due to product candidate recalls as a result of stability failure, excessive product complaints or other failures of the product candidate during its use or testing;\n\u2022invalidation of clinical data caused by premature unblinding or integrity issues;\n\u2022invalidation of clinical data caused by mixing up of the active drug and placebo through randomization or manufacturing errors;\n\u2022delays on the part of our CROs, CMOs and other third-party contractors in developing procedures and protocols or otherwise conducting activities in accordance with applicable policies and procedures and in accordance with agreed upon timelines;\n\u2022delays in identifying and hiring or engaging, as applicable, additional employees or consultants to assist in managing clinical study-related activities;\n\u2022delays caused by patients dropping out of a clinical study due to side effects, concurrent disorders, difficulties in adhering to the study protocol, unknown issues related to different patient profiles than in previous studies, or otherwise;\n\u2022delays in having patients complete participation in a clinical study, including returning for post-treatment follow-up, which is made more difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022delays resulting from study sites dropping out of a trial, providing inadequate staff support for the study, problems with shipment of study supplies to clinical sites, or focusing our staff\u2019s efforts on enrolling studies that compete for the same patient population;\n\u2022suspension of enrollment at a study site or the imposition of a clinical hold by the FDA or other regulatory authority following an inspection of clinical study operations at study sites or finding of a drug-related serious adverse event; and\n\u2022delays in quality control/quality assurance procedures necessary for study database lock and analysis of unblinded data.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of a clinical study, if a clinical study is terminated, or if failure to conduct a study in accordance with regulatory requirements or the study\u2019s protocol leads to deficient safety and/or efficacy data, the regulatory approval and/or commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue, if any, will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical studies likely will increase our development costs. Further, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical studies may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nWe may experience difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, which may delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval.\nWe may not be able to commence or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. In particular, some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for drug candidates that treat the same indications as our drug candidates and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 drug candidates.\nPatient enrollment, a critical component to successful completion of a clinical study, is affected by many factors, including:\n\u2022during the COVID-19 pandemic, the tendency of patients to avoid or their inability to travel to healthcare facilities and physicians\u2019 offices unless due to a health emergency;\n\u2022during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare site closures because of infected staff;\n\u2022the size of the target patient population;\n\u2022other ongoing studies competing for the same patient population;\n\u2022the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial;\n\u2022the design of the clinical study;\n\u2022the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022the frequency of or difficulty in administering our product candidates; and\n\u2022the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment.\nUse of our proprietary patient-reported outcome measure, CeD PRO, in our CeDLara Phase 3 clinical trial of larazotide might adversely impact our ability to achieve a positive result from this clinical trial.\nPatient-reported outcome assessments (\u201cPROs\u201d) involve patients\u2019 subjective assessments of efficacy and this subjectivity can increase the uncertainty of clinical trial outcomes. Such assessments can be influenced by a number of factors and can vary widely from day to day for a particular patient, and from patient to patient and site to site within a clinical trial, leading to high variability in PRO measurements.\nThe variability of PRO measures and high placebo response rates could adversely impact our Phase 3 CeDLara clinical trial of larazotide for celiac disease. The variability of a PRO measure can complicate clinical trial design, adversely impact the ability of a study to show a statistically significant improvement and generally adversely impact a clinical development program by introducing additional uncertainties.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding the regulatory approval process for any investigational new drug, and substantial further testing and validation of our product candidates and related manufacturing processes may be required, and regulatory approval may be conditioned, delayed or denied, any of which could delay or prevent us from successfully marketing our product candidates and substantially harm our business.\nPharmaceutical products generally are subject to rigorous nonclinical testing and clinical studies and other approval procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Various federal and foreign statutes and regulations also govern or materially influence the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing of pharmaceutical products. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate U.S. and foreign statutes and regulations is time-consuming and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.\nSignificant uncertainty exists with respect to the regulatory approval process for any new drug candidate. Regardless of any guidance the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may provide a drug\u2019s sponsor during its development, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies retain complete discretion in deciding whether to accept an NDA or the equivalent foreign regulatory approval submission for filing or, if accepted, approve an NDA. There are many components to an NDA or marketing authorization application submission in addition to clinical study data. Before accepting an NDA for review or before approving the NDA, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may request that we provide additional information that may require significant resources and time to generate and there is no guarantee that our product candidates will be approved for any indication for which we may apply. The FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may choose not to approve an NDA for a variety of reasons, including a decision related to the safety or efficacy data, manufacturing controls or systems, or for any other issues that the agency may identify related to the development of our product candidates. In addition, regulations may be changed prior to submission of an NDA that require higher hurdles than currently anticipated. Even if one or more Phase 3 clinical studies are successful in providing statistically significant evidence of the efficacy and safety of the investigational drug, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may not consider efficacy and safety data from the submitted studies adequate scientific support for a conclusion of effectiveness and/or safety and may require one or more additional Phase 3 or other studies prior to granting marketing approval. If this were to occur, the overall development cost for our product candidate would be substantially greater and our competitors may bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to generate revenues from the product candidates, or even seek approval, if blocked by a competitor\u2019s Orphan Drug exclusivity, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, development of our product candidates and/or regulatory approval may be delayed for reasons beyond our control. For example, a U.S. federal government shut-down or budget sequestration, such as ones that occurred during 2013, 2018 and 2019, may result in significant reductions to the FDA\u2019s budget, employees and operations, or the FDA may delay face-to-face meetings for an extended period of time due to COVID-19, which may lead to slower response times and longer review periods, potentially affecting our ability to progress development of our product candidates or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nIn 2019, we started the Phase 3 CeDLara clinical trial for larazotide, the success of which will be needed for FDA approval to market larazotide in the United States to treat CeD in patients with persistent symptoms while adhering to a gluten-free diet. While significant communication with the FDA on the Phase 3 study design has occurred, even if the Phase 3 clinical study meets all of its statistical goals and protocol end points, the FDA may not view the results as robust and convincing and may require additional clinical studies and/or other costly studies, which could require us to expend substantial additional resources and could significantly extend the timeline for clinical development prior to market approval. Additionally, we are required by the FDA to conduct a long-term safety study on larazotide. The results of this study will not be known until a short time prior to potential submission of an NDA for larazotide. If the safety study cannot be completed for technical or other reasons, or provides results that the FDA determines to be concerning, this may cause a delay or failure in obtaining approval for larazotide.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, we may face regulatory difficulties that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if initial regulatory approval is obtained, as a condition to the initial approval, the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency may impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or marketing surveillance programs, any of which would limit the commercial potential of the product. Our product candidates also will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements related to the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information regarding the product. For instance, the FDA may require changes to approved drug\nlabels, require post-approval clinical studies and impose distribution and use restrictions on certain drug products. In addition, approved products, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are subject to continuing regulatory review and periodic inspections. If previously unknown problems with a product are discovered, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, the FDA may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If one of our CMOs or we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022issue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022impose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022suspend or terminate any ongoing clinical studies;\n\u2022close the facilities of a CMO;\n\u2022refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022exclude our product from reimbursement under government healthcare programs, including Medicaid or Medicare;\n\u2022impose restrictions or affirmative obligations on our or our CMOs\u2019 operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nIf any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval fails to achieve significant market acceptance among the medical community, patients or third-party payers, the revenue we generate from our sales will be limited and our business may not be profitable.\nOur success will depend in substantial part on the extent to which our product candidates, if approved, are accepted by the medical community and patients and reimbursed by third-party payers, including government payers. We cannot predict whether physicians, patients, healthcare insurers or health maintenance organizations, or the medical community in general, will accept or utilize any of our products, if approved. If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by these parties, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become or to remain profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payers regarding the benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nThe degree of market acceptance with respect to each of our approved products, if any, will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the safety and efficacy of our product as demonstrated in clinical studies;\n\u2022acceptance in the medical and patient communities of our product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022the perceived advantages of our product over alternative treatments, including with respect to the incidence and severity of any adverse side effects and the cost of treatment;\n\u2022the indications for which our product is approved;\n\u2022claims or other information (including limitations or warnings) in our product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022reimbursement and coverage policies of government and other third-party payers;\n\u2022smaller than expected market size due to lack of disease awareness of a rare disease, or the patient population with a specific rare disease being smaller than anticipated;\n\u2022availability of alternative treatments;\n\u2022pricing and cost-effectiveness of our product relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022inappropriate diagnostic efforts due to limited knowledge and/or resources among clinicians;\n\u2022the prevalence of off-label substitution of chemically equivalent products or alternative treatments; and\n\u2022the resources we devote to marketing our product and restrictions on promotional claims we can make with respect to the product.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market one or more of our product candidates in the United States, we may never receive approval or commercialize our products outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize the full commercial potential of our product candidates.\nIn order to market products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with the numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries generally differs from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in\nother countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States, as well as other risks. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States. As described above, such effects include the risks that our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested, which could limit the uses of our product candidates and have an adverse effect on product sales, and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or require costly, post-marketing follow-up studies.\nConversely, even if our product candidates receive approval outside the United States in the future, we may still be unable to meet the FDA requirements necessary for approval in the United States.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication in lieu of other opportunities and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we intend to focus on developing product candidates for specific indications that we identify as most likely to succeed, in terms of their potential both to gain regulatory approval and to achieve commercialization. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or in other indications with greater commercial potential. We currently intend to focus our limited financial and managerial resources on developing our lead programs, vurolenatide, for the treatment of SBS, and larazotide, for the treatment of CeD. As a result, we may allocate fewer resources to the other product candidates in our pipeline, and we will be required to seek additional sources of financing to pursue further development of such other product candidates.\nOur resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to the product candidate.\nWe may choose not to continue developing any of our product candidates at any time during development and for any reason, which would reduce or eliminate our potential return on investment for those product candidates.\nAt any time, we may decide to discontinue the development of any of our product candidates for a variety of reasons, including inadequate financial resources, the appearance of new technologies that render our product candidates obsolete, competition from a competing product or changes in or failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. If we terminate a program in which we have invested significant resources, we will not receive any return on our investment and we will have missed the opportunity to allocate those resources to potentially more productive uses.\nAs an example, in connection with the merger with RDD and the acquisition of Naia in April 2020, and the subsequent acquisition of certain assets from Lobesity, LLC (\u201cLobesity\u201d) in July 2021, we shifted our focus and cash resources to the development of larazotide, for treatment of CeD, vurolenatide for treatment of SBS, NM-136 for the treatment of rare obesity disorders, and NM-003, NM-102 and NM-004, three candidates for undisclosed rare and/or orphan diseases.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining effective patent and other intellectual property protection for our product candidates and proprietary technology.\nWe rely on patents and other intellectual property to maintain exclusivity for our product candidates. Our success will depend in part on our ability to:\n\u2022comply with the obligations of our existing and any future license agreements;\n\u2022obtain and maintain patents and other exclusivity with respect to our products;\n\u2022prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights;\n\u2022maintain proprietary know-how and trade secrets;\n\u2022operate without infringing upon the patents and proprietary rights of others; and\n\u2022obtain and maintain appropriate licenses to patents or proprietary rights held by third parties if infringement would otherwise occur or if necessary to secure exclusive rights to them, both in the United States and in foreign countries.\nThe patent and intellectual property positions of biopharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have been and continue to be the subject of much litigation. There is no guarantee that we have or will develop or obtain the rights to products or processes that are patentable, that patents will issue from any pending applications or that claims issued will be sufficient to protect the technology we develop or have developed or that is used by us, our CMOs or our other service providers. In addition, any patents that are issued and/or licensed to us may be limited in scope or challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, including by our competitors and any rights we have under issued and/or licensed patents may not provide competitive advantages to us. If competitors can develop and commercialize technology and products similar to ours, our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nPatent applications in the United States are confidential for a period of time until they are published, and publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months. As a result, we cannot be certain that the inventors listed in any patent or patent application owned or licensed by us were the first to conceive of the inventions covered by such patents and patent applications (for U.S. patent applications filed before March 16, 2013), or that such inventors were the first to file patent applications for such inventions outside the United States on and after March 16, 2013, in the United States. In addition, changes in or different interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign countries may affect our patent rights and limit the patents we can obtain, which could permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and to commercialize our technology and products without any compensation to us.\nWe also rely on unpatented know-how and trade secrets and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators and others. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and certain consultants. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights, however, may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of or otherwise protect our proprietary information or prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such misappropriation or infringement. In addition, it is possible that inventions relevant to our business could be developed by a person not bound by an invention assignment agreement with us or independently discovered by a competitor.\nWe also intend to rely on regulatory exclusivity for protection of any of our product candidates that may be approved for commercial sale. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or to maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect for our product candidates, if approved, could affect our decision on whether to market the products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our revenue or results of operations.\nWe may rely on trademarks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our product candidates, if approved, from the products of our competitors. However, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks, in which case we may expend substantial resources to defend our proposed or approved trademarks and may enter into agreements with third parties that may limit our use of our trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote significant resources to advertising and marketing these new brands. Further, our competitors may infringe our trademarks or we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, we could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and commercializing our product candidates.\nLarazotide, vurolenatide, NM-136, NM-003, and NM-004 are covered by several issued patents in the U.S., issued patents outside the U.S. and with patent applications pending in several jurisdictions. Intellectual property relating to the larazotide program is exclusively licensed from Alba Therapeutics Corp. (\u201cAlba\u201d). Additionally, we have collaborated with EBRIS to study larazotide for the treatment of MIS-C. Intellectual property relating to the vurolenatide and NM-003 programs, specifically the lead molecules GLP-1 and GLP-2 along with a related XTEN sequence, are exclusively licensed from Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cAmunix\u201d). Additionally, intellectual property for the rights to GLP-1 Agonist for the\ntreatment of SBS, related to the vurolenatide program, is licensed from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (\u201cCedars\u201d). Intellectual property relating to NM-004 program is exclusively licensed from Seachaid Pharmaceuticals Inc. (\u201cSeachaid\u201d). Intellectual property for the rights to a proprietary and highly specific humanized monoclonal antibody that targets glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, related to the NM-136 program were acquired from Lobesity. Our license agreements with Alba, Amunix, Cedars and Seachaid, and our asset purchase agreement with Lobesity impose, and any future licenses or collaboration agreements we enter into are likely to impose, various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, patent prosecution and enforcement and other obligations on us. These type of agreements and related obligations are complex and subject to contractual disputes. If we breach any of these imposed obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages or the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in our loss of the intellectual property rights and us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell drugs that are covered by the licensed technology, which loss may materially harm our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to prevent competitors from duplicating or developing and commercializing equivalent versions of our product candidates, and intellectual property protection may not be sufficient or effective to exclude this competition.\nWe have patent protection in the United States and other countries to cover the composition of matter, formulation and method of use for larazotide, vurolenatide, NM-136, NM-003 and NM-004. However, these patents may not provide us with significant competitive advantages, because the validity, scope, term, or enforceability of the patents may be challenged and, if instituted, one or more of the challenges may be successful. Patents may be challenged in the United States under post-grant review proceedings, inter partes reexamination, ex parte reexamination, or challenged in district court. Any patents issued in foreign jurisdictions may be subjected to comparable proceedings lodged in various foreign patent offices or courts. These proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent. Even if a patent issues, and is held valid and enforceable, competitors may be able to design around our patent rights, such as by using pre-existing or newly developed technology, in which case competitors may not infringe our issued claims and may be able to market and sell products that compete directly with ours before and after our patents expire. Further, the larazotide primary end point is the CeD PRO that is protected by copyright until 2106. However, copyright protection may not be sufficient to exclude others from developing products that compete with larazotide.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming. We and any of our future licensors and licensees may not apply for or prosecute patents on certain aspects of our product candidates at a reasonable cost, in a timely fashion, or at all. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of some patent applications related to our product candidates or technologies. As a result, these patents and patent applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with our best interests. It is also possible that we or any of our future or present licensors or licensees will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Further, it is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, assignment, term or claim scope. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid or unenforceable. In addition, one or more parties may independently develop similar technologies or methods, duplicate our technologies or methods, or design around the patented aspects of our products, technologies or methods. Any of these circumstances could impair our ability to protect our products, if approved, in ways which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurthermore, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in and outside of the United States. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to use our patents to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical products or technology, or to limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and drugs. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar to or identical to ours.\nEnforcement of intellectual property rights in certain countries outside the United States, including China in particular, has been limited or non-existent. Future enforcement of patents and proprietary rights in many other countries will likely be problematic or unpredictable. Moreover, the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a similar\npatent in another country. Claim interpretation and infringement laws vary by nation, so the extent of any patent protection is uncertain and may vary in different jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and applications are required to be paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process and after a patent has issued. There are situations in which non-compliance can result in decreased patent term or in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, leading to partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.\nThird parties may claim that our products, if approved, infringe on their proprietary rights and may challenge the approved use or uses of a product or our patent rights through litigation or administrative proceedings, and defending such actions may be costly and time consuming, divert management attention away from our business and result in an unfavorable outcome that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability and the ability of our CMOs to develop, manufacture, receive approval for, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products. Because patent applications can take many years to publish and issue, there currently may be pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that our products, product candidates or technologies infringe, or that the process of manufacturing our product candidates, infringe, or that the use of our product candidates or technologies infringe.\nWe and our CMOs may be exposed to, or threatened with, litigation by third parties alleging that our products, product candidates and/or technologies infringe their patents and/or other intellectual property rights, or that one or more of the processes for manufacturing our product candidates or the use of our product candidates or technologies, infringe their patents and/or other intellectual property rights. If a third-party patent or other intellectual property right is found to cover our product candidates, technologies or uses, or any of the underlying manufacturing processes, we could be required to pay damages and could be unable to commercialize our product candidates or to use our technologies or methods unless we are able to obtain a license to the patent or intellectual property right. A license may not be available to us in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, during litigation, the third party alleging infringement could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable remedy that could prohibit us from making, using, selling or importing our products, technologies or methods.\nThere generally is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the industries in which we operate and the cost of such litigation may be considerable. We can provide no assurance that our product candidates or technologies will not infringe patents or rights owned by others, licenses to which may not be available to us in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all. If a third party claims that we or our CMOs or component material suppliers infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022infringement and other intellectual property claims which, with or without merit, may be expensive and time consuming to litigate and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our core business;\n\u2022substantial damages for infringement, including the potential for treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, which we may have to pay if it is determined that the product and/or its use at issue infringes or violates the third party\u2019s rights;\n\u2022a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing the product unless the third-party licenses its intellectual property rights to us, which it may not be required to do;\n\u2022if a license is available from the third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to the third party; and\n\u2022redesigning our products or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial expense and time.\nNo assurance can be given that patents do not exist, have not been filed, or could not be filed or issued, which contain claims covering our product candidates or technology or those of our CMOs or component material suppliers or the use of our product candidates or technologies. Because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in the industries in which we operate, there is a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our product candidates or technologies, or those of our CMOs, or uses of our product candidates or technologies.\nIn the future, it may be necessary for us to enforce our proprietary rights, or to determine the scope, validity and unenforceability of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights, through litigation or other dispute proceedings, which may be costly and, to the extent we are unsuccessful, adversely affect our rights. In these proceedings, a court or administrative body could determine that our claims, including those related to enforcing patent rights, are not valid or that an alleged infringer has not infringed our rights. The uncertainty resulting from the mere institution and continuation of any patent or other proprietary rights-related litigation or interference proceeding could have a material and adverse effect on our business prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe are subject to uncertainty relating to healthcare reform measures and reimbursement policies that, if not favorable to our products, could hinder or prevent our products\u2019 commercial success, if any of our product candidates are approved.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, such as Medicare, private health insurers and other organizations establish what we believe to be appropriate coverage and reimbursement for our approved products. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payer coverage and reimbursement could negatively affect the market acceptance of our product candidates and the future revenues we may expect to receive from any approved products. The commercial success of our product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which the costs of such products will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and other organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, we may not obtain coverage for our products after approval as a benefit under the third-party payers\u2019 plans or, even if we do, the level of coverage or payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status for newly approved drug products, including coding, coverage and payment. There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payers in the United States; therefore coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer. The coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate payment will be applied consistently or obtained. The process for determining whether a payer will cover and how much it will reimburse a product may be separate from the process of seeking approval of the product or for setting the price of the product. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use. Third-party payer reimbursement to providers of our products, if approved, may be subject to a bundled payment that also includes the procedure of administering our products or third-party payers may require providers to perform additional patient testing to justify the use of our products. To the extent there is no separate payment for our products, there may be further uncertainty as to the adequacy of reimbursement amounts.\nThe containment of healthcare costs is a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drug products have been a focus in this effort. The continuing efforts of government, private insurance companies and other organizations to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect our ability to set as high a price for our products as we might otherwise and the rate and scope of adoption of our products by healthcare providers. We expect that federal, state and local governments in the United States, as well as governments in other countries, will continue to consider legislation directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of drug products is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable or insufficient. It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or abroad, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions governmental or private payers for healthcare treatment and services may take in response to any such healthcare reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive\npolicies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.\nThese potential courses of action are unpredictable and the potential impact of new legislation on our operations and financial position is uncertain, but may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, lower reimbursement and additional downward pressure on the price we may receive for an approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products, if approved.\nAny fast track designation or grant of priority review status by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, nor will it assure FDA approval of our product candidates. Additionally, our product candidates may treat indications that do not qualify for priority review vouchers.\nWe have received fast track designation for larazotide for the treatment of CeD. We may seek fast track designation for some of our other product candidates or priority review of applications for approval of our product candidates for certain indications. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. If a product candidate offers major advances in treatment, the FDA may designate it eligible for priority review. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant these designations, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for these designations, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant them. Even with the fast track designation for larazotide and if we do receive fast track designation or priority review for any other product candidate, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation from larazotide or any other product candidate to be so designated if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nIntense competition might render our gastroenterology products noncompetitive or obsolete.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical industry in general and in our therapeutic sectors in particular is intense and characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. Technological developments by competitors, regulatory approval for marketing competitive products, including potential generic or over-the-counter products, or superior marketing resources possessed by competitors could adversely affect the commercial potential of our gastroenterology product candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and results of operations. We believe that there are numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic research groups throughout the world, engaged in research and development efforts with respect to pharmaceutical products targeted at gastroenterological diseases and conditions addressed by our product pipeline. Developments by others might render our product pipeline obsolete or noncompetitive. Competitors might be able to complete the development and regulatory approval process sooner and, therefore, market their gastroenterology products earlier than we can.\nMany of our current competitors have significant financial, marketing and personnel resources and development capabilities. For example, many large, well-capitalized companies already offer gastroenterology products and services in the United States and Europe that target the indications for: (i) SBS including acid suppressive therapies such as H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors; antidiarrheals such as loperamide; antibiotics to prevent small intestinal bacterial overgrowth; octreotide for patient with IV fluid requirements greater than 3 liters per day; clonidine; GLP-1 analogues including exenatide with or without GLP-2 analogues such as teduglutide (Gattex\u00ae); human growth hormone or somatropin analogues (Zorptive\u00ae); bile acid binders such as cholestyramine or pancreatic enzymes to aid in digestion of nutrients; and (ii) CeD including methods to improve adherence to a gluten-free diet.\nWe might not receive all of the anticipated market exclusivity benefits of orphan drug designations.\nVurolenatide, a long-acting injectable GLP-1 analogue being developed for SBS and NM-003, a long-acting glucagon-like receptor-2 agonist that utilizes our proprietary XTEN technology to extend circulating half-life for the prevention of acute graft versus host disease, have each received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation may provide market exclusivity in the U.S. for seven years if (1) vurolenatide receives market approval before a competitor using a similar mechanism for the same indication, (2) we are able to produce sufficient supply to meet demand in the marketplace, and (3) another product with the same active ingredient is not deemed clinically superior.\nNM-003, NM-102 and NM-004 are being evaluated for development in other rare and/or orphan indications via an ongoing probability of technical and regulatory success analysis.\nObtaining an Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA may not effectively protect our product candidates from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition, and orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving the same or a different drug in another indication. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a later application for the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer in a substantial portion of the target populations, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, a designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Moreover, orphan-drug-exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nWe face potential product liability exposures, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization. In the future, we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional or increased product liability insurance coverage and we are uncertain whether such increased or additional insurance coverage can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur business (in particular, the use of our product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval) will expose us to product liability risks. Product liability claims may be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or involved in the use of our product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022significant costs of related litigation;\n\u2022impairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022a \u201cclinical hold,\u201d suspension or termination of a clinical study or amendments to a study design;\n\u2022delays in enrolling patients to participate in our clinical studies;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical study participants;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022decreased demand for our products, if approved, and loss of revenue; and\n\u2022the inability to commercialize our product candidates and any approved products.\nWe maintain limited product liability insurance for our clinical studies and our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses.\nWe expect that we will expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, but we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially acceptable terms or may not be able to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against potential losses. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drug products that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could materially decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will likely in the future be volatile.\nThe stock market in general and the market for pharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. For example, since our stock began trading under the symbol \u201cINNT\u201d, and later under \u201cNMTR\u201d, on February 1, 2018, through March 22, 2022, the price thereof has ranged from a low of $0.37 per share to a high of $50.50 per share. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors. These factors have included or may include the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022results from changes to or delays in clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022announcements of regulatory approval or disapproval of, or delays in clinical trials for, larazotide (for CeD) or vurolenatide (for SBS) or any future product candidates;\n\u2022commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022introductions and announcements of new products by us, any commercialization partners or our competitors and the timing of these introductions and announcements;\n\u2022variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, licenses, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other transactions;\n\u2022market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sectors and issuance of securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022actual or anticipated quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates or guidance, including our ability to meet our future revenue and operating profit or loss estimates or guidance;\n\u2022our liquidity position and ability to raise additional capital;\n\u2022sales of substantial amounts of our stock by insiders and other stockholders, or the expectation that such sales might occur;\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022intellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us;\n\u2022expiration or termination of our potential relationships with strategic partners;\n\u2022catastrophic weather and/or global disease pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe stock market in general has experienced relatively large price and volume fluctuations, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the market prices of securities of smaller biotechnology and medical device companies have experienced dramatic fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of these companies. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. In addition, price volatility may increase if the trading volume of our common stock remains limited or declines.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including conducting clinical trials, commercialization efforts, expanded research and development activities and costs associated with operating a public company. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to our existing stockholders.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2021, we had exercisable outstanding options and warrants (excluding out-of-the-money stock options and warrants) that if exercised would result in the issuance of 29.3 million shares of our common stock. Further, we are authorized to grant equity awards, including stock grants and stock options, to our employees, directors and consultants. As of December 31, 2021, there were 5,478,787 shares available for future issuance under the 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended (the \u201c2012 Plan\u201d). During the term of the 2012 Plan, the share reserve will automatically increase on the first trading day in January of each calendar year, by (i) five percent of the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31st of the immediately preceding calendar year or (ii) such lesser number of shares of common stock as determined by the board of directors. On January 1, 2022, on the terms of the 2012 Plan, an additional 12,911,771 shares were made available for issuance.\nWe expect to issue from time to time additional shares of our common stock and/or securities convertible into shares of our common stock to fund our operations and incentivize our employees and directors. In any such issuance, our stockholders would experience dilution and the market price of our common stock may decline.\nIf we fail to meet the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which would decrease the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain this listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements. On February 8, 2022, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Qualifications Department indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), because the minimum bid price of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market closed below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, or until August 8, 2022. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock has to meet or exceed $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days before August 8, 2022.\nWhile we intend to engage in efforts to maintain compliance, and thus maintain our listing, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements in the future. If our common stock were removed from listing with The Nasdaq Capital Market, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange, which is the exception on which we currently rely. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market.\nIf our common stock is delisted and there is no longer an active trading market for our shares, it may, among other things:\n\u2022cause you difficulty in selling your shares without depressing the market price for the shares or selling your shares at all;\n\u2022substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds;\n\u2022result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer financing opportunities for us; and/or\n\u2022result in potential breaches of representations or covenants of agreements pursuant to which we made representations or covenants relating to our compliance with applicable listing requirements. Claims related to any such breaches, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nA delisting would also reduce the value of our equity compensation plans, which could negatively impact our ability to retain key employees.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, which could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of the Company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by the stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur organizational documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including provisions that:\n\u2022provide for a classified board of directors;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on the board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022prohibit director removal without cause and only allow removal with cause;\n\u2022allow amendment of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws only by the vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of all then-outstanding shares of our common stock;\n\u2022grant the board of directors the exclusive authority to increase or decrease the size of the board;\n\u2022permit stockholders to only take actions at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022require that stockholders give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022authorize the board of directors, by a majority vote, to amend the bylaws.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that certain investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our officers, directors, employees or agents.\nOur bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company to us or our stockholders, creditors or other constituents, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine; in each case, subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein; provided that, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, such action may be brought in another state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. These choice of forum provisions do not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for any actions brought under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Accordingly, our choice of forum provisions will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. The choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees or agents, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees or agents.\nIf a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the near future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings and financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nWe will continue to seek additional funds through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, which may impose restrictions on our business.\nIn order to raise additional funds to support our operations, we will continue to seek additional funds through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, which may impose restrictive covenants that adversely impact our business. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities due to such restrictions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nWe have U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, which expire in various years if not utilized. In addition, we have federal research and development credit carryforwards. The federal research and development credit carryforwards expire in various years if not utilized. Under Sections 382 and 383 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its future post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We have not performed a formal study to determine whether any of our NOLs are subject to these limitations. We have recorded deferred tax assets for our NOLs and research and development credits and have recorded a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets. In the event that it is determined that we have in the past experienced additional ownership changes, or if we experience one or more ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, then we may be further limited in our ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn in the event that we attain profitability. Any such limitations on the ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results in the event that we attain profitability.", "PERMNO": 16178, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "NMTR"}
