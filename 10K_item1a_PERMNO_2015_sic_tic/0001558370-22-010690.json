Risk Factors\nThe following are risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K because these factors could cause actual results, performance, and achievements to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Before you invest in our publicly traded securities, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described below. Additional risks of which we may not be aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations or our stock price. If any of the risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed by us from time to time.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\n\u25cf The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u25cf Our operating history is characterized by net losses. We anticipate further losses and we may never become profitable.\n\u25cf Our recently implemented expenses reduction plan and organizational changes undertaken to align to our focus on our EaaS business and achieving profitability may not be successful.\n\u25cf If we are unable to either substantially improve our operating results or obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue to operate at current levels.\n\u25cf We may be unable to fund our future operating requirements, which could force us to curtail our operations; we were in breach of our secured note purchase agreement as of May 27, 2022.\n\u25cf A sustainable market for microturbines may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate which would adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u25cf Product quality expectations may not be met, causing slower market acceptance or warranty cost exposure.\n\u25cf Our products involve a lengthy sales cycle, and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.\n\u25cf If we do not effectively implement our sales, marketing and service plans, our sales will not grow and our results of operations will suffer.\n\u25cf Changes to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, and sanctions caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase our costs or limit the amount of raw materials and products that we can import, or may otherwise adversely impact our business.\n\u25cf We may not be able to retain or develop relationships with OEMs or distributors in our targeted markets, in which case our sales would not increase as expected.\n\u25cf If any of our distributor relationships is not successful, we may terminate or choose not to renew the related distributor agreement, which may result in interference with the wind down of the relationship or the transition of end-user service agreements and could potentially negatively impact our distribution channel or result in litigation costs or other expenses.\n\u25cf We have substantial accounts receivable and increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\n\u25cf Loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u25cf We may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.\n\u25cf We have realized reductions in our operating costs and, as a result, our ability to cut costs further and sustain our business initiatives may be limited.\n\u25cf We may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims.\n\u25cf Operational restructuring may result in asset impairment or other unanticipated charges.\n\u25cf We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, expand our production capabilities or improve our operational, financial and management information systems, which would impair our results of operations.\n\u25cf Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of management and key employees.\n\u25cf Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, and other events beyond our control.\n\u25cf Activities necessary to integrate any future acquisitions may result in costs greater than current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\n\u25cf We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements of existing products\n\u25cf Our operating results are dependent, in large part, upon the successful commercialization of our products. Failure to produce our products as scheduled and budgeted would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n\u25cf We may not be able to produce our products on a timely basis if we fail to correctly anticipate product supply requirements or if we suffer delays in production resulting from issues with our suppliers. Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient number of components or components of adequate quality, or they may provide components at significantly increased prices.\n\u25cf Commodity market factors impact our costs and availability of materials.\n\u25cf We operate in a highly competitive market among competitors that have significantly greater resources than we have and we may not be able to compete effectively.\n\u25cf Our business and financial performances depend in part on the oil and natural gas industry, where a continued movement towards clean energy and away from fossil fuels, as well as a decline in prices for oil and natural gas may have an adverse effect on our revenue, cash flows, profitability, and growth.\n\u25cf Our sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by risks inherent in international markets.\n\u25cf We may not be able to develop sufficiently trained applications engineering, installation, and service support to serve our targeted markets.\n\u25cf Changes in our product components may require us to replace parts held at distributors.\n\u25cf Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers to our entry into the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.\nRisks Related to Pending Litigation and Government Regulation\n\u25cf We operate in a highly regulated business environment, and changes in regulation could impose significant costs on us or make our products less economical, thereby affecting demand for our microturbines.\n\u25cf We have significant tax assets, usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future.\n\u25cf We may be subject to lawsuits.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\n\u25cf Our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.\n\u25cf We face security and cybersecurity risks related to our electronic processing of sensitive and confidential business and product data. If we are unable to protect our data or the data of our customers, a security breach could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u25cf We cannot be certain of the future effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over our financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports and the value of our common stock may decline.\n\u25cf Future issuances or sales of our common stock or exercises by holders of our outstanding warrants could lower our stock price and dilute the interests of existing stockholders.\n\u25cf The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.\n\u25cf If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\n\u25cf Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our NOL rights plan, as well as Delaware law, may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\n\u25cf We do not intend to pay cash dividends. We have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our securities will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u25cf Adverse economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition, including some effects we may not be able to predict.\n\u25cf Our business may be impacted by international instability, war, terrorism, and geopolitical events.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, please see below.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nThe ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAn infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) that was first detected in November 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China, known as COVID-19, resulted in an outbreak throughout the world. The subsequent spread of COVID-19 to the U.S. and many other parts of the world led the World Health Organization to characterize COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Thereafter, most U.S. states imposed \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders on their populations to stem the spread of COVID-19. Of specific interest to the Company, stay-at-home orders were imposed in the state of California on March 20, 2020. Governments, public institutions, and other organizations in countries and localities throughout the world have taken and are continuing to take certain emergency measures to combat the spread of COVID-19, including implementation of restrictions on travel and orders that restrict the operations of institutions such as schools and businesses. These conditions have negatively impacted all aspects of our business. Our business is also dependent on the continued health and productivity of our employees, including our manufacturing employees, sales staff, and corporate management teams.\nIn addition, due to domestic and international governmental orders restricting certain activities in response to COVID-19, including in Van Nuys, California, where our corporate headquarters and many of our operations, including our principal manufacturing facility, are located, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, certain disruptions in our business, including changes to our on-site operations to reduce manufacturing capacity and implement social distancing, reductions in our suppliers\u2019 ability to source, maintain inventory and ship raw materials in alignment with our demands, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, including having most of our employees working outside of our offices, travel restrictions, reduced access to our customers for product training and case support, and cancellation of events, delays in product development efforts, and other negative impacts on our capacity to manufacture, our suppliers\u2019 capacity to source and ship raw materials and our distributors\u2019 ability to sell and support the use of our products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets. Due to such volatility, we may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, on favorable terms, or at all. Further adverse economic events resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including sustained economic downturn, supply chain disruptions, or increasing cost pressures, could materially and adversely affect our business, access to capital markets and the value of our common stock.\nAdditionally, our liquidity could be negatively impacted if these conditions continue for a significant period of time and we may be required to pursue additional sources of financing to obtain working capital, maintain appropriate inventory levels, and meet our financial obligations.\nDespite the introduction of Covid-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential impacts on our business or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur operating history is characterized by net losses. We anticipate further losses and we may never become profitable.\nSince inception, we have incurred annual operating losses. We expect this trend to continue until such time that we can sell a sufficient number of units and achieve a cost structure to become profitable. Our business is such that we have relatively few repeat end use customers and limited repeat business compared to our competitors. As a result, we\nmay not maintain or increase revenue. We may not have adequate cash resources to reach the point of profitability, and we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to increase our sales and sustain or increase our profitability in the future.\nOur recently implemented expenses reduction plan and organizational changes undertaken to align to our focus on our EaaS business and achieving profitability may not be successful.\nIn March 2022, we implemented an expenses reduction plan and announced our efforts to reduce our operating costs and modify our operating model to better match our expanding EaaS business. Beginning on February 28, 2022, we furloughed 17 employees for a period of 120 days, eliminated the position of Chief Revenue Officer, which was held by Jim Crouse, effective April 15, 2022, instituted 15% temporary pay cuts for approximately 36 employees and 25% temporary pay cuts for members of our senior leadership team, among other actions.\nWe believe these changes were needed to streamline our organization and reallocate our resources to better align with our current strategic goals, including our current focus of achieving profitability and expanding our EaaS business. However, these expense reduction measures have and may continue to yield unintended consequences and costs, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, attrition beyond our intended reduction-in-force, a reduction in morale among our remaining employees, and the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, all of which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, while positions have been eliminated certain functions necessary to our reduced operations remain, particularly with respect to our financial and accounting function, and we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees or to external service providers. We may also discover that the reductions in workforce and cost cutting measures will make it difficult for us to pursue new opportunities and initiatives and require us to hire qualified replacement personnel, which may require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs and expenses. We may further discover that, despite the implementation of our expense reduction plan, we may require additional capital to continue expanding our EaaS business and we may be unable to obtain such capital. Moreover, there is no assurance we will be successful in our pursuit of expanding our EaaS business. Our failure to successfully accomplish any of the above activities and goals may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to fund our future operating requirements, which could force us to further curtail our operations; we were in breach of our secured note purchase agreement as of May 27, 2022.\nTo the extent that the funds we now have on hand are insufficient to fund our future operating requirements, we would need to raise additional funds, through further public or private equity or debt financings depending upon prevailing market conditions. These financings may not be available or, if available, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and could result in dilution to our stockholders and reduction of the trading price of our stock. The state of capital markets when we seek to raise additional capital could also impede our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If adequate capital were not available to us, we likely would be required to significantly curtail our operations or possibly even cease our operations. In March 2022, we implemented an expense reduction plan, which included furloughs, employment terminations and pay cuts. See \u201c- Our recently implemented expenses reduction plan and organizational changes undertaken to align to our focus on our EaaS business and achieving profitability may not be successful.\u201d\nWe are party to an Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement (the \u201cA&R Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) dated October 1, 2020 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d) among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. (as successor in interest to Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Holdings, Inc.), as collateral agent (\u201cGoldman\u201d or the \u201cCollateral Agent\u201d) and the purchasers party thereto (the \u201cPurchasers\u201d). The A&R Note Purchase Agreement amended and restated our Note Purchase Agreement dated February 4, 2019, by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Holdings, Inc. and the purchasers party thereto under which we sold $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) bearing an interest of 13.0% per annum. Pursuant to the A&R Note Purchase Agreement, the Company issued $20.0 million in additional Notes and all outstanding Notes under the A&R Note Purchase Agreement bear interest at the Adjusted (London Interbank Offer) LIBO Rate (as defined in the A&R Note Purchase Agreement) plus 8.75% per annum, payable on the last day of each interest period of one-, two-, three- or six-months (but, in the case of a six-month interest period, every three-months). The Notes do not amortize and the entire principal balance is due and payable on October 1, 2023. As of March 31, 2022, $51.0\nmillion in borrowings were outstanding under the Notes, which includes the accrual for an exit fee to be paid at maturity or upon pre-payment. Obligations under the A&R Note Purchase Agreement are secured by all of the Company\u2019s assets, including intellectual property and general intangibles. The A&R Note Purchase Agreement contains customary covenants, including, among others, covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt, grant liens, make certain investments and acquisitions, pay dividends, repurchase equity interests, repay certain debt, amend certain contracts, enter into affiliate transactions and asset sales or make certain equity issuances (including equity issuances that would cause an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code), and covenants that require us to, among other things, provide annual, quarterly and monthly financial statements, together with related compliance certificates, maintain our property in good repair, maintain insurance and comply with applicable laws.\nOn May 13, 2021, the Company, and the collateral agent, entered into a First Amendment, dated as of May 13, 2021 (the \u201cAmendment\u201d), to the A&R Note Purchase Agreement. The Amendment amended certain provisions of the A&R Note Purchase Agreement, including to (a) require the Company to expand its Rental Fleet (as defined in the A&R Note Purchase Agreement) by (i) at least 2.00 MW by the 9-month anniversary of the Closing Date (instead of 6.25 MW as provided in the A&R Note Purchase Agreement prior to the Amendment), and (ii) at least 12.50 MW by the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date (which is unchanged from the covenant set forth in the A&R Note Purchase Agreement prior to the Amendment), and (b) increase the Company\u2019s minimum consolidated liquidity requirement from $9 million to $12.2 million, for the period from May 13, 2021 to March 31, 2022, and $9 million thereafter. The financial covenants of the A&R Note Purchase Agreement require the Company not to exceed specified levels of Adjusted EBITDA losses relative to its financial model, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021. As of March 31, 2022, we were not in compliance with the Adjusted EBITDA covenant contained in the A&R Note Purchase Agreement and did not cure such non-compliance by prepaying the Notes. As a result, we were in breach of the Adjusted EBITDA covenant as of May 27, 2022. On July 13, 2022 we entered into the Second Amendment to the A&R Note Purchase Agreement (the \u201cA&R NPA Second Amendment\u201d) with the purchaser thereunder (the \u201cPurchaser\u201d) and Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. as collateral agent (the \u201cCollateral Agent\u201d), pursuant to which (i) the Purchaser and the Collateral Agent waived our breach of the Adjusted EBITDA covenant and (ii) the A&R Note Purchase Agreement has been amended to, among other things, add certain new covenants, including requirements that we use our commercially reasonable best efforts to both (a) raise at least $10 million through a sale of our common stock by September 14, 2022 and (b) refinance the Notes by October 1, 2022. See Item 9B \u201cOther Information\u201d for a summary of the A&R NPA Second Amendment.\nThe A&R Note Purchase Agreement, as amended, also defines an event of default as, among other things, payment default, bankruptcy events, cross defaults, breaches of covenants and representations and warranties, changes of control, judgment defaults and an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. An event of default, if not waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur obligations under the A&R Note Purchase Agreement, as amended, have important consequences, including the following:\n\u25cf We may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for operations, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes.\n\u25cf We will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on the Notes, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future acquisitions.\n\u25cf Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Holdings, Inc., as collateral agent under the Note Purchase Agreement, may enforce any and all liens and security interests on the collateral we have used to secure the Notes and we may forfeit our right to such collateral.\n\u25cf In order to avoid breaches of the Note Purchase Agreement covenant relating to Section 382 changes of ownership, we may be limited in the amount of additional equity securities we are able to sell to raise capital. Accordingly, our desire to preserve our federal and state net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive funding opportunities.\nWe may be required to repay the Notes immediately if we again default on any of the numerous financial and other covenants contained in the A&R Note Purchase Agreement, including any of those added pursuant to the A&R NPA Second Amendment, and Goldman does not waive such default. It is not certain whether we will have, or will be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make any such accelerated payments. If any outstanding indebtedness under the Notes is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to either substantially improve our operating results or obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue to operate at current levels.\nWe have experienced recurring operating losses and as of March 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $938.4 million. On March 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $22.6 million, and working capital of $35.9 million. This compares to $919.3 million, $49.5 million and $52.5 million, respectively, on March 31, 2021. As a condition of the A&R Note Purchase Agreement with the Purchasers, our consolidated liquidity (defined as the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated balance of the Company and our subsidiaries, subject to certain conditions as defined in the A&R Note Purchase Agreement) on any date may not be less than $12.2 million for the period from the Amendment Date to March 31, 2022, and $9.0 million thereafter.\nOur business strategy is focused on profitability-oriented initiatives such as reducing operating expenses, increasing sales of products and services, thereby diversifying, and increasing revenue, and improving gross margin. In particular, we are focused on expanding our Energy-as-a-Service business. We may not be able to execute our business strategy successfully and if we are unable to generate positive cash flow, potential customers may choose not to purchase our products or utilize our program. Moreover, the business strategy is based upon projections, which are in turn based upon estimates and assumptions. There can be no assurance as to the accuracy of the projections, estimates and assumptions which underlie the business strategy or as to our ability to execute the business strategy successfully.\nShould we be unable to execute our plans to increase sales and margins while controlling costs, we may be unable to continue to operate at our current levels on a longer-term basis. In particular, we must generate positive cash flow from operations and net income and otherwise improve our results of operations substantially on a longer-term basis. Our available cash and proceeds from future financings, if any, that we may be able to obtain, may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. Any such lack of funds would affect our ability to continue to operate at current levels. These events and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital and on the market value of our common stock and our ability to maintain Notes financing. Moreover, should we experience a cash shortage that requires us to curtail or cease our operations, which could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA sustainable market for microturbines may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur products represent an emerging market, and we do not know whether our targeted customers will accept our technology or will purchase our products in sufficient quantities to allow our business to grow. To succeed, demand for our products must increase significantly in existing markets, and there must be strong demand for products that we introduce in the future. In addition, as part of our business strategy, we are focusing our marketing efforts on expanding our Energy as a Service business and on the energy efficiency, renewable energy and, natural resources markets. We may be unable to grow our business in these target markets. If a sustainable market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the losses we have incurred to develop our products, we may have further impairment of assets, and we may be unable to meet our operational expenses. The development of a sustainable market for our systems may be hindered by many factors, including some that are out of our control. Examples include:\n\u25cf consumer reluctance to try a new product;\n\u25cf regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf the cost competitiveness of our microturbines;\n\u25cf costs associated with the installation and commissioning of our microturbines;\n\u25cf maintenance and repair costs associated with our microturbines;\n\u25cf the future costs and availability of fuels used by our microturbines;\n\u25cf economic downturns and reduction in capital spending;\n\u25cf consumer perceptions of our microturbines\u2019 safety and quality;\n\u25cf the emergence of newer, more competitive technologies and products;\n\u25cf growth of the Hybrid Electric Vehicle market; and\n\u25cf decrease in domestic and international incentives.\nProduct quality expectations may not be met, causing slower market acceptance or warranty cost exposure.\nIn order to achieve our goal of improving the quality and lowering the total costs of ownership of our products, we may require engineering changes. Such improvement initiatives may render existing inventories obsolete or excessive. Despite our continuous quality improvement initiatives, we may not meet customer expectations. Any significant quality issues with our products could have a material adverse effect on our rate of product adoption, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow. Moreover, as we develop new configurations for our microturbines and as our customers place existing configurations in commercial use, our products may perform below expectations. Any significant performance below expectations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow and affect the marketability of our products.\nWe sell our products with warranties. There can be no assurance that the provision for estimated product warranty will be sufficient to cover our warranty expenses in the future. We cannot ensure that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability. Any significant incurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow. Further, we have at times undertaken programs to enhance the performance of units previously sold. For example, our warranty provision was negatively impacted in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2021 because of a supplier defect identified in fielded units. In Fiscal 2021 a warranty reserve in the amount of $4.9 million was established related to reliability programs to account for the replacement of remaining high risk failure parts in some of our fielded units due to a supplier defect. These enhancements have at times been provided at no cost or below our cost. If we choose to offer such programs again in the future, such actions could result in significant costs.\nOn February 22, 2021, we announced that we had reached a financial settlement in the amount of $5 million arising out of claims pursued in confidential arbitration with such former strategic parts supplier. We obtained this settlement following a multi-year arbitration process. Any future product quality issues with our parts suppliers could lead to lengthy and costly litigation, even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor. In addition, such quality issues with any of our parts could lead to us to fail to meet the product quality expectations of our own customers, which could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow and affect the marketability of our products.\nOur products involve a lengthy sales cycle, and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.\nThe sale of our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by customers, which can result in the typical delays associated with large capital expenditures. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy and subject to several significant risks over which we have little or no control. We plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would suffer. If demand in any period increases well above anticipated levels, we may have difficulties in responding, incur greater costs to respond, or be unable to fulfill the demand in sufficient time to retain the\norder, which would negatively impact our operations. In addition, our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term. As a result of these factors, a small fluctuation in timing of sales can cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.\nNet product orders for Fiscal 2022 were $31.8 million and contributed to an ending backlog of $25.3 million at March 31, 2022. The book-to-bill ratio was 1.1:1 for Fiscal 2022. Book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of new orders we received to units shipped and billed during a period. However, because our backlog represents only the estimated amount of future product revenue to be recognized under negotiated contracts as shipments convert backlog to recognized revenue for accounting purposes, we may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog, and our backlog may not be indicative of future revenues. A portion of our backlog is concentrated in the international oil and gas market which may impact the overall timing of shipments or the conversion of backlog to revenue. The timing of the backlog is based on the requirement date indicated by our customers. Based on historical experience, management expects that a significant portion of our backlog may not be shipped within the next 18 months. The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and customer delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue. As a result, management believes the book-to-bill ratio better demonstrates the current demand for our products in the given period.\nIf we do not effectively implement our sales, marketing and service plans, our sales will not grow and our results of operations will suffer.\nOur sales and marketing efforts may not achieve intended results and, therefore, may not generate the revenue we anticipate. As a result of our corporate strategies, we have decided to focus our resources on expanding our Energy as a Service business and further developing selected vertical markets. We may change our focus to other markets or applications in the future. There can be no assurance that our focus or our near term plans will be successful. If we are not able to address markets for our products successfully, we may not be able to grow our business, compete effectively or achieve profitability.\nChanges to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, and sanctions caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase our costs or limit the amount of raw materials and products that we can import or may otherwise adversely impact our business.\nThe former U.S. administration has voiced strong concerns about imports from countries that it perceives as engaging in unfair trade practices. Any current or future U.S. administration may decide to impose import duties or other restrictions on products, components or raw materials sourced from those countries, which may include China, Mexico, and other countries from which we import components or raw materials. Any such duties or restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nMoreover, any new tariffs, or other changes in U.S. trade policy, could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries. Certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods. Others are considering the imposition of sanctions that will deny U.S. companies access to critical raw materials. A \u201ctrade war\u201d of this nature or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses.\nThe U.S. government imposes sanctions through executive orders restricting U.S. companies from conducting business activities with specified individuals and companies, and requires export licenses for certain of such activities. Following Russia\u2019s military invasion of Ukraine in March 2022, we re-evaluated our efforts in the Russian and the surrounding Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) markets and have ceased exploring growth opportunities in such markets. We do however continue to evaluate customer orders and ensure that we are in compliance with all laws and regulations upon acceptance and before shipment. If we are unable to conduct business with new or existing customers or pursue opportunities with sanctioned countries, including Russia, our business, including revenue, profitability, and cash flows, could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to retain or develop relationships with OEMs or distributors in our targeted markets, in which case our sales would not increase as expected.\nIn order to serve certain of our targeted markets, we believe that we must ally ourselves with companies that have particular expertise or better access to those markets. We believe that retaining or developing relationships with strong OEMs (which to date have typically resold our products under their own brands or packaged our products with other products as part of an integrated unit) or distributors in these targeted markets can improve the rate of adoption as well as reduce the direct financial burden of introducing a new technology and creating a new market. Because of OEMs\u2019 and distributors\u2019 relationships in their respective markets, the loss of an OEM or distributor could adversely impact the ability to penetrate our target markets. We offer our OEMs and distributors stated discounts from list price for the products they purchase. In the future, to attract and retain OEMs and distributors we may provide volume price discounts or otherwise incur significant costs that may reduce the potential revenue from these relationships. We may not be able to retain or develop appropriate OEMs and distributors on a timely basis, and we cannot provide assurance that the OEMs and distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products or will be successful in selling them. In addition, some of the relationships may require that we grant exclusive distribution rights in defined territories. These exclusive distribution arrangements could result in our being unable to enter into other arrangements at a time when the OEM or distributor with whom we form a relationship is not successful in selling our products or has reduced its commitment to market our products. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to negotiate collaborative relationships on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to have appropriate distribution in our target markets may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIf any of our distributor relationships is not successful, we may terminate or choose not to renew the related distributor agreement, which may result in interference with the wind down of the relationship or the transition of end-user service agreements, and could potentially negatively impact our distribution channel or result in litigation costs or other expenses.\nSuccessfully managing our distribution channel in an effort to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Each of our distributors is a strategically placed independent partner that provides for marketing and selling of our products and services on our behalf. If our distribution relationships are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers, and revenues. Our agreements with our distribution partners require them to comply with performance conditions that are subject to interpretation, which could result in disagreements. At any given time, we may be in disputes with one or more distribution partners. Any such dispute could result in lengthy and costly litigation, even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor. We cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation, the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with such distribution partners. A contractual dispute with a distribution partner may result in our or our distribution partner seeking to terminate the related distribution agreement, even if such termination would be wrongful, which could harm our business, or interfere with a previously agreed wind down of the relationship or transition of end-user service agreements. Any prolonged disruptions of our distribution channels that results from the termination of one or more of our distributions or our failure to renew our distribution agreements with our desired distributors, could negatively affect our ability to effectively sell our products and would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have substantial accounts receivable, and increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $24.7 million and $20.6 million as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (\u201cDSO\u201d) at the end of Fiscal 2022 was 150 days, compared with 111 days at the end of Fiscal 2021. We recorded net bad debt recovery of approximately $0.2 million during Fiscal 2021, and net bad debt expense of approximately $1.1 million during Fiscal 2022. No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels. Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.\nLoss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nE-Finity accounted for approximately 18% of our revenue for Fiscal 2022. Additionally, E-Finity accounted for 28% of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2022. The loss of E-Finity or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.\nWe believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products. Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to develop low cost design enhancements, to obtain necessary tooling and favorable supplier contracts and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions. Our failure to achieve such cost reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have realized reductions in our operating costs and, as a result, our ability to cut costs further and sustain our business initiatives may be limited.\nSince April 2015, we have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating costs across all functions of the Company and focus our business efforts on our most promising near-term product opportunities. As a result of these cost-cutting initiatives, which we have already undertaken over an extended period of time, we may have a more limited ability to further reduce costs to increase our liquidity should such measures become necessary. In March 2022, we implemented an expense reduction plan, which included furloughs, employment terminations and pay cuts. See \u201c-Our recently implemented expenses reduction plan and organizational changes undertaken to align to our focus on our EaaS business and achieving profitability may not be successful.\u201d Any further reductions may have a materially negative impact on our business.\nWe may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims.\nWe face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage. Although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. A significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed. If our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability.\nOperational restructuring may result in asset impairment or other unanticipated charges.\nAs a result of our corporate strategy, we have identified opportunities to outsource to third-party suppliers certain functions which we currently perform. We believe outsourcing can reduce product costs, improve product quality and increase operating efficiency. These actions may not yield the expected results, and outsourcing may result in production delays or lower quality products. Transitioning to outsourcing may cause certain of our affected employees to leave before the outsourcing is complete. This could result in a lack of the experienced in-house talent necessary to successfully implement the outsourcing. Further, depending on the nature of operations outsourced and the structure of agreements we reach with suppliers to perform these functions, we may experience impairment in the value of manufacturing assets related to the outsourced functions or other unanticipated charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth effectively, expand our production capabilities or improve our operational, financial and management information systems, which would impair our results of operations.\nIf we are successful in executing our business plan, we will experience growth in our business that could place a significant strain on our business operations, management and other resources. Our ability to manage our growth will require us to expand our production capabilities, continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, and to motivate and effectively manage our employees. We cannot provide assurance that our systems, procedures and controls or financial resources will be adequate, or that our management will keep pace with this growth. We cannot provide assurance that our management will be able to manage this growth effectively.\nOur success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of management and key employees.\nOur success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of our executive officers, senior management and sales and technical personnel. The failure of our personnel to execute our strategy or our failure to retain management and personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. In March 2022, we implemented an expense reduction plan, which included furloughs, employment terminations and pay cuts. See \u201c-Our recently implemented expenses reduction plan and organizational changes undertaken to align to our focus on our EaaS business and achieving profitability may not be successful.\u201d\nOur success, growth prospects, and ability to capitalize on market opportunities also depend to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire, motivate and retain qualified managerial personnel, including senior members of management. There can be no assurances that we can do so. Our growth may be constrained by resource limitations as competitors and customers compete for increasingly scarce human capital resources. The demand for skilled workers is currently high. We face an increasingly competitive labor market due to sustained labor shortages in part from the COVID-19 pandemic and are subject to inflationary pressures on employee wages and salaries which may increase labor costs. In addition, we have already experienced involuntary turnover due to increased commuting costs for our employees. If gas prices remain high for a sustained period, we may experience further involuntary turnover as employees seek to shorten their commutes. Our competitors may be able to offer a work environment with higher compensation or more opportunities than we can. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, our ability to successfully implement our business plan, grow our Company and maintain or expand our product offerings may be adversely affected, and the costs of doing so may increase, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our internal control systems rely on employees trained in the execution of the controls, particularly within our financial and accounting function. Loss of these employees or our inability to replace them with similarly skilled and trained individuals or new processes in a timely manner could adversely impact our internal control mechanisms.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, and other events beyond our control. Our executive offices, manufacturing facility, and auxiliary inventory storage facility are located in Southern California. Because the Southern California area is located in an earthquake-sensitive area and because we have no redundancy facility located within or outside of Southern California, we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to, or total destruction of, our facilities in Southern California and the surrounding transportation infrastructure, which could affect our ability to make and transport our products. While we take steps to mitigate the impact of severe weather, environmental and natural disasters, the frequency and severity of which may be impacted by climate change and other natural and manmade events, such events could result in severe disruption to our business operations at these facilities. If an earthquake, fire, or other man-made or natural disaster occurs at or near our facilities, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nActivities necessary to integrate any future acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.\nWe may acquire other businesses in the future and the success of these transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to develop productive relationships with the corresponding distributors and to integrate assets and personnel, if any, acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses. Future acquisitions may require us to raise financing including by issuing common stock that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company, record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses, and become subject to litigation. The benefits of an acquisition may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition will produce the intended benefits in a timely manner or to the extent anticipated or at all. We may experience difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company or be subjected to liability for the target\u2019s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest. Such integration may divert management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our business. Future acquisitions may also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions, the possibility of insufficient revenues to offset the expenses we incur in connection with an acquisition and potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees, customers, consumers and suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses. If we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the effects of climate change and may incur increased costs and experience other impacts due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas regulations designed to address climate change.\nThe scientific consensus indicates that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earth\u2019s atmosphere in ways that are affecting, and are expected to continue to affect, the global climate. The potential impacts of climate change on our customers, product offerings, operations, facilities and suppliers are accelerating and uncertain, as they will be particular to local and customer-specific circumstances. These potential impacts may include, among other items, physical long-term changes in freshwater availability and the frequency and severity of weather events as well as customer product changes either through preference or regulation.\nConcerns regarding climate change may lead to additional international, national, regional and local legislative and regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. Increased input costs, such as fuel, utility, transportation and compliance-related costs could increase our operating costs.\nWhile we aim to position ourselves as a solution for climate change related issues to our customers, there are other solutions in the market that may be cheaper or better suited to our customers\u2019 needs, and we may not be able to capitalize on the move towards renewable energy.\nAs the impact of any future GHG legislative or regulatory requirements on our global businesses and products is dependent on the timing, scope and design of the mandates or standards, we are currently unable to predict its potential impact which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nWe depend upon the development of new products and enhancements of existing products\nOur operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products, enhance existing products and reduce the costs to produce our products. The success of our products is dependent on several factors, including proper product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of the products, differentiation of products from those of our competitors, meeting changing customer requirements, emerging industry standards and market acceptance of these products. The development of new, technologically advanced products and enhancements is a complex and uncertain\nprocess requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely manner, successfully lower costs and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive. We continued to expand and develop our new hydrogen products during Fiscal 2022, which are commercially available running on a 30% hydrogen - 70% natural gas mix. Continued development towards a 100% hydrogen product will require a long time horizon and a significant amount of financial resources. We do not currently have and there can be no assurance that we will develop the resources or financial ability to develop a 100% hydrogen product.\nOur operating results are dependent, in large part, upon the successful commercialization of our products. Failure to produce our products as scheduled and budgeted would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe cannot be certain that we will deliver ordered products in a timely manner. We have limited production slots for our products. Any delays in production will increase our costs, reduce future production slots and could significantly impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to produce our products on a timely basis if we fail to correctly anticipate product supply requirements or if we suffer delays in production resulting from issues with our suppliers. Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of components or components of adequate quality, or they may provide components at significantly increased prices.\nSome of our components are currently available only from a single source or limited sources. We may experience delays in production if we fail to identify alternative suppliers, or if any parts supply is interrupted, each of which could materially adversely affect our business and operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause labor shortages and disrupt global supply chains, which has contributed to prolonged disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic is also contributing to growing inflationary pressures, particularly in the U.S., where inflation continues to show signs of acceleration. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with certain suppliers that allow them to procure inventories based upon criteria defined by us. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete inventories, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, if we fail to correctly anticipate our internal supply requirements, an undersupply of parts could limit our production capacity. Our inability to meet volume commitments with suppliers could affect the availability or pricing of our parts and components. A reduction or interruption in supply, a significant increase in price of one or more components or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business and operations and could materially damage our customer relationships. Financial problems of suppliers on whom we rely could limit our supply of components or increase our costs. Also, we cannot guarantee that any of the parts or components that we purchase will be of adequate quality or that the prices we pay for the parts or components will not increase. Inadequate quality of products from suppliers could interrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers in a timely manner. Additionally, defects in materials or products supplied by our suppliers that are not identified before our products are placed in service by our customers could result in higher warranty costs and damage to our reputation. We also outsource certain of our components internationally. As a result of outsourcing internationally, we may be subject to delays in delivery because of regulations associated with the import/export process, delays in transportation or regional instability.\nCommodity market factors impact our costs and availability of materials.\nOur products contain a number of commodity materials from metals, which include steel, special high temperature alloys, copper, nickel and molybdenum, to computer components. The availability of these commodities could impact our ability to acquire the materials necessary to meet our production requirements. The cost of metals has historically fluctuated. The pricing could impact the costs to manufacture our products. During Fiscal 2022, as a result of COVID-19 and other ongoing macroeconomic events, we saw significant price increases in the cost of our commodity materials. If we are not able to acquire commodity materials at prices and on terms satisfactory to us or at all, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market among competitors that have significantly greater resources than we have and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe compete with several technologies, including reciprocating engines, fuel cells and solar power. Competing technologies may receive certain benefits, like governmental subsidies or promotion, or be able to offer consumer rebates or other incentives that we cannot receive or offer to the same extent. This could enhance our competitors\u2019 abilities to fund research, penetrate markets or increase sales. We also compete with other manufacturers of microturbines.\nOur competitors include several well-known companies with histories of providing power solutions. They have substantially greater resources than we do and have established worldwide presence. Because of greater resources, some of our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can or lobby for governmental regulations and policies to create competitive advantages vis-\u00e0-vis our products. We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment by us in product development and quality, as well as attention to product performance, our product prices, our conformance to industry standards, manufacturing capability and sales and marketing. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including third parties with whom we have business relationships. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.\nOverall, the market for our products is highly competitive and is changing rapidly. We believe that the primary competitive factors affecting the market for our products, including some that are outside of our control, include:\n\u25cf name recognition, historical performance and market power of our competitors;\n\u25cf product quality and performance;\n\u25cf operating efficiency;\n\u25cf product price;\n\u25cf availability, price and compatibility of fuel;\n\u25cf development of new products and features; and\n\u25cf emissions levels.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against either current or potential competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.\nOur business and financial performance depends in part on the oil and natural gas industry, where a continued movement towards clean energy and away from fossil fuels, as well as a decline in prices for oil and natural gas may have an adverse effect on our revenue, cash flows, profitability and growth.\nRevenue in the oil and natural gas industry has been in decline for several years from our historical highs, due to volatility in oil prices, as well as a movement towards clean energy and away from fossil fuels, which has impacted capital expenditures in the oil and natural gas industry. We continue to be impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas industry. If prices were to decline and remain low for a sustained period, we would expect to see additional declines in our customers' spending which would have an adverse effect on our revenue. In addition, a worsening of these conditions may result in a material adverse impact on certain of our customers' liquidity and financial position resulting in further spending reductions, delays in the collection of amounts owing to us and other similar adverse effects. Despite a recent increase in oil prices, we have not yet seen a corresponding increase in sales activity, primarily due to the customers in our natural resources market vertical not yet increasing their spend on capital expenditures that would include our microturbine product.\nOur sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by risks inherent in international markets.\nAs we expand in international markets, customers may have difficulty or be unable to integrate our products into their existing systems or may have difficulty complying with foreign regulatory and commercial requirements. As a result, our products may require redesign. Any redesign of the product may delay sales or cause quality issues. In addition, we may be subject to a variety of other risks associated with international business, including import/export restrictions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic or political instability. Our business in particular is also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the implementation of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum to withdraw membership from the EU (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulation, including laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations.\nWe may not be able to develop sufficiently trained applications engineering, installation and service support to serve our targeted markets.\nOur ability to identify and develop business relationships with companies that can provide quality, cost-effective application engineering, installation and service can significantly affect our success. The application engineering and proper installation of our microturbines, as well as proper maintenance and service, are critical to the performance of the units. Additionally, we need to reduce the total installed cost of our microturbines to enhance market opportunities. Our inability to improve the quality of applications, installation and service while reducing associated costs could affect the marketability of our products.\nChanges in our product components may require us to replace parts held at distributors.\nWe have entered into agreements with some of our distributors requiring that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors. As a result, it is possible that future changes in our product technology could involve costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position.\nUtility companies or governmental entities could place barriers to our entry into the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.\nUtility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our products or the interconnection of the products with the electric grid. Further, they may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site generation or have the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes. These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems. This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and other operating results. In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. The cost of electric power generation bears a close relationship to natural gas and other fuels. However, changes to electric utility tariffs often require lengthy regulatory approval and include a mix of fuel types as well as customer categories. Potential customers may perceive the resulting swings in natural gas and electric pricing as an increased risk of investing in on-site generation.\nRisks Related to Pending Litigation and Government Regulation\nWe operate in a highly regulated business environment, and changes in regulation could impose significant costs on us or make our products less economical, thereby affecting demand for our microturbines.\nOur products are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, governing, among other things, emissions and occupational health and safety. Regulatory agencies may impose special requirements for the implementation and operation of our products or that may significantly affect or even eliminate some of our target markets. We may incur material costs or liabilities in complying with government regulations. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations,\nrequirements and approvals that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain any such approvals in a timely manner, or at all. Non-compliance with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, our potential utility customers must comply with numerous laws and regulations. The deregulation of the utility industry may also create challenges for our marketing efforts. For example, as part of electric utility deregulation, federal, state and local governmental authorities may impose transitional charges or exit fees, which would make it less economical for some potential customers to switch to our products.\nThe market for electricity and generation products is heavily influenced by federal and state government regulations and policies. The deregulation and restructuring of the electric industry in the United States and elsewhere may cause rule changes that may reduce or eliminate some of the advantages of such deregulation and restructuring. We cannot determine how any deregulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry may ultimately affect the market for our microturbines. Changes in regulatory standards or policies could reduce the level of investment in the research and development of alternative power sources, including microturbines. Any reduction or termination of such programs could increase the cost to our potential customers, making our systems less desirable, and thereby adversely affect our revenue and other operating results.\nWe have significant tax assets, usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future.\nAt March 31, 2022, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $566.5 million and $177.1 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. Any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including through sales of stock by large stockholders, which are outside of our control, could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities.\nWe may be subject to lawsuits.\nWe may be named as defendants in future lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and, to the extent available, liability insurance. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any significant judgment or settlement amount may require us to incur additional indebtedness, adversely affect our liquidity and ability to service our indebtedness, or require us to restructure or amend the terms of our indebtedness. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K for more information regarding currently pending legal proceedings.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may face litigation relating to intellectual property, labor, product liability, stockholder and other matters. An adverse judgment could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all. Whether or not resolved in a manner adverse to us, any litigation could be costly, divert management attention or result in increased costs of doing business. Further, our insurance coverage is limited for these and other claims against us, and we may not have adequate insurance or financial resources to pay for our liabilities or losses from any such claims.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\nOur business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.\nWe view our intellectual property rights as important assets. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements. These protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any confidentiality agreements with us, copying or reverse engineering our products, or\ndeveloping and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business. If it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail. We cannot guarantee that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. Moreover, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products. In addition, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any such claim, even if it is without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to defend, subject us to damages, cause us to cease making, using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, require us to redesign our products, divert management time and attention and/or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements.\nWe face security and cybersecurity risks related to our electronic processing of sensitive and confidential business and product data. If we are unable to protect our data or the data of our customers, a security breach could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a manufacturer of high technology commercial products, we face security and cyber security threats, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures or cyber security attacks. Given the nature of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer and associated data, in addition to proprietary business information. Our business, including our turbines and related energy assets may be vulnerable to a data compromise, computer viruses, physical and electronic break-ins and manipulations and similar disruptions, which may not be prevented by our efforts to secure our computer systems and assets, which include vulnerability scans and patching, network firewalls, identity and access management, data encryption, intrusion detection and prevention devices. Our cybersecurity efforts may not be able to prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks and a successful breach of our computer systems could result in misappropriation of personal, payment or sensitive business information. In addition, we rely on associates, contractors and other third parties that may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. A security breach involving confidential and proprietary data or the fleet of turbines we have deployed across the globe for our customers could damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers or gain new customers and impact the competitive advantages derived from our R&D efforts, the usefulness of our products and services, and ultimately our stock price. In addition, we may incur material liabilities and remediation costs as a result of a security breach, and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business. Moreover, evolving privacy laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the adoption by the European Union of the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective May 2018, establishes new individual privacy rights and imposes increased obligations on companies handling personal data. Consequently, we may incur significant costs related to prevention and compliance with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information. Further, a greater number of our employees are working remotely, which could expose us to greater risks related to cybersecurity and our information technologies systems.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe cannot be certain of the future effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over our financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in our ability to provide reliable, and timely financial reports and the value of our common stock may decline.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal controls over financial reporting. Our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of March 31, 2022. We may in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to\nhappen, our investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our common stock could decline and we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC.\nFuture issuances or sales of our common stock or exercises by holders of our outstanding warrants could lower our stock price and dilute the interests of existing stockholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by investors that acquired such common stock, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Pursuant to the A&R NPA Second Amendment, we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to raise at least $10 million through a sale of our common stock by September 14, 2022. We may also sell up to $50 million of shares of our common stock in \u201cat-the-market\u2019 offerings pursuant to the sales agreement entered into with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC on June 7, 2018 and as amended on July 15, 2020 and March 29, 2021. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, pursuant to the capital raise contemplated by the A&R NPA Second Amendment, the at-the-market offering sales agreement or otherwise, or anticipation of any such sales, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise desire. In addition, issuances of any shares of our common stock sold pursuant to the sales agreement will have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future public sales of our common stock or the availability of additional shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market and trading price of our common stock. In addition, we currently have warrants outstanding for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 0.8 million shares of our common stock and certain of our warrant holders also have the right to require us to register under the Securities Act the shares issuable upon exercise of their warrants. In addition, some of our outstanding warrants contain anti-dilution provisions that may, under certain circumstances, increase the number of shares issuable thereunder. To the extent the warrants outstanding are fully exercised, a significant number of shares of common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of our shares of common stock and an increase in the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. If any of our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market and trading price of our securities, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.\nAn investment in our securities is risky, and stockholders could lose their investment in our securities or suffer significant losses and wide fluctuations in the market value of their investment. The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. Given the continued uncertainty surrounding many variables that may affect our business and the industry in which we operate, our ability to foresee results for future periods is limited. This variability could affect our operating results and thereby adversely affect our stock price. Many factors that contribute to this volatility are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to change, regardless of our operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price may include, among other things:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf market sentiment toward alternative energy stocks in general or toward us;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in our industry or the overall economy;\n\u25cf loss of one or more of our significant customers;\n\u25cf errors, omissions or failures by third parties in meeting commitments to us;\n\u25cf changes in the market valuations or earnings of our competitors or other technology companies;\n\u25cf the trading of options on our common stock;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives;\n\u25cf announcements of significant market events, such as power outages, regulatory changes or technology changes;\n\u25cf changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our market;\n\u25cf future equity financings;\n\u25cf the failure to produce our products on a timely basis in accordance with customer expectations;\n\u25cf the inability to obtain necessary components on time and at a reasonable cost;\n\u25cf litigation or disputes with customers or business partners;\n\u25cf capital commitments;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales or purchases of our common stock;\n\u25cf the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations; and\n\u25cf further decreases in or continued low levels of oil, natural gas and electricity prices.\nMarket conditions may result in volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock. For example, between April 1, 2019 and March 31, 2022, the market price of our common stock ranged from $8.90 to $4.12. Global financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months, including, among other things, extreme volatility in securities prices. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in financial markets and adverse economic conditions throughout the world.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against the company. This type of litigation, regardless of whether we prevail on the underlying claim, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable independent research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts that covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our NOL rights plan, as well as Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nProvisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, could discourage, delay or prevent unsolicited proposals to merge with or acquire us, even though such proposals may be at a premium price or otherwise beneficial to you. These provisions include our Board\u2019s authorization to issue shares of preferred stock, on terms the Board determines in its discretion, without stockholder approval, and the following provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such stockholder acquired such status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.\nOn May 6, 2019, we and Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. successor-in-interest to Computershare Inc., as Rights Agent, entered into the NOL Rights Agreement, which is designed to diminish the risk that our ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax assets to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations would become subject to limitations by reason of us experiencing an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The NOL Rights Agreement replaces the Company\u2019s Rights Agreement, dated May 6, 2016, by and between the Company and Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., as successor-in-interest to Computershare Inc., as rights agent (the \u201cOriginal Rights Agreement\u201d). On April 7, 2022, our Board approved an extension of the NOL Rights Agreement from May 6, 2022 to May 6, 2025, subject to obtaining shareholder approval ratifying such extension. While this NOL Rights Agreement is intended to preserve our net operating losses, it effectively deters current and future purchasers from becoming 4.99% stockholders. The NOL Rights Agreement could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends. We have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our securities will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nWe have not paid dividends on any of our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our securities if the price of our common stock increases.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAdverse economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition, including some effects we may not be able to predict.\nAdverse economic conditions, such as recent supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and persistent inflation, may prevent our customers from purchasing our products or delay their purchases, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources. Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by adverse economic conditions. Our revenue continues to be negatively impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing global geopolitical tensions. Adverse economic developments affect businesses such as ours and those of third parties on which we rely in a number of ways that could result in unfavorable consequences to us. Current economic conditions or a deepening economic downturn in the United States and elsewhere may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively impact our short-term and long-term liquidity.\nOur business may be impacted by international instability, war, terrorism, and geopolitical events.\nInternational political and economic instability or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect the performance of our services, sale of our products or other business operations. See \u201c-Changes to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, and sanctions caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase our costs or limit the amount of raw materials and products that we can import or may otherwise adversely impact our business\u201d for a discussion of the impact of Russia\u2019s military invasion of Ukraine on our business and results of operations. A slowdown in economic growth in some emerging markets could result in long sales cycles, greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles. Fluctuations or devaluations in currency values, especially in emerging markets, could have an adverse effect on us, our suppliers, logistics providers and manufacturing vendors. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 88332, "SIC": 3510, "TIC": "CPST"}
