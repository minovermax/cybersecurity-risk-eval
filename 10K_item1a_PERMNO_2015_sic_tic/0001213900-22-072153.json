{"cik": "1667313", "company": "Zedge, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-11-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks associated with any one of our businesses, as well as the other risks highlighted elsewhere in this document, particularly the discussions about competition. The trading price of our Class B common stock could decline due to any of these risks.\nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could cause our business, financial condition or operating results to be harmed, including, but not limited to, risks regarding the following:\n\u25cf We offer a suite of freemium apps and we may not be successful in adding new users or in retaining existing users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products or do not make optional purchases of tokens, resources, or content, or convert into paying subscribers and renew their paid subscriptions our revenue, financial results and business may be significantly harmed.\n\u25cf We may not be successful in acquiring a sufficient number of users that become purchasers or retain existing users who generate profitable revenue for our apps.\n\u25cf We may not manage our in-app economy well and as a result, disincentivize users from making in-app purchases. Any failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u25cf If we fail to attract advertisers or if advertisers reduce their spend with us, our revenues, profitability and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\n\u25cf The digital advertising market may deteriorate or develop more slowly than expected, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.\n\u25cf A material amount of our revenue is generated from a limited number of geographies and third-party advertising demand partners. Any change to this mix could result in negatively impacting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u25cf Our apps\u2019 user base is heavily weighted to the Android operating system and our revenues and profitability may suffer if the market demand for Android smartphones decreases.\n\u25cf We rely on third-party platforms, such as the iOS App Store, Facebook, and Google Play Store, to distribute our apps and collect revenues generated on these platforms. If these platforms adopt policies including those relating to advertising, privacy, or monetization that are counter to our strategy it could result in materially and adversely affecting our business.\n\u25cf Zedge Premium, the section of our marketplace where we offer premium content (i.e. for purchase), may not yield the strategic goals and objectives that we envision, and our revenues, profitability and prospects may be materially and adversely negatively affected.\n\u25cf If we fail to maintain and enhance our various brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\n\u25cf We may not be able to effectively manage our growth or implement our future business strategies, in which case our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\n\u25cf If we fail to keep up with rapid technological changes in the internet and smartphone industries and adapt our products and services accordingly, our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected.\n\u25cf We have offices and other significant operations located in Lithuania, Israel, and Norway, and, therefore, our results may be adversely affected by political, economic and military instability in these countries.\n\u25cf Zedge may be unable to successfully integrate GuruShots into Zedge\n\u25cf Data privacy and security laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business subject us to possible sanctions, civil lawsuits (including class action or similar representative lawsuits) and other penalties in the event of non-compliance, additionally the need to observe these regulations increases the cost of doing business and these laws and regulations are continually evolving. Compliance failure either by us or our partners, or vendors could harm our business.\n\u25cf Our business depends on our ability to collect and effectively use data to serve relevant advertising, deliver suitable content, and identify appropriate customer prospects, and any limitation on the collection and use of this data could significantly diminish the value of our services, cause us to lose clients, make us less attractive to prospective customers and revenues.\n\u25cf Security breaches or computer virus attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and results of operations.\n\u25cf We are controlled by our majority stockholder, which limits the ability of other stockholders to affect our management.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nCertain of our offerings, including GuruShots\u2019 participation in gallery exhibitions, are sensitive to consumer spending and economic conditions.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary retail items and specialty retail products, as well as participation in gallery events, may be adversely affected by national and regional economic, market and other conditions such as employment levels, salary and wage levels, the availability of consumer credit, inflation, high interest rates, high tax rates, high fuel prices, the threat of a pandemic or other health crisis (such as COVID-19) and consumer confidence with respect to current and future economic, market and other conditions. Consumer purchases may decline during recessionary periods or at other times when unemployment is higher or disposable income is lower. Consumer willingness to make discretionary purchases may decline, may stall or may be slow to increase due to national and regional economic conditions. GuruShots derives revenues form arranging for certain of its users to display their photographs in art galleries. There remains considerable uncertainty and volatility in the national and global economy. Further or future slowdowns or disruptions in the economy, market and other conditions could adversely affect us and our business strategy. We may not be able to sustain or increase our current net sales if there is a decline in consumer spending.\nThe market prices of many digital assets, including NFTs, have experienced significant declines in recent periods and may continue to do so. Further declines in the market prices of digital assets, could have a material adverse effect on our NFTs Made Easy offering, our financial performance, and results of our operations.\nThe market prices of many digital assets, including NFTs, experienced significant declines in the fourth quarter of 2021 and to date in 2022. Despite the increased popularity of NFTs in 2021, sales volumes of NFTs declined consistently throughout 2022, dropping by as much as 60% in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the previous quarter, according to some market analysts. Further declines in the market prices of digital assets, could have a material adverse effect on our NFTs Made Easy offerings, our financial performance, and results of our operations.\nThe value of NFTs is uncertain and may subject us to unforeseeable risks.\nWe allow our creators to offer NFTs for sale. NFTs are unique, one-of-a-kind, or limited series, digital assets made possible by certain digital asset network protocols. Because of their non-fungible nature, NFTs introduce digital scarcity and have become popular as online \u201ccollectibles,\u201d similar to physical rare collectible items, such as trading cards or art. Like real world collectibles, the value of NFTs may be prone to \u201cboom and bust\u201d cycles as popularity increases and subsequently subsides. If any of these bust cycles were to occur, it could adversely affect the value of certain of our future strategies.\nThe prices of digital assets are extremely volatile, and such volatility may have a material adverse effect on our NFTs Made Easy offering.\nThe market prices of many digital assets, including NFTs, have experienced extreme volatility in recent periods and may continue to do so. For instance, there were steep increases in the value of certain digital assets over the course of 2017, and multiple market observers asserted that digital assets were experiencing a \u201cbubble.\u201d These increases were followed by steep drawdowns throughout 2018 in digital asset trading prices. These drawdowns notwithstanding, digital asset prices, increased significantly again during 2019, decreased significantly again in the first quarter of 2020 amidst broader market declines as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak and increased significantly again over the remainder of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. Digital asset prices continued to experience significant and sudden changes throughout 2021 followed by steep drawdowns in the fourth quarter of 2021 and to date in 2022.\nDecreases in the price of even a single other digital asset may cause volatility in the entire digital asset industry and may affect the value of other digital assets, including our NFTs Made Easy offering. For example, a security breach or any other incident or set of circumstances that affects purchaser or user confidence in a well-known digital asset may affect the industry as a whole and may also cause the price of other digital assets, including NFTs, to fluctuate.\nExtreme volatility may persist and the value of NFTs may significantly decline in the future without recovery. Moreover, digital asset platforms are relatively new and the digital asset markets may still be experiencing a bubble or may experience a bubble again in the future. For example, in the first half of 2022, each of Celsius Network, Voyager Digital Ltd., and Three Arrows Capital declared bankruptcy, resulting in a loss of confidence in participants of the digital asset ecosystem and negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly.\nExtreme volatility in the future could have a material adverse effect on the value of NFTs Made Easy offering. Furthermore, negative perception, a lack of stability and standardized regulation in the digital asset economy may reduce confidence in the digital asset economy and may result in greater volatility in the price of NFTs and other digital assets, including a depreciation in value.\nWe offer a suite of freemium apps and we may not be successful in adding new users or in retaining existing users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products or do not make optional purchases of tokens, resources, or content, or convert into paying subscribers and renew their paid subscriptions our revenue, financial results and business may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our user base and our users\u2019 level of engagement and paid conversion are fundamental to our success. Our financial performance has been and will continue to be dependent by our ability to successfully add new users, retain and engage existing users and convert them into paying users and/or subscribers. Over the past several years, we have experienced periods of growth and contraction, as well as a shift of users from well developed markets to emerging markets and we expect that the size of our user base will fluctuate over time. If consumers and/or creators do not perceive our products as useful, effective, entertaining, reliable, and/or trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or keep users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement or the percentage of users that are converted into paying subscribers. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a decline in our user base or engagement levels. User engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new and different products and services and as various privacy regulations evolve. Any number of factors can negatively affect user growth, engagement and conversion, including:\n\u25cf users opt to utilize other competitive products or services instead of our own;\n\u25cf user behavior changes with respect to our products and services resulting in a decrease of engagement and/or session time;\n\u25cf users decrease their engagement, session time, or uninstall our apps because of product decisions that we make with respect to introducing new features, feature enhancements, an/or monetization techniques;\n\u25cf users lose confidence in how we utilize user data and/or or privacy policy;\n\u25cf users cease making in-app purchases or in paying for subscriptions;\n\u25cf users have difficulty accessing our products and services as a result of our actions or those of third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\n\u25cf we fail to introduce new features, products or services that users want or enhance the existing products and services with improvements that users are interested in;\n\u25cf we are unable to acquire users through cost-effective marketing efforts, including both organic and paid channels;\n\u25cf initiatives designed to attract and maintain users and increase engagement are unsuccessful because of errors that we make or policies instituted by third parties that we use to distribute our products or deliver our services;\n\u25cf adopting terms, policies or procedures related to areas such as privacy, user data, content ownership, or monetization techniques that are received negatively by our users or creators;\n\u25cf inability to offer relevant content to our users;\n\u25cf poor support for our users and creators;\n\u25cf outages or other technical problems that result in making our products and services inaccessible, unreliable or that result in a poor user experience;\n\u25cf actions by governments that affect accessibility to our products and services in any market; or\n\u25cf regulations and/or litigation that result in users not accepting our terms of use because of measures that we have taken in order to ensure compliance.\nCertain of these factors have, at various times, negatively impacted user and creator growth, MAU and engagement. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, our revenue and financial results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not experience growth or engagement in certain geographic locations due to local factors.\nWe may not experience rapid user growth or continued engagement in countries that have unreliable telecommunications infrastructure or in countries where mobile and internet usage are expensive. Any decrease in user growth or engagement may have a material and adverse impact on our popularity, revenue, business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in acquiring a sufficient number of users that become purchasers or retain existing users who generate profitable revenue for our apps.\nRevenues of freemium apps and websites typically rely on a small percentage of users that convert into paying users by making in-app purchases of digital goods and/or paid subscriptions; however, the vast majority of users play for free or only occasionally make purchases or opt-in for paid subscription. Accordingly, only a small percentage of our users are paying users. In addition, a small portion of paying users generate a disproportionate percentage of revenue. Because of this, it is imperative for us to both retain these valuable customers and to maintain or increase their spend over time. In fiscal 2022, we experienced a 3.7% decline in in-app purchases and paid subscriptions. Conversely, over the past six years, GuruShots has successfully increased the compounded annual growth rate of monthly spending per paying player by around 14%. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to retain paying users or that paying users will maintain or increase their spending. We may experience a net decline in paying players resulting in a decrease in revenue resulting in a materially adverse outcome for our business and financial results.\nWe may not manage our in-app economy well and as a result, disincentivize users from making in-app purchases. Any failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur apps are available to players for free and each brand generates a material portion of its revenue by selling digital goods and/or paid subscriptions. The perceived value of these digital goods and/or paid subscriptions can be impacted by various factors including their price, discounting policies, etc. If we fail to manage our economy well we risk confusing or upsetting users to the point that they reduce their purchases which could negatively hurt the business.\nIf we fail to attract advertisers or if advertisers reduce their spend with us, our revenues, profitability and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn fiscal 2022, approximately 76% of our revenues (excluding GuruShots) were generated from selling advertising inventory. We anticipate that our growth and profitability will continue to depend on our ability to sell our advertising inventory. Companies that advertise with us may choose to utilize other advertising channels or may reduce or eliminate their marketing altogether for a variety of reasons, many of which are out of our control, including, without limitation, if the demand for mobile phone personalization industry declines or otherwise falls out of favor with advertisers or consumers.\nIf the size of the digital advertising market does not increase from current levels, or if our digital brands are unable to capture and retain a sufficient share of that market, our ability to maintain or increase our current level of advertising revenues and our revenues, profitability and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe digital advertising market may deteriorate or develop more slowly than expected, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe generate the substantial majority of our revenue from selling advertising inventory. We anticipate that our growth and profitability will continue to depend on our ability to sell advertising inventory across some if not all of our digital brands.\nMobile connected devices, especially smartphones, are a relatively new advertising medium. Advertisers have historically spent a smaller portion of their advertising budgets on mobile media as compared to traditional advertising methods, such as television, newspapers, radio and billboards, or online advertising over the internet, such as placing banner ads on websites.\nFuture demand and market acceptance for mobile advertising is uncertain. Many advertisers still have limited experience with mobile advertising and may continue to devote larger portions of their advertising budgets to more traditional offline or online personal computer-based advertising, instead of shifting additional advertising resources to mobile advertising.\nFurther, our advertisers\u2019 ability to effectively target their advertising to our user\u2019s interests may be negatively impacted by the degree to which our privacy control measures that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with regulations, regulatory actions, the user experience, or otherwise, and our advertising revenue may decrease or otherwise be curtailed as a result. Changes to operating systems\u2019 practices and policies, such as Apple\u2019s deprecating the Identifier for Advertisers (\u201cIDFA\u201d) and Google\u2019s expected deprecation of \u201ctracking cookies\u201d may also reduce the quantity and quality of the data and metrics that can be collected or used by us and our partners. These limitations may adversely affect our advertisers\u2019 ability to effectively target advertisements and measure their performance, which could reduce the demand and pricing for our advertising products and harm our business. As such, our digital property\u2019s current and potential advertiser clients may ultimately find digital advertising to be less effective than traditional advertising media or marketing methods or other technologies for promoting their products and services, and they may even reduce their spending on mobile advertising from current levels as a result or for other reasons.\nIf the market for mobile advertising deteriorates, or develops more slowly than we expect, we may not be able to increase our revenues or our revenues and profitability could decline materially.\nA material amount of our revenue is generated from a limited number of geographies and third-party advertising demand partners. Any change to this mix could result in negatively impacting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn fiscal 2022, revenue from well developed economies accounted for approximately 73% of our total revenues and 83% of our total revenues were generated by four advertising demand partners. While our end users are located around the world, the revenue is generated in the United States from our advertising partners. During the past five years, we have experienced a shift in our Zedge App\u2019s regional customer make-up with the percentage of our total MAU from emerging markets increasing, while the portion from well-developed markets is decreasing. In fiscal 2022, 77% our Zedge App\u2019s users were located in emerging markets with 23% of users in well-developed regions compared to 75% and 24% respectively in fiscal 2021. India comprised 28% of our MAU as of July 31, 2022. This shift has negatively impacted revenues because well-developed markets command materially higher advertising rates when compared to those in emerging markets. Although we are investing in reversing this trend, we may not be successful in this effort which may result in lower revenues and profitability. Although, GuruShots\u2019 and Emojipedia\u2019s user bases are more heavily weighted to well-developed economies, we are still exposed to the impact of a shift in our Zedge App\u2019s user base toward emerging markets.\nThree advertising demand partners, mainly, Google, Facebook and Applovin were responsible for 63% of overall revenue in fiscal 2022. If any of these advertising demand partners were to alter their spend on our digital properties the outcome could result in lowering revenues and profitability.\nOur apps\u2019 user base is heavily weighted to the Android operating system and our revenues and profitability may suffer if the market demand for Android smartphones decreases.\nOur apps\u2019 user base is heavily weighted to smartphones running the Android operating system, which constituted approximately 96% of our MAU (excluding Emojipedia) as of July 31, 2022, and most of our revenues for fiscal 2022. Any significant downturn in the overall demand for Android smartphones or the use of Android smartphones could significantly and adversely affect the demand for our products and services and would materially affect our revenues.\nAlthough the Android smartphone market has grown rapidly in recent years, it is uncertain whether the Android smartphone market will continue growing at a similar rate in the future. In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of the smartphone industry, another operating system for smartphones may eclipse the Android operating system and result in a decline in its popularity, which would likely adversely affect our apps\u2019 popularity. To the extent that our products and services continue operating on Android smartphones and to the extent that our future revenues substantially depend on the use and sales of Android smartphones, our business and financial results would be vulnerable to any downturns in the Android smartphone market.\nWe may not be successful in diversifying our revenue mix in order to reduce our significant dependence on third-party advertisers.\nIn fiscal 2022, approximately 80% of our revenues excluding GuruShots were generated from advertising sales. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in diversifying our revenue mix by identifying new revenue drivers that complement our advertising-heavy business. Although the Zedge App had initial success in converting freemium users into paid subscribers, starting with zero in January 2019 and ending fiscal 2021 with approximately 752,000, we ended fiscal 2022 with 692,000 subscribers, an 8% decline and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in improving subscriber base growth or in maintaining our current subscriber base. To date, Zedge Premium has taken longer to scale than we originally anticipated, and our \u2018NFTs Made Easy\u2019 offering is still in the early stages of development. Furthermore, we are still integrating GuruShots and have not achieved its expected growth trajectory or realized synergies between GuruShots and our legacy operations. Finally, Android users constitute approximately 96% of our overall MAU and are prone to spend less money in apps than iOS and web users. Even if our new initiatives are successful on one platform we may not be able to replicate that success across other platforms.\nOur revenues may fluctuate materially due to increases and decreases of new mobile device sales, or other factors, over which we have no control.\nOur revenue may be materially negatively impacted by a decrease or slowdown in new mobile device sales. Demand for mobile devices highly correlates to installs of our apps and associated usage and revenue generation.\nInitially the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted new user growth. New smartphone sales suffered as a result of retail business closures, negatively impacting new user growth, especially in well-developed markets. Any e-retail business rebound will be subject to many factors including the state of the global and local economies.\nIf new mobile device sales decrease or slowdown, our products and services will likely experience fewer installations which will negatively impact our revenue and operations.\nWe rely on third-party platforms, such as the iOS App Store, Facebook, and Google Play Store, to distribute our apps and collect revenues generated on these platforms. If these platforms adopt policies including those relating to advertising, privacy, or monetization that are counter to our strategy it could result in materially and adversely affecting our business.\nOur products and services depend on mobile app stores and other third parties such as data center service providers, as well as third party payment aggregators, computer systems, internet transit providers and other communications systems and service providers. Our mobile applications are almost exclusively accessed through and depend on the Google Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store. While our mobile applications are generally free to download, we offer our users the opportunity to make in-app purchases and/or purchase paid subscriptions. In certain instances, we determine the prices at which these items and subscriptions are sold. These purchases are processed by Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s in-app payment and subscription systems. As of July 31, 2022 we paid Google and Apple, approximately 16% of the revenue we generated across their respective platforms. Our cashflow may be negatively impacted if either platform changes that timing of their payments to us. While we do not anticipate any interruption in their distribution platforms or ability to accept customer payments, any such disruptions, even temporary, may have material impacts on our business and operations.\nWe are subject to the standard policies and terms of service of third-party platforms, which govern the marketing, promotion, distribution, content and operation of our apps on their platforms. Each platform provider has the discretion to make changes to its operating system, payment services, manner in which their mobile operating system operates as well as change and interpret the terms and conditions of its developer policies. These changes may be harmful to our business and result in a negative outcome. For example, in September 2019, our Zedge App was temporarily removed from Google Play because they asserted that the Zedge App violated their malicious behavior policy. As a result, prospective Android users were prevented from installing our Zedge App, freemium users were unable to convert into paying subscribers and existing users we unable to purchase Zedge Credits. Shortly after the notice was issued, two of our major advertising suppliers ceased serving advertisements to our Zedge App. In addition, Google Play sent a notification to users that had the problematic version of the app on their phone recommending that they uninstall it. We identified the source of the problem as buggy code from a long-term, third-party advertising partner\u2019s standard technology integration in our app. We corrected the problem by removing the offensive code, releasing a new version of our app and our Zedge App was reinstated after approximately 72 hours and concurrently the two major advertising suppliers resumed purchasing our advertising inventory. We estimate the immediate financial impact of the suspension resulted in approximately $100,000 in lost revenue and a material decline in MAU with the majority of uninstalls in emerging markets.\nSuch changes could:\n\u25cf make our products and services inaccessible or limit their accessibility;\n\u25cf curtail our ability to distribute and update our applications as we see fit across their platforms;\n\u25cf impose changes in the way in which we monetize our users;\n\u25cf limit the scope of feature enhancements or new features;\n\u25cf decrease or eliminate our ability to market to prospective and existing users; or\n\u25cf cease our ability to collect certain data about users and their respective usage.\nGoogle and Apple are able to terminate our distribution agreements with them, without cause, with 30 days prior written notice (to the extent allowed by applicable local law). They also may terminate our agreements with them immediately (unless a longer period is required by applicable law) under certain circumstances, including upon our uncured breach of such agreements. To the extent that they or any other third party platform provider on which we rely make such changes or terminates our agreements with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA platform provider may also change its fee structure to our disadvantage, change how we are able to advertise on the platform, limit how user information is made available to developers, curtail how personal information is used for advertising purposes, or restrict how users can share information with their friends on the platform or across platforms. For example, in April 2021 Apple released iOS 14 which started requiring users to opt in to share their IDFA with app developers, on an app-by-app basis. As a consequence, the ability of advertisers to accurately target and measure their advertising campaigns at the user level become significantly more difficult typically resulting in higher user acquisition costs.\nIf we violate, or a platform provider believes we have violated, its terms of service, the platform provider reserves the right to limit or cease access to their platform. If we are unable to maintain a productive working relationship with any platform distribution and access to our products and services could also be curtailed or permanently disabled. This is especially true in instances where we are dependent on single source providers for their respective services. Any limitation or discontinuation of access to any platform could significantly reduce our ability to distribute and/or provide access to our products to users and would like result in materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on the availability of mobile app stores and other third party platforms and any outages that these parties experience will likely have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nIf technologies designed to block the display of advertisements are adopted en masse, or if web browsers limit or block behavioral targeting technologies our revenues may be adversely affected.\nOur digital products and services may suffer negative consequences, including a material reduction of revenue, with mass adoption of website ad blocking technologies or other technologies that limit the ability to personalize advertisements, including, without limitation, if the price for this advertising inventory declines.\nActivities of our advertiser clients and/or users could damage our reputation or give rise to legal claims against us.\nOur advertisers and/or users may not comply with international or domestic laws, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to mobile communications. Failure of our advertisers and/or users to comply with laws or our policies could damage our reputation and expose us to liability under these laws. We may also be liable to third parties for content in the advertisements or content we deliver or distribute if the artwork, text or other content involved violates copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties or if the content is defamatory, unfair and deceptive, or otherwise in violation of applicable laws. Although we generally receive assurance from our advertising partners and users that their advertisements and content, respectively, are lawful and that they have the right to use any copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property included in an advertisement or content, and although we are normally indemnified by the advertisers, a third party or regulatory authority may still file a claim against us. Any such claims could be costly and time consuming to defend and could also hurt our reputation within the mobile advertising industry. Further, if we are exposed to legal liability, we could be required to pay substantial fines or penalties, redesign our business methods, discontinue some of our services or otherwise expend significant resources.\nWe may not be able to continually meet our users\u2019 expectations and retain or expand our user base, and our revenues, profitability and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough we constantly monitor and research our users\u2019 expectations, we may be unable to meet them on an ongoing basis or anticipate future user needs. A decrease in the number of users engaging with our products and services may have a material and adverse effect on our ability to sell advertising, digital goods and resources, and subscriptions and on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In order to attract and retain users and remain competitive, we must continue to innovate our products and services, improve user experience, and implement new technologies and functionalities.\nThe internet business is characterized by constant changes, including but not limited to rapid technological evolution, continual shifts in user expectations, frequent introductions of new products and services and constant emergence of new industry standards and practices. As a result, our users may leave us for our competitors\u2019 products and services more quickly than in other sectors. Thus, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond to these changes in a timely and cost-effective basis, including improving and marketing our existing products and services and developing and pricing new products and services in response to evolving user needs. Our ability to successfully retain or expand our user base will depend on our ability to achieve the following, among others:\n\u25cf anticipate and effectively respond to the growing number of internet users in general and our users in particular;\n\u25cf attract, retain and motivate talent, including but not limited to application developers, visual designers, product and program managers and engineers who have experience developing consumer facing digital products or other mobile internet products and services;\n\u25cf effectively market our existing and new products and services in response to evolving user needs;\n\u25cf develop in a timely fashion and launch new products and features, and develop and launch other internet products cost-effectively;\n\u25cf funnel our existing users and prospects into new products that we develop, independent of our current product suite, and convert them into recurring users of these new products;\n\u25cf successfully recruit new users, artists, individual creators and brands that offer their content to our users;\n\u25cf further improve our platform to provide a compelling and optimal user experience through integration of products and services provided by existing and new third-party developers or business partners; and\n\u25cf continue to provide quality content to attract and retain our users and advertisers.\nWe cannot assure you that our existing products and services, will remain sufficiently popular with our users. We may be unsuccessful in adding compelling new features and enhancements; products and services to further diversify these product offerings. Unexpected technical, commercial or operational problems could delay or prevent the introduction of one or more of our new products or services to our users. Moreover, we cannot be sure that any of our new products and services, will achieve widespread market acceptance or generate incremental revenue the way our existing products and services have. If we fail in earning user satisfaction through our products or services or if our products and services fail to meet our expectation to maintain and expand our user base, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nZedge Premium, the section of our marketplace where we offer premium content (i.e. for purchase), may not yield the strategic goals and objectives that we envision, and our revenues, profitability and prospects may be materially and adversely negatively affected.\nAlthough we believe that Zedge Premium will act as an important driver in helping our platform become a leading platform for professional artists, individual creators and brands looking to distribute their work to consumers looking for an easy, entertaining and unique way to express their voice, individuality and essence, it\u2019s premature to conclude this as being the case.\nAlthough Zedge Premium\u2019s gross transaction revenue has shown modest growth it is still too early to state with conviction that Zedge Premium will have a materially positive impact on our business. In order to do so, we still need, among other things, to:\n\u25cf demonstrate that a critical mass of artists, individual creators and brands will offer their content to our Zedge App\u2019s users;\n\u25cf continue to add new premium content verticals, with ample content in each vertical, to secure end-user demand and consumption;\n\u25cf create a reliable and attractive web-based offering and successfully market it to both creators and consumers;\n\u25cf continue to ensure that we build best-of-breed tools for Zedge Premium content creators that, amongst other things, meet their needs and properly address marketing, distribution, monetization, reporting, support, and ease of use;\n\u25cf continue to develop a wide array of monetization mechanisms Zedge Premium creators in order to optimize revenue generation;\n\u25cf continue evolving \u2018NFTs Made Easy\u2019, our NFT platform, in order to meet the needs of both creators and consumers;\n\u25cf successfully market Zedge Premium to the creative community and secure their adoption as a must-have in their omnichannel distribution mix;\n\u25cf effectively market and convert GuruShots\u2019 players into Zedge Premium artists;\n\u25cf establish that Zedge Premium can be valuable to a sufficient number of creators in achieving their marketing and monetization objectives; and\n\u25cf continue to offer an excellent and differentiated consumer experience in Zedge Premium, including all end-user facing attributes ranging from the user interface to customer support.\nIf Zedge Premium fails to yield the strategic goals and objectives that we envision, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may fail to develop popular new features or expand into new verticals, successfully, negatively impacting our ability to attract new users or retain existing users, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and result of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING MATTERS\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business with past results not necessarily being indicative for future operating results and may increase your investment risk.\nWe have only a limited operating history, especially with respect to Emojipedia and GuruShots, upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. Although we experienced impressive year-over-year revenue growth of 36% and 107% in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively, our growth in fiscal 2020 was moderate and even declined in fiscal 2019. Impacting the growth figures is the inclusion of Emojipedia for fiscal 2022 and GuruShots for the final two months of fiscal 2022. We have encountered and will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early-stage companies in rapidly evolving industries, like mobile apps, digital marketplaces and gaming, including the need to:\n\u25cf accurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\n\u25cf hire, integrate, and retain key personnel;\n\u25cf successfully integrate and realize the benefits of the acquisitions that we have made;\n\u25cf develop a scalable technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably address increased usage, as well as new features and services;\n\u25cf comply with existing and new laws and regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf anticipate and effectively respond to the global economy and the markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf establish and expand our various digital brands;\n\u25cf maintain our reputation and build trust with users, artists, advertisers and employees;\n\u25cf offer competitive economics to advertisers and users alike;\n\u25cf maintain and expand revenue producing initiatives including ad sales, in-app purchases and subscriptions;\n\u25cf deliver superior experiences and results for users, artists and advertisers alike;\n\u25cf identify, attract, retain and motivate new user and artists; and\n\u25cf manage our expanding operations.\nIf we do not successfully address any or all of these risks, our business, revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nAlthough we had positive cash flow from operating activities and net earnings in fiscal 2021 and 2022, we had previously incurred, and may once again incur, net losses and experience negative cash flow from operating activities in the future and may not be able to obtain additional capital in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur net income in fiscal 2022 was $9.7 million and $8.2 million in fiscal 2021 compared to net loss of $0.6 million in fiscal 2020. Our ability to maintain profitability and positive cash flow from operating activities depends on various factors, including but not limited to, the acceptance of our products and services by mobile phone and internet users, the growth and maintenance of our user base, user acquisition spend and associated return, our ability to maintain existing and obtain new advertisers, our ability to grow our revenues, the success of each of our digital brands as measured by their respective key performance indicators, the effectiveness of our new product initiatives, selling and marketing activities as well as control our costs and expenses. We may not be able to sustain profitability or positive cash flow from operating activities, and any such positive cash flow may not be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated capital expenditures and other cash needs. As such, we may not be able to fund our operating expenses and expenditures out of cash flows, which would require us to utilize debt or equity financing which we may not be able to secure or which we may only secure on terms that are not favorable, which may result in significant dilution or voluntary or involuntary dissolution or liquidation proceeding of us and a total loss of your investment.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our various brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our various digital brands and associated reputation is important to the success of our business. Historically, we have not made material investments in this effort. We believe that a well-recognized and respected brand is important to increasing the number of users and enhancing our attractiveness to users, artists, advertisers and business partners. Brand recognition and enhancement may directly affect our ability to maintain our market position.\nMany factors, some of which are beyond our control, are important to maintaining and enhancing our various brands and may negatively impact our brand and reputation if not properly managed, such as our ability to:\n\u25cf maintain an easy and reliable user experience as user preferences evolve and as our brands expand into new service categories and new service lines;\n\u25cf remain relevant to users who can turn to other providers for digital content and marketplaces and mobile games;\n\u25cf increase brand awareness among existing and potential users, advertisers and content providers through various marketing and promotional activities;\n\u25cf adopt new technologies or adapt our products and services to meet user needs or emerging industry standards; and\n\u25cf distinguish us from the competition and maintain this distinction.\nIn the future, we may conduct various marketing and brand promotion activities to expand our brand. Some of these may require material investment. We cannot assure you, however, that these activities will be successful or that we will be able to achieve the brand promotion effect we expect. In addition, any negative publicity in relation to our mobile internet products, websites or services could harm our brand and reputation.\nWe have received, and expect to continue to receive, complaints from users regarding the quality of our products and services. If our users\u2019 complaints are not addressed to their satisfaction, our reputation and our market position could be significantly harmed, which may materially and adversely affect our business, revenues and profitability.\nDebt obligations could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or to fund our operations and also exposes us to interest rate risk which could negatively impact our ability to make debt service payments. In addition, we are subject to obligations and restrictive covenants under our loan from Bridge Bank that may curtail our ability to operate or which we may not be able to maintain compliance with.\nWe maintain a loan facility with Western Alliance Bank with a new term loan facility in the maximum principal amount of $7,000,000 for a four-year term and a $4,000,000 revolving credit facility for a two-year term.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, research and development, strategic initiatives or other purposes;\n\u25cf make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, financial covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and that, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploring;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic industry and competitive conditions;\n\u25cf restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, engaging in development activities, introducing new technologies, or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u25cf potentially limit the amount of net interest expense that we and our subsidiaries can use in the future as a deduction against taxable income under applicable tax laws;\n\u25cf limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, make investments or dispose of assets;\n\u25cf limit our ability to repurchase shares and pay cash dividends; and\n\u25cf expose us to the risk of increased interest rates.\nIn addition, our credit agreement contains financial and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest, including our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf incur additional debt under certain circumstances;\n\u25cf create or incur certain liens or permit them to exist;\n\u25cf enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions;\n\u25cf make certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u25cf consolidate, merge or otherwise transfer, sell or dispose of our assets;\n\u25cf pay dividends, repurchase stock and make other certain restricted payments; or\n\u25cf enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates.\nOur failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness. In the event of such default, the Bank could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nChanges in accounting principles or their application could result in accounting charges or effects which could adversely affect our operating results and prospects.\nWe prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accounting for our business is subject to change based on how the business model evolves, interpretation of various accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting and financial reporting requirements of the SEC or other regulatory agencies. A change in any of these principles or in their interpretations or application to our business, may have a significant effect on our reported results, as well as our processes and related controls, and may retroactively affect previously reported periods, which may negatively impact our financial statements our business prospects. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles and accounting policies over financial reporting, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could require significant investment in systems and personnel.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could suffer and lower the expectations of equity analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nOur preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. For example, we make certain assumptions about the interpretation of these principles and accounting treatment of our useful lives of tangible and intangible assets, fair value of contingent consideration, and allowance for credit losses. If these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, the outcomes may be materially higher or lower than expected for current and future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our reported earnings. We base estimates and assumptions on historical experience, research, and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not accessible from alternative sources. We also may make estimates regarding activities for which the accounting treatment is still evolving. Actual results may differ from those estimates. If our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions, our operating results may be adversely affected and could negatively impact investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nWe had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, and if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe are required to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Likewise, we are required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2021, we reported that we had a material weakness related to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets (see Item 9A Control and Procedures). Remediation of the weakness was completed during the quarterly period ended April 30, 2022. Management and our Audit Committee will monitor remedial measures and the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures.\nWhile we aim to work diligently to ensure a robust internal control that is devoid of significant deficiencies and material weaknesses, given the complexity of the accounting rules, we may, in the future, identify additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated under Section 404. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price. See Item 9A Controls and Procedures for a further discussion of our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nAlthough we believe that our remediation efforts strengthened our internal controls over financial reporting and address the concern that gave rise to the material weakness as of July 31, 2021, we cannot be certain that our expanded knowledge and revised internal control practices will ensure that we maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The New York Stock Exchange, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nChanges in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings, or the examination of our tax positions, could materially affect our financial condition, effective tax rate, future profitability and results of operations.\nTax laws may change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner that we believe comply with current prevailing tax laws. However, the tax positions that we take advantage of could be undermined due to changing tax laws, both in the United States and in other applicable jurisdictions, including Norway, Lithuania, and Israel. In addition, the tax authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate regularly examine income and other tax returns and we expect that they may examine our income and other tax returns. The ultimate outcome of these examinations may not benefit our business.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 16.3% compared and 24.5% for fiscal 2021. In general, changes in applicable U.S. federal and state and foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our tax expense. In addition, and in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the global spread of COVID-19, taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may propose changes to their tax laws and regulations. These potential changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, long-term tax planning and financial results.\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profits Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. In 2021, more than 140 countries tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions. As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which includes business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which may apply to our business.\nEffective January 1, 2022, pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, R&D expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for US tax purposes, which will delay the deductibility of these expenses and potentially increase the amount of cash taxes we pay.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe have significant operations in Europe and Israel that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Norwegian Krone, Euro and Israel Shekel, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus these currencies impacts the expenses generated in these foreign currencies when converted into the U.S. Dollar. In fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, we recorded a loss of $281,000 and $2,000, respectively, from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. Dollar. Included in these amounts were losses from hedging activities of $368,000 and $18,000 in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results.\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations, meet our reporting obligations or prevent fraud.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on Form 10-K. In addition, should we become an accelerated filer, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, our reporting obligations may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to timely complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation.\nDuring the course of documenting and testing our internal control procedures, in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404, we may identify weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, and we may be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods, any of which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, harm our results of operations, and lead to a decline in the trading price of our stock.\nAdditionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth or implement our future business strategies, in which case our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to effectively and efficiently grow each of the properties in our brand portfolio.\nWe may not be capable of growing our business organically or with paid marketing campaigns, attract new players and artists and/or establish cooperation with strategic partners. Our business has experienced periods of rapid growth and expansion that has placed, and continues to place, significant strain on our management and resources. We cannot assure you that these periods will recur or be sustainable. We have also acquired other companies and made asset purchases and integrating those into Zedge has placed and continues to place significant strain on management and resources. We believe that continued growth of our business will depend on our ability to successfully develop and enhance our products and services, cost efficiently attract new artists and individual creators, maintain our relationship with various artists and content partners like Google, Twitter and Apple, sustain our high rankings with the leading search engines including Google, capture the changes that are taking place in the industry in a timely fashion grow our user base, retain existing users, continue developing innovative technologies in response to user demand, increase brand awareness through marketing and promotional activities, react to changes in market trends, expand into new market segments, attract new advertisers, retain existing advertisers, get users to engage with our digital properties and convert into paying users or subscribers, and take advantage of the growth in the relevant markets. We cannot assure you that we will achieve any or all of the above. In the event that we are not successful in some or all of these areas we may not be able to retain our customers and advertisers.\nWe may need to invest in paid user acquisition in order to grow our customer base. However, we may not be able to secure new users at scale with a positive return on investment. Even if we can secure new profitable customers these customers may not mature into sustainable long-term customers.\nTo manage our growth and for us to attain and maintain profitability, we will also need to further expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce across multiple geographies and manage our relationships with users, consultants, business partners and advertisers globally. We anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of enhanced and upgraded operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, including the improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems. All of these endeavors involve risks and will require substantial management efforts and skills and additional expenditures.\nOur products currently enjoy a global customer base. This geographic diversity may raise the level of difficulty in managing future growth and profitability. We cannot assure you that our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our growth or implement our future business strategies effectively, and failure to do so may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDuring the past five years, we have experienced a shift in our Zedge App\u2019s regional customer make-up with the portion of our total MAU from emerging markets increasing, and the portion from well-developed markets decreasing. In fiscal 2022, our Zedge App\u2019s users in emerging markets declined by 4.6% while its users in well-developed regions declined 14.1% when compared to fiscal 2021. India comprised 28.4% of our MAU as of July 31, 2022. This shift has negatively impacted revenues because well-developed markets command materially higher advertising rates when compared to those in emerging markets. Although we are investing in reversing this trend, we may not be successful in this effort which may result in lower revenues and profitability.\nIn 2021 Apple released iOS 14 which started requiring users to opt in to share their identifier for advertisers IDFA with app developers. Apple\u2019s IDFA is a unique string of alphanumeric characters assigned to Apple devices which advertisers use to identify app users in order to deliver personalized and targeted advertising. According to Statista the worldwide opt-in rate enabling app tracking after the release of iOS 14 was less than 25%. As a consequence, the ability of advertisers to accurately target and measure their advertising campaigns at the user level has become significantly more difficult typically resulting in higher user acquisition costs.\nOur products may contain errors, flaws or failures that may only become apparent after their release. From time to time, we receive user feedback in connection with errors, flaws or failures and such errors, flaws or failures may also come to our attention during our internal testing process. We generally have been able to resolve such errors, flaws or failures in a timely manner, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to detect and resolve all of them effectively or in a timely manner. Errors, flaws or failures in our services and products may adversely affect user experience and cause our users to stop using our services and products, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur products face competition in all aspects of its business. If our apps fail to compete effectively or if their reputation is damaged, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough our products are leaders in their specific verticals, including mobile phone personalization, emoji related content and information, and digital photo competitions, we cannot guarantee that our brands will be able to maintain their leadership position. Our products face potential competition from other internet companies, app developers and smartphone manufacturers, and new market entrants may also emerge. If we are not able to differentiate our products from that of our competitors, drive value for our customers, and/or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our business. Increased competition may result in new products and offerings which may in turn require us to take actions to retain and attract our users and advertisers in such a fashion which would lower our gross margins. If we fail to compete effectively, our market share would decrease and our results from operations, revenues and profits would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are attempting to expand our Zedge Premium marketplace where professional artists, individual creators and brands offer their content to our users. We aspire to be a popular destination that users turn to when looking for high quality digital content, including NFTs. If we are unsuccessful in meeting our goal, our business may suffer resulting in diluting our value proposition, losing MAU and having lower revenues and profits.\nIf we are not able to effectively compete in any aspect of our business or if our reputation is harmed by rumors or allegations regarding our business or business practices, our overall user base may decline, making it less attractive to advertisers. We may be required to spend additional resources to further increase our brand recognition and promote our products and services, and such additional spending could adversely affect our profitability.\nIf we fail to keep up with rapid technological changes in the internet and smartphone industries and adapt our products and services accordingly, our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected.\nThe internet and smartphone industries are characterized by rapid and innovative technological changes. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond to fast changing technologies, adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and improve the performance, functionality and reliability of our products and services. Our failure to continue to adapt to such changes could harm our business. If we are slow to develop products and services that are compatible with smartphones, or if the products and services we develop are not widely accepted and used by smartphone users, we may not be able to capture a significant share of this important market. In addition, the widespread adoption of new internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes for smartphones could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our products, services or infrastructure. If we fail to keep up with rapid and innovative technological changes to remain competitive, our future growth may be materially and adversely affected and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition to uncertainty about our ability to continue expanding and monetizing internationally, our foreign operations may subject us to additional risks including:\n\u25cf difficulties in developing, staffing, traveling to and simultaneously managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u25cf tariffs, trade barriers, customs classifications and changes in trade regulations. For example, in May 2019, the United States banned U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei, a major smartphone manufacturer, in 2020 the United States threatened to ban TikTok from operating in the U.S. market, and in 2022 the United States imposed broad-ranging economic sanctions against Russia and Belarus because of Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of the Ukraine;\n\u25cf stringent local labor laws and regulations;\n\u25cf the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u25cf strict and unclear laws around data privacy;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u25cf profit repatriation restrictions and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\u25cf political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;\n\u25cf geopolitical events, including natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism;\n\u25cf import or export regulations;\n\u25cf compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting bribery and corrupt payments to government officials;\n\u25cf antitrust and competition regulations;\n\u25cf potentially adverse tax developments;\n\u25cf seasonal volatility in business activity and local economic conditions;\n\u25cf economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt;\n\u25cf laws, regulations, licensing requirements, and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit foreign ownership or investments;\n\u25cf laws, regulations or rulings that block or limit access to our products;\n\u25cf different, uncertain or more stringent user protection, content, data protection, privacy, intellectual property and other laws; and\n\u25cf risks related to other government regulation, required compliance with local laws or lack of legal precedent.\nFurther, our ability to expand successfully in foreign jurisdictions involves other risks, including challenges in integrating foreign operations, risks associated with entering jurisdictions in which we may have little experience and the day-to-day management of a growing and increasingly geographically diverse company. We may not realize the operating efficiencies, competitive advantages or financial results that we anticipate from our investments in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our international business operations could be interrupted and negatively impacted by terrorist activity, war, political unrest or other economic or political uncertainties. Moreover, foreign jurisdictions could impose tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions on our international sales.\nWe are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that increase our cost of doing business. Violations of these complex laws and regulations that apply to our international operations could result in damages, awards, fines, litigation, criminal actions, sanctions, or penalties against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and our ability to offer products and services, and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies or that our policies will be sufficient. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and could result in material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe have offices and other significant operations located in Lithuania, Israel, and Norway, and, therefore, our results may be adversely affected by political, economic and military instability in these countries.\nThe overwhelming majority of our employees are located in Lithuania, Israel, and Norway and many of our senior managers live in Israel or Lithuania. For those that reside in Israel and Lithuania political, economic and military conditions directly affect our business. Any hostilities involving these countries or the interruption or curtailment of trade between these countries and their trading partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, there is always the chance that the citizens in these countries will be required to serve in the army or perform public duty in the event of an armed conflict.\nThe State of Israel has had various armed conflicts with its neighbors as well as terrorist acts committed within Israel by hostile elements. In addition, recent political uprisings and conflicts in various countries in the Middle East, including Syria, are affecting the political stability of those countries. In addition, the threats that Iran and various extremist groups in the region make against Israel may escalate in the future and turn violent, which could affect the Israeli economy in general and us in particular. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions, harm our results of operations and make it harder for us to raise capital.\nFor the most part, we do not have commercial insurance that cover losses that may occur as a result of an event associated with the security situation in either of these locations. Although the Israeli government has in the past covered the reinstatement value of certain damages that were caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained or, if maintained, will be sufficient to compensate us fully for damages incurred. Any losses or damages incurred would likely cause a significant disruption in our employees\u2019 lives and possibly put their lives at risk, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would likely negatively affect business conditions generally and could harm our results of operations.\nAdditionally, in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to economic boycotts. Several countries still restrict business with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial conditions or the expansion of our business. A campaign of boycotts, divestment and sanctions has been undertaken against Israel, which could also adversely impact our business.\nThe Republic of Lithuania borders both the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and the Republic of Belarus, who are aligned in Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of the Ukraine. This places Lithuania at a higher risk of military conflict, may negatively impact the ability to travel to and from Lithuania, and may damage the economy. This action also negatively impacted GuruShots because it utilizes a small number of outsourced contractors based in the Ukraine. This resulted in temporarily disrupting the work product associated with these contractors at the outset of the war.\nCompanies and governmental agencies may restrict access to our website or mobile apps, or the internet generally, which could lead to the loss or slower growth of our user base, in which case our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn order to grow our business, users need to access the internet and, in particular, our digital products. Companies and governmental agencies could block access to our websites and apps or the internet generally. For example, in 2013 the Indian courts issued orders restraining internet service providers from providing access to various internet domains including ours. Access to our Zedge App through any mode was blocked in many parts of India from February 2013 until August 2019 and there can be no guaranties that this will not recur or happen elsewhere. If companies or governmental entities block or limit access to our Zedge App or otherwise adopt policies restricting access to our advertiser\u2019s products and services our business could be negatively impacted resulting in a loss or slow-down of user growth and/or revenues.\nOur core values of focusing on our users and acting for the long-term may conflict with the short-term interests of our business.\nOne of our core values is providing an excellent user experience, which we believe is essential to our success and serves the best, long-term interests of us and our stockholders. Therefore, we have made, in the past and/or may make in the future, significant investments or changes in strategy that we think will benefit our users, even if our decision negatively impacts our operating results in the short term. In addition, our philosophy of prioritizing our users may cause disagreements or negatively impact our relationships with advertisers or other third parties. Our decisions may not result in the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case the success of our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Such employees, particularly product managers, designers and engineers, are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating and retaining these employees. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled employees as necessary could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause additional disruptions to our business.\nWe operate a development center in Vilnius, Lithuania. If we are unable to recruit and retain well qualified candidates at an attractive rate or manage them well, our business will struggle to meet our development goals and objectives. In fiscal 2021 we adopted a \u201cremote-first\u201d work policy that enables employees to work from home unless they are needed in the office. Although this policy has been well received by employees, it is as of yet unclear whether it will be revised as many businesses have been returning to an office environment as a result of better public health measures relating to Covid management.\nIn April of 2022 we completed the acquisition of GuruShots Ltd, an Israeli based company. GuruShots utilized a small number of outsourced contractors based in the Ukraine. Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of the Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in temporarily disrupting the work product associated with these contractors. Furthermore, Zedge employees situated in Vilnius were distracted due to the proximity to the Belarusian border and uncertainty related to Belarus\u2019 complicity with Russia\u2019s illegal action and associated intent. In addition, consumer prices have risen materially throughout the Eurozone leaving uncertainty about how this may impact employment costs in the future.\nWe believe that two critical components of our success are our ability to retain our best people by preserving our culture and maintaining competitive compensation practices. As we continue to grow rapidly, and we develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition, depending on the performance of our stock price some of our employees are able to receive material proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us.\nWe rely on third parties to provide the technologies, including cloud services, necessary to deliver content, advertising, and services to our users, and any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability, or acceptance of these formats and technologies could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur service and hosting providers may experience downtime from time to time, which may negatively affect our brand and user perception of the reliability of our service. Any scheduled or unscheduled interruptions in service could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues. Although we seek to reduce the possibility of disruptions or other outages, our websites and apps may be disrupted by problems relating either to our own technology or third-party technology that is used for them. Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from telecommunication failures, power loss, computer attacks or viruses, earthquakes, floods, fires, terrorist attacks and similar events. Parts of our system are not fully redundant or backed up, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Despite any precaution we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our products. Any interruption in the ability of users to access our websites or apps could reduce our future revenues, harm our future profits, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and lead users to seek alternative internet mobile products.\nThere can be no assurance that these providers will continue licensing their technologies or intellectual property to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Providers may change the fees they charge users or otherwise change their business model in a manner that slows the widespread acceptance of their technologies. Any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability, or user acceptance of these technologies could materially and adversely affect our business, revenues and profitability.\nIn January 2022, AppLovin a mobile technology company that enables developers of all sizes to market, monetize, analyze and publish their apps through its mobile advertising, marketing, and analytics platforms consummated the acquisition of mobile monetization company MoPub from Twitter. MoPub had been our ad mediation platform for the past ten years. At the time of the acquisition, AppLovin announced that it would deprecate MoPub\u2019s mediation platform. This resulted in Zedge needing to migrate to a different mediation platform. This unanticipated migration required material resource and time investment that delayed the delivery of other product initiatives we had planned for.\nWe track certain key performance indicators with internal and third-party tools and do not independently verify that all of this data accurate. Certain of these indicators may have challenges in being tracked accurately which could result in real or perceived inaccuracies that could negatively impact our business.\nWe track certain key performance indicators, including daily active users, monthly active users, purchasers, and paying subscribers using both internal and third-party tracking tools. Our analytical tools have certain limitations, including those from third-party providers, and our ability to access and monitor this data may change, which would adversely impact our ability to track these KPIs. If the internal or external tools we use to track data contain bugs we may make poor decisions, especially when it comes to paid user acquisition, based on flawed and inaccurate data which can hurt our reputation and financial position.\nWe use open-source software in our platform that may subject our technology to general release or require us to re-engineer our solutions, which may cause materially harm to our business.\nWe use open-source software in connection with our services. From time to time, companies that incorporate open-source software into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open-source software and/or compliance with open-source license terms. Therefore, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or noncompliance with open-source licensing terms. Some open-source software licenses require users who distribute or make available open-source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open-source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open-source agreement, such use could nevertheless occur and we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our applications, discontinue use in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur business, results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected by the Covid 19 pandemic, other global epidemics and the restrictions put in place in connection therewith and/or the loosening of such restrictions could adversely impact our business.\nPandemics, epidemics, medical emergencies and other public health crises outside of our control could have a negative impact on our business. Large-scale medical emergencies can take many forms and result in widespread business interruptions due to illness and death. For example, in December 2019, a strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China soon evolving into a global pandemic without proven medical treatments or vaccines for prevention. When vaccines started to become available demand for the vaccines exceeded the supply in the countries in which we operate. Furthermore, the vaccines were not fully effective in preventing illness. All of these factors introduced challenges in operating our business including the productivity of our employees and third-party vendors that we depend on while adjusting to shelter-in-place and health regulations. We also had to comply with an assortment of regulations specific to returning to our offices, creating additional uncertainty and confusion.\nWidespread pandemics, epidemics or other health crises could result in significant market volatility, regionally or globally. Furthermore, health crises may disrupt or negatively impact behaviors of large numbers of users or potential users due to either mandated stay at home orders or the lifting of such orders or non-mandated changes in consumer behavior. These changes are almost impossible to predict and could either serve to accelerate, slow down or make user behavior more volatile which could negatively impact our operating results.\nIn the event of a new coronavirus surge or other health emergency we plan to execute to the best of our ability recognizing that the nature and scope of the crisis may result in delays or changes to our goals and initiatives.\nOur business is subject to economic, market, and geopolitical conditions as well as to cyber-attacks and natural disasters beyond our control.\nOur business is subject to economic, market, and geopolitical conditions, as well as natural disasters beyond our control and as a result we may experience a slowdown or cessation in customer growth, interruptions or delays in the services or a downturn in user. Further, our revenue is driven in part by discretionary consumer spending habits and by advertising spend. Historically, consumer purchasing and advertising spend have each declined during economic downturns and periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty or when disposable income or consumer lending is declines. Macro-economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in well developed markets, specifically, and emerging markets, more generally may result in uncertainty and adversely affect discretionary consumer spending habits and preferences as well as advertising spend. Uncertain economic conditions may also adversely affect our vendors making it virtually impossible to grow in the event of future economic malaise. We are particularly susceptible to market conditions and risks associated with the mobile app ecosystem, which also include the popularity, price, and timing of our apps, changes in user demographics, the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment. Furthermore, critical reviews and general tastes and preferences may change quickly and without prior warning.\nZedge may experience a material downturn in its business making it impossible to meet, or other factors may prevent us from meeting, the user acquisition spend obligations that we have made to the sellers of GuruShots.\nIn connection with the acquisition of GuruShots, the Company has (i) committed to a retention pool of $4 million in cash to be paid to the founders and employees of GuruShots that will be payable over three years from closing of the acquisition based on the beneficiaries thereof remaining employed by the Company or a subsidiary; and (ii) agreed to make certain minimum investments in user acquisition for GuruShots in the period covered by the earnout to be contingently paid to the prior owners of GuruShots subject to GuruShots maintaining agreed upon levels of return on ad spend (ROAS). In the event that there is a material economic setback or another catastrophic event that negatively impacts advertising spend we may be unable to meet our user acquisition spend obligations.\nOther factors, including those related to GuruShots\u2019 operations, may also prevent us from making the committed user acquisition spend commitments, and the current levels of spend would not meet the commitments.\nAlthough we believe that we have acted in compliance with our obligations, we could be exposed to liability to the prior owners of GuruShots.\nZedge may be unable to successfully integrate GuruShots into Zedge.\nZedge and GuruShots will need to integrate their operations which will require coordination between management, marketing, technology, product development, and operations. Zedge may not execute the integration successfully resulting in higher costs, product delays, employee resignations, and overall underperformance.\nThe GuruShots acquisition may fail to yield growth opportunities and achieve beneficial synergies.\nZedge acquired GuruShots with the expectation that the transaction will yield growth on a standalone basis as well as strategic synergies on a combined basis. Our success in realizing these growth opportunities and strategic synergies, and their associated timing depends, amongst other things, on the successful integration of the respective businesses. Even if we are successful with the integration, there is no guarantee that the strategic synergies that we envisioned will bear fruit.\nFuture strategic alliances or acquisitions may not be successful and may have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe may enter into strategic alliances, including joint ventures or minority equity investments, or acquisitions with various third parties to further our business purpose from time to time. These alliances and acquisitions could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance by the third party and increased expenses in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business. We may have limited ability to monitor or control the actions of these third parties and, to the extent any of these strategic third parties suffer negative publicity or harm to their reputation from events relating to their business, we may also suffer negative publicity or harm to our reputation by virtue of our association with any such third party.\nIn addition, if appropriate opportunities arise, we may acquire additional assets, products, technologies or businesses that we believe are complementary to our existing business. Future acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into our own would require significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business operations. Acquired assets or businesses may not generate the financial results we expect and could require the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of significant goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses for other intangible assets and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business. Moreover, the costs of identifying and consummating acquisitions may be significant. In addition to possible stockholders\u2019 approval, we may also have to obtain approvals and licenses from relevant government authorities for the acquisitions and to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased delay and costs.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nLegal or regulatory proceedings or allegations of impropriety could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe have been party to and in the future may become subject to new legal proceedings in the operation of our business, including, but not limited to, with respect to alleged breaches of consumer privacy regulations, employee matters, alleged service and system malfunctions, alleged intellectual property violations and claims relating to our contracts, licenses and strategic investments. Furthermore, we may be included in lawsuits as third-party defendants due to the use of products or services of the primary defendant. We may also be subject to fraudulent claims from parties like patent trolls.\nAdditional legal proceedings targeting our products and services and claiming violations of state or federal laws could occur, based on the unique and particular laws of each jurisdiction, particularly as litigation claims and regulations continue to evolve. We cannot predict the outcome of any legal proceedings to which we may be a party, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nA variety of new and existing U.S. and foreign government laws and regulations could subject us to claims, judgments, monetary liabilities and other remedies, and to limitations on our business practices, in which case our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations or the interpretation of them, our introduction of new products, or an extension of our business into new areas, could increase our future compliance costs, make our products and services less attractive to our users, or cause us to change or limit our business practices. We may incur substantial expenses to comply with laws and regulations or defend against a claim that we have not complied with them. Further, any failure on our part to comply with any relevant laws or regulations may subject us to significant civil or criminal liabilities, penalties, taxes, fees, costs and negative publicity.\nThe application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations to us relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection, security, defamation, pricing, advertising, taxation, gambling, sweepstakes, promotions, consumer protection, accessibility, content regulation, quality of services, law enforcement demands, telecommunications, mobile, and intellectual property ownership and infringement in many instances is unclear or unsettled. Further, the application to us or our subsidiaries of existing laws regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers can be unclear. U.S. export control laws and regulations also impose requirements and restrictions on exports to certain nations and persons and on our business. Internationally, we may also be subject to laws regulating our activities in foreign countries and to foreign laws and regulations that are inconsistent from country to country.\nIn addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for hosting user-generated materials that infringe copyrights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements in the DMCA. Also, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, provides immunity from liability for providers of an interactive computer service who publish defamatory information provided by users of the service. While the immunity provisions of the DMCA and the CDA are well established, there are regular cases seeking to limit the application of such immunity. Various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In the area of data protection, every state has passed a law requiring notification, and at times, the provision of identity theft protection, to users when there is a security breach for personal data. We face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.\nIn many, but not all, territories outside of the United States there are laws similar to the DMCA which exempt us from copyright infringement liability that may arise due to hosting user-uploaded materials. In some countries, particularly in Europe and the APAC region, these laws are being readjusted and new - at times burdensome - constraints are being imposed onto service providers.\nIn June 2019, the European Union\u2019s Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, or the Directive, came into effect, and each of the European Union\u2019s members were supposed to have implemented the Directive by June 2021. To date seven EU Member States (including Germany, the Netherlands, Croatia, Malta, France, Italy and Hungary).\nDirective Article 17 removes the shield of the current \u2018hosting exemption\u2019, enshrined in the E-Commerce Directive, and replaces it with a principle of full liability where \u201conline content sharing service providers\u201d (\u201cOCSSPs\u201d) are concerned. This means that OCSSPs will be liable for copyright-protected material uploaded by users and must obtain authorization (i.e., a license) from the relevant rightsholders. However, Article 17 effectively creates a new liability exemption regime for OCSSPs (albeit a more onerous one than is currently provided by the E-Commerce Directive) under which OCSSPs will not be liable for the copyright-protected works that they communicate to the public provided that they cooperate with rightsholders by:\n\u25cf making best efforts to obtain the necessary authorization (i.e., a license);\n\u25cf expeditiously taking down or disabling access to content upon receiving a sufficiently substantiated notice to do so by rightsholders (i.e., similar to the existing \u2018notice and take-down\u2019 requirements);\n\u25cf making best efforts to prevent future uploads of content in respect of which they have received a notice from rightsholders pursuant to the previous requirement (i.e., a \u2018notice and stay down\u2019 requirement); and\n\u25cf making best efforts, in accordance with high industry standards of professional diligence, to ensure the unavailability of specific works in respect of which rightsholders have provided the \u2018relevant and necessary information\u2019.\nThe article also extends any licenses granted to OCSSPs to their users, as long as those users are not acting \u201con a commercial basis\u201d.\nAlthough we have invested and continue to invest in systems and resources, which are intended to ensure that we are compliant with the requirements of the GDPR. CCPA, DMCA, the Directive and other U.S. and international laws relating to, among other things, materials that infringe on copyrights and contain other objectionable content, our systems may not be sufficient or we may unintentionally err and fail to comply with these laws and regulations which could expose us to claims, judgments, monetary liabilities and other remedies, and to limitations on our business practices which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nData privacy and security laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business subject us to possible sanctions, civil lawsuits (including class action or similar representative lawsuits) and other penalties in the event of non-compliance, additionally the need to observe these regulations increases the cost of doing business and these laws and regulations are continually evolving. Compliance failure either by us or our partners, or vendors could harm our business.\nOur business relies on collecting, processing, storing, using and sharing data, some of which contains personal information, including the personal information of our users. Our business is therefore subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, regulatory codes and guidelines governing data privacy, data protection and security, including with respect to the collection, storage, use, processing, transmission, sharing and protection of personal information. Such laws, regulations, regulatory codes and guidelines may be inconsistent across jurisdictions or conflict with other rules and change regularly.\nOn July 16, 2020, rulings from the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as a lawful means for transferring personal data from the European Economic Area, or the EEA, or the United Kingdom to the United States. The court upheld that the Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d), can act as a valid transfer mechanism for personal data transfer, but that additional measures may be required to ensure adequate protection of personal data. To rely on SCCs, a data exporter must verify that the jurisdiction in which the data importer is based offers adequate protection for personal data. Data exporters may also need to put in place additional measures to deal with any risks associated with data transfer, such as technical controls and additional contractual obligations on how to manage onward transfers and compelled disclosures to public authorities. Undertaking such assessments and implementing additional measures could restrict our business operations and require us to incur additional costs for compliance.\nFollowing the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU, the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR, have been incorporated directly into UK law as the \u201cUK GDPR\u201d. In practice, there is little change to the core data protection principles, rights and obligations under UK data protection law. On June 28, 2021, the EU approved the United Kingdom\u2019s adequacy decision, meaning data can continue to flow between the United Kingdom and EEA as it did prior to Brexit, in most circumstances. There is a possibility that the United Kingdom may adopt regulations that diverge from the EU and that require a different compliance regime and that carry different penalties in the event of a breach which could increase our future compliance costs.\nIn addition to the actual and potential changes to laws and regulations described elsewhere in these Risk Factors, compliance with privacy and data security regulations, particularly within the EU, is likely to require ongoing investment and changes in how we operate. For example, in May 2018 the EU implemented the GDPR, whose goal is to provide a uniform standard for data protection and privacy for all individuals in the EU and EEA, including both end-users and employees. GDPR compliance required us to invest a considerable amount of resources in fiscal 2018 in addition to adopting new operational procedures in order to assure ongoing compliance.\nIn 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which is a privacy law that provides consumers significant rights over the use of their personal information, including the right to object to the \u201csale\u201d of their personal information. Amendments to the CCPA under the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) which will take effect in 2023 expand some of the CCPA rights to residents to restrict the use of certain information. These rights may restrict our ability to use personal information in connection with our business operations. The CCPA also provides a private right of action for security breaches. Colorado and Virginia have passed privacy bills similar to the CCPA which will go into effect in 2023. Washington, Massachusetts and other states have introduced privacy bills and the U.S. Congress is debating federal privacy legislation, which if passed, may restrict our business operations and require us to incur additional costs for compliance. While we carefully consider the compliance mandates of the GDPR and CCPA/CPRA, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our business practices.\nIn recent years, the United States and European lawmakers and regulators have voiced concern about electronic marketing and the use of third-party cookies and similar technology for online behavioral advertising. In the European Union, marketing is defined broadly to include any promotional material and the rules specifically on e-marketing are currently set out in the ePrivacy Directive which is expected to be replaced by a new ePrivacy Regulation in 2023. While the ePrivacy Regulation was originally intended to be adopted on in May of 2018 it is still making its way through the European legislative process. The current draft of the ePrivacy Regulation imposes strict opt-in e-marketing rules with limited exceptions for business-to-business communications and significantly increases fining powers to the same levels as the GDPR. Regulation of cookies may result in broader restrictions on our online activities, including efforts to understand followers\u2019 internet usage and promote ourselves to them.\nIn addition, Lithuania, Israel, and Norway, each have unique data privacy regulations that impact how and what we can do with employee data and require local compliance efforts.\nEfforts to comply with these and other data privacy and security restrictions that may be adopted could require us to modify our data processing practices and policies increasing the cost of our operations. Failure to comply could subject us to criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. In part due to the uncertainty of the legal climate, complying with regulations, and any applicable rules or guidance from regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations relating to privacy, data protection, information security and consumer protection, may result in substantial costs and may require changes to our business practices, which may limit our growth strategy, adversely impact our ability to attract or retain players, and otherwise negatively affect our business, reputation, legal exposure, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure or perceived compliance failure with our posted privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or any other legal obligations or regulatory requirements relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may result in official investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, legal claims, or negative publicity from consumer advocacy groups or the press and could result in significant liability, cause our users to lose trust in us to the point of severing their relationship with us, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to us may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our products and services. Additionally, service providers or other third parties that we work with, violate applicable laws, regulations, or agreements, such violations may put our users\u2019 and/or employees\u2019 data at risk, could result in formal investigations or enforcement actions, fines, litigation, claims or negative publicity from consumer advocacy groups or the press and could result in significant liability, cause our players to lose trust in us and otherwise materially and adversely affect our reputation and business. Further, public scrutiny of data practices and privacy, or complaints about, such practices, especially when lodged against technology companies, may heighten the chances for an official investigation and result in modifications to existing or the introduction of new regulatory requirements resulting in higher costs and risks.\nRISKS RELATED TO CONTENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we are unable to license, acquire or otherwise obtain access to compelling content and services at reasonable cost or if we do not develop or commission compelling content of our own, the number of users of our Zedge App may not grow as anticipated, or may decline, or users\u2019 level of engagement with our Zedge App may decline, all or any of which could materially harm our business and operating results.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to aggregate and host compelling content and deliver that content to our users via our digital properties. We achieve this when users play our games, when artists, individual creators and brands upload their licensed content to our marketplace, or when we create content or enter into business partnerships with content owners and distribute this content in our marketplace. In addition we commission authors to write articles for our blog.\nWe believe that users value high-quality content. As such, we may need to make substantial payments to third parties from whom we license or acquire such content from or from whom we create this content for our behalf. Our ability to maintain and build relationships with such third-party providers may become important to our success. As competition for compelling content increases both domestically and internationally, our partners may alter business terms under which they avail their content and services to us and potential providers may not offer their content or services to us at all, or may offer them on terms that are not agreeable to us. A change in these commercial terms could harm our operating results and financial condition. Further, much of the content that we acquire may only be available on a non-exclusive basis allowing competitors the ability of offering this content to our disadvantage.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations, which could require us to pay substantial statutory penalties or other damages and fines, remove relevant content, enter into license agreements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or could result in our being barred from third-party distribution platforms, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nThere may be owners of technology patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and content, who assert claims against us. There may also be laws and regulations that are adopted that change the rules related to the safe harbor for user generated content and ultimately requiring us to pay licensing fees. If a claim of infringement is brought against us, we may be required to pay substantial penalties or other damages and fines, remove relevant content, enter into license agreements that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or be barred from any of the third-party distribution platforms. Even though the allegations or claims could be baseless, our defense against any of these allegations or claims would be both costly and time-consuming and could significantly divert the efforts and resources of our management and other personnel.\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could materially harm our business and competitive position.\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, patents, domain names, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark and patent law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary right. As of July 31, 2022, we have registered, amongst others, the following domain names: www.zedge.net, www.zedge.com, www.emojipedia.com, www.emojipedia.org, and gurushots.com. In addition, we have been granted trademark protection for \u201cZedge\u201d in the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, India, and Canada, \u201cTonesync\u201d in the European Union and the United Kingdom, \u201cWe Make Phones Personal,\u201d and \u201cZedge, Everything You\u201d in the United States, a stylized \u201cD\u201d logo in the European Union and the United Kingdom, \u201cEmojipedia\u201d in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, China and Australia, and \u201cWorld Emoji Day\u201d in the United States and United Kingdom. We have also applied for trademark protection for \u201cTattoo your phone,\u201d and \u201cNFTs Made Easy\u201d in the United States, a stylized \u201cD\u201d logo in the United States, Canada, and India, and \u201cGuruShots\u201d in the United States, and have filed copyright applications for the GuruShots mobile and web-based applications, and have obtained a copyright registration for our flagship app, Zedge.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that we can effectively prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. From time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and may not be successful.\nIn addition, it is often difficult to create and enforce intellectual property rights in certain international markets. Patents, trademarks and service marks may also be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Trade secrets are difficult to protect, and our trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others. Confidentiality agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Even where adequate and relevant laws exist it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of such laws, or to obtain enforcement of a court judgment or an arbitration award delivered in another jurisdiction, and accordingly, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or enforce agreements in such countries.\nOur insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe believe that we maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable or practical to insure. In addition, any loss incurred could exceed policy limits and policy payments made to us may not be made on a timely basis. Such losses could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA SECURITY\nOur business depends on our ability to collect and effectively use data to serve relevant advertising, deliver suitable content, and identify appropriate customer prospects, and any limitation on the collection and use of this data could significantly diminish the value of our services, cause us to lose clients, make us less attractive to prospective customers and revenues.\nWhen one uses our products and services, we may collect both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable data about the user. This may include but is not limited to the user\u2019s name, telephone number, email address, web cookies, Facebook and other login credentials, phone model, operating system, location, Android Advertising ID (\u201cAAID\u201d), Apple\u2019s Identifier for Advertising, IDFA, as well as information relating to their interaction with advertisements and content appearing within our products. Often, we use some of this data to provide a better experience for the user by delivering both relevant content and advertisements. In addition, we use some of this data to help us target prospective customers as well as for advertising reporting purposes.\nAdditionally, internet enabled devices and operating systems are controlled by third parties and in most cases offer options that allow users to disable functionality that allows for the delivery of advertising on their devices. Device and browser manufacturers may include or expand these features as part of their standard device specifications. For example, Apple deprecated UDID, a standard device identifier, ultimately replacing it with IDFA, which makes the process for iPhone users to opt out of behavioral targeting easier. If players elect to opt-out of sharing data about themselves we will be curtailed in our ability to deliver effective which could negatively affect our digital advertising revenues.\nAlthough our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service provide extensive details about how we use customer data our clients may decide not to allow us to collect some or all of this data or may limit how we can use this data. Any limitation on our ability to collect data about user behavior and app interactions would likely make it more difficult for us to deliver germane content to our users and effective mobile advertising campaigns that meet the demands of our advertisers.\nOur contracts with advertisers generally permit us to aggregate data from advertising campaigns, yet these clients might nonetheless request that we discontinue using data obtained from their campaigns that have already been aggregated with other clients\u2019 campaign data. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to comply with these requests, and these kinds of requests could also cause us to invest significant amounts of resources. Interruptions, failures or defects in our data collection, mining, analysis and storage systems, as well as privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions regarding the collection of data, could also limit our ability to aggregate and analyze mobile device user data from our clients\u2019 advertising campaigns. If that happens, we may not be able to optimize the placement of advertising for the benefit of our advertiser clients, which could make our services less valuable, and, as a result, we may lose clients and our revenues may materially decline.\nSecurity breaches or computer virus attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and results of operations.\nAny significant breach of security of our computer systems could significantly harm our business, reputation and results of operations and could expose us to lawsuits brought by our users and partners and to sanctions by governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot assure you that our IT systems or those of third-parties that we depend on will be secure from future security breaches or computer virus attacks. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, including the personal information of our users, obtaining users\u2019 names and passwords and enabling the hackers to access user\u2019s other online and mobile accounts, if those users use identical usernames and passwords. They could also misappropriate other information, including our content. These circumventions may cause interruptions in our operations or damage our brand image and reputation. Our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could cause system interruptions, website slowdown or unavailability, delays in communication or transactions, or loss of data. We may be required to incur significant additional costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. In addition, a significant security breach or virus attack on our system could result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe investment needed to eliminate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be material. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers, users, or creators. As threats related to cyber-attacks continuously evolve and grow, we may also find it necessary to investment additional resources in protecting our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of operations. Although we have insurance coverage protection against cyber-attacks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims stemming from security breaches, cyberattacks and other types of unlawful activity, or any resulting disruptions from such events, and we may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations in the United States, Lithuania, Israel, Norway the European Union, and other jurisdictions, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection.\nIn addition, the platforms that we use to distribute our apps may encourage, or require, compliance with certain security standards, such as the voluntary cybersecurity framework released by the National Institute of Standards and Technology which consists of controls designed to identify and manage cyber-security risks, and we could be negatively impacted to the extent we are unable to comply with such standards.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OWNERSHIP AND OUR CLASS B COMMON STOCK\nWe have granted, and may continue to grant, options, restricted shares and other types of awards under our stock option and equity incentive plans and otherwise, which may result in increased equity-based compensation expenses.\nThe expenses associated with equity-based compensation have affected our net income and may reduce our net income in the future, and any additional equity issued under equity-based compensation schemes will dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. We believe the granting of equity-based compensation is of significant importance to our ability to attract and retain key personnel and employees, consultants and directors, and we will continue to grant equity-based compensation in the future. As a result, our expenses associated with equity-based compensation may increase, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nInvestors may suffer dilution.\nWe may engage in equity financing to fund our future operations and growth or acquisitions. If we raise additional funds and/or provide consideration in acquisitions by issuing equity securities, stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest (both with respect to the percentage of total securities held, and with respect to the book value of their securities) and such securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our Class B common stock.\nFor example, between December 14, 2020 and January 26, 2021, we sold 761,906 shares of our Class B common stock at an average price of $6.5625 per share for total proceeds of $5 million in a registered \u201cAt-the-Market\u201d offering through National Securities Corp. and H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC as sales agents. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes including organic and other growth initiatives.\nIn addition, on March 16, 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement with the Securities and Exchange Commission which contemplates the sale, for a gross aggregate sale price of up to $10,000,000, of shares of our Class B common stock, from time to time in \u201cAt-The-Market\u201d offerings pursuant to an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with National Securities Corporation and Maxim Group LLC dated as of March 16, 2021. Through June 11, 2021, we sold 663,686 shares at an average price of $15.0674 per share for total proceeds of $10 million in this offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes including organic and other growth initiatives.\nA portion of the purchase price for GuruShots may be paid, at the Company\u2019s discretion in Class B common stock and, in connection with the acquisition, the Company committed to issuing 626,242 shares of the Company Class B common stock to serve as a retention pool for GuruShots employees.\nAny such equity financing could occur at prices below, or well below, the then-current trading price of our Class B common stock, which would further exacerbate the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to obtain additional financing, may be adversely affected by downturn in the global economy.\nThe global financial markets have experienced significant disruptions over the past fifteen years and the recoveries from the lows of 2008 and 2009 as well as from the Covid 19 pandemic have been uneven. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world\u2019s leading economies. There have also been concerns over unrest in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in the energy and food sectors amongst other markets. We may be affected by economic downturns. A prolonged slowdown in the world economy may lead to a reduced amount of mobile internet advertising, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, a slowdown or disruption in the global economy may have a material and adverse impact on financings available to us. The weakness in the economy could erode investor confidence, which constitutes the basis of the credit market. Turmoil affecting the financial markets and banking system may significantly restrict our ability to obtain financing in the capital markets or from financial institutions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe trading price of the shares of our Class B common stock may be volatile, and purchasers of our Class B common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price could be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for mobile internet companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their Class B common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our Class B common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u25cf stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that operate in the advertising, internet or media industries;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new product or service offerings, significant acquisitions;\n\u25cf strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u25cf announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u25cf changes to regulations including but not limited to, data privacy, and copyrighted content;\n\u25cf capital commitments;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u25cf sales of our Class B common stock common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against technology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe are controlled by our majority stockholder, which limits the ability of other stockholders to affect our management.\nMichael Jonas is our majority stockholder, Executive Chairman, Chairman of the Board and a director, and, as of November 10, 2022, had voting power over 1,864,673 shares of our Class B common stock (which includes 524,775 shares of our Class A common stock, which are convertible into shares of our Class B common stock on a 1-for-1 basis, and 1,339,898 shares of our Class B common stock), representing approximately 56.7% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Mr. Jonas is able to control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of all of the directors and the approval of significant corporate matters, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As a result, the ability of any of our other stockholders to influence our management is limited.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common Class B common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. Currently, only one investment bank, Maxim Group LLC, publishes equity research about Zedge and there are no guarantees that they will continue providing coverage in the future. We may never obtain research coverage by other equity research analysts. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our Class B common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our Class B common stock. We do not have any control over the equity research analysts or their content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issues other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price and/or trading volume to decline.\nOur results of operations may be subject to wide fluctuations due to a number of factors, which may adversely affect the trading price of our Class B common stock.\nWe may experience seasonality and other fluctuations in our business, reflecting fluctuations in internet and smartphone usage and advertising. Revenues from consumer internet and mobile application products and services are typically higher in the fourth quarter of the calendar year due to increased year-end advertising and marketing budgets. Conversely, we generally experience lower advertising revenues during the first quarter of the calendar year due to weaker advertising spend following the holidays. Thus, our operating results in one or more future quarters or years may fluctuate substantially or fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In such event, the trading price of our Class B common stock may fluctuate significantly or decrease significantly.", "PERMNO": 16049, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "ZDGE"}
