RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that materially and adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of the events described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock may decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe depend on suppliers to consistently supply us with opportunistic products at attractive pricing, and any failure to procure such products could result in material adverse effects on our business, product inventories, sales and profit margins.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to strategically source a sufficient volume and variety of opportunistic products at attractive pricing. While opportunistic buying, operating with appropriate inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are key elements of our business strategy, they subject us to risks related to the pricing, quantity, mix, quality and timing of inventory flowing to our stores. We do not have significant control over the supply, cost or availability of many of the products offered for sale in our stores. Shortages or disruptions in the availability of quality products that excite our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAll of our inventory is acquired through purchase orders and we generally do not have long-term contractual agreements with our suppliers that obligate them to provide us with products exclusively or at specified quantities or prices, or at all. As a result, any of our current suppliers may decide to sell products to our competitors and may not continue selling products to us. In order to retain our competitive advantage, we need to continue to develop and maintain relationships with qualified suppliers that can satisfy our standards for quality and our requirements for delivery of products in a timely and efficient manner at attractive prices. The need to develop new relationships will be particularly important as we seek to expand our operations and enhance our product offerings in the future.\nWhile we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of product to date, manufacturers and distributors of name-brand products have become increasingly consolidated. Further consolidation of manufacturers or distributors could reduce our supply options and detrimentally impact the terms under which we purchase products. If one or more of our existing significant suppliers were to be unable or unwilling to continue providing products to us on attractive terms, we may have difficulty obtaining alternative sources. We cannot assure you that we would be able to find replacement suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The loss of one or more of our existing significant suppliers or our inability to develop relationships with new suppliers could reduce our competitiveness, slow our plans for further expansion and cause our sales and operating results to be materially adversely affected.\nOur suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes or constraints, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, significant public health and safety events, supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to provide us with quality products. These risks may delay or preclude delivery of product to us on a timely basis or at all.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify trends and maintain a consistent level of opportunistic products which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumer preferences often change rapidly and without warning. We may not successfully address consumer trends or be able to acquire desirable products at discounts that excite our customers, which could add difficulty in attracting new customers and retaining existing customers and encouraging frequent visits. We generally make individual purchase decisions for products that become available, and these purchases may be for large quantities that we may not be able to sell on a timely or cost-effective basis. Some of our products are sourced from suppliers at significantly reduced prices for specific reasons, and we are not always able to purchase specific products on a recurring basis. To the extent that some of our suppliers are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory, the amount of over-stock and short-dated products available to us could also be materially reduced, making it difficult to deliver products to our customers at attractive prices. Maintaining adequate inventory of quality, name-brand products requires significant attention and monitoring of market trends, local markets and developments with suppliers and our distribution network, and it is not certain that we or the IOs will be effective in inventory management.\nWe base our purchases of inventory, in part, on our sales forecasts. If our sales forecasts overestimate customer demand, we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slow-moving inventory, leading to decreased profit margins. Conversely, if our sales forecasts underestimate customer demand, we may have insufficient inventory to meet demand, leading to lost sales, either of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur success depends on our ability and the ability of the IOs to maintain or increase comparable store sales, and if we are unable to achieve comparable store growth, our profitability and performance could be materially adversely impacted.\nThe IOs are responsible for store operations. Our success depends on increasing comparable store sales through our opportunistic purchasing strategy and the ability of the IOs to increase sales and profits. To increase sales and profits, and therefore comparable store sales growth, we and the IOs focus on delivering value and generating customer excitement by strengthening opportunistic purchasing, optimizing inventory management, maintaining strong store conditions and effectively marketing current products and new product offerings. We may not be able to maintain or improve the levels of comparable store sales that we have experienced in the past, and our comparable store sales growth is a significant driver of our profitability and overall business results. In addition, competition and pricing pressures from competitors may also materially adversely impact our operating margins. Our comparable store sales growth could be lower than our historical average or our future target for many reasons, including general economic conditions, operational performance, including by the IOs, price inflation or deflation, industry competition, new competitive entrants near our stores, price changes in response to competitive factors, the impact of new stores entering the comparable store base, cycling against any year or quarter of above-average sales results, possible supply shortages or other operational disruptions, the number and dollar amount of customer transactions in our stores, our ability to provide product or service offerings that generate new and repeat visits to our stores and the level of customer engagement that we and the IOs provide in our stores. In addition, we may not accurately model cannibalization for our new stores. Opening new stores in our established markets may result in inadvertent oversaturation, temporarily or permanently diverting customers and sales from our existing stores to new stores and reduce comparable store sales, thus adversely affecting our overall financial performance. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to be materially lower than in recent periods, which could harm our profitability and business.\nBecause we compete to a substantial degree on price, changes affecting the market prices of the products we sell, including due to inflation or deflation or worsening economic conditions, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nA critical differentiator of our business is our ability to offer value to our customers, including offering prices that are substantially below those offered by some of our competitors. We carefully monitor the market prices of our products in order to maintain our price advantage and reputation. If prices of goods increase and our suppliers seek price increases from us, we may not be able to mitigate such increases and would consider setting a higher price, which could deter customers. If our competitors substantially lower their prices, we may lose customers and mark down prices. Our profitability may be impacted by lower prices, which may impact gross margins. We may also experience reduced sales as a result of a decline in the number and average basket size of customer transactions.\nIn addition, the market price of the products we sell can be influenced by general economic conditions. For example, general deflation in the prices of the products we sell could cause us and the IOs to mark down prices and thereby reduce our gross profits and gross margins. Adverse general economic conditions could also increase costs to us, such as shipping rates, freight costs and store occupancy costs and further reduce our sales or increase our cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses. Our low-price model and competitive pressures may inhibit our ability to reflect these increased costs in the prices of our products, and therefore reduce our profitability and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot open, relocate or remodel stores on schedule, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, future growth and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy largely depends on our ability to identify and open future store locations and relocate or remodel existing store locations in new and existing markets. We opened 34 new stores in fiscal 2019. Our ability to open stores in a timely manner depends in part on the following factors: the ability to attract and develop potential IOs; the availability of attractive store locations and rent prices; the absence of entitlement processes or occupancy delays; the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms; our relationships with current and prospective landlords; the ability to secure and manage the inventory necessary for the launch and operation of new stores; general economic conditions; and the availability of capital funding for expansion. Any or all of these factors and conditions could materially adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nOur goal is to expand our store base by approximately 10% annually over the next several years. However, we cannot assure you that we will achieve this level of new store growth. We may not have the level of cash flow or financing necessary to support our growth strategy. Additionally, our proposed expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. These increased demands could cause us to operate our existing business less efficiently, which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our existing stores. If we experience a decline in performance, we may slow or discontinue store openings, or we may decide to close stores that are unable to operate in a profitable manner. If we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, including by opening new stores, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nDelays or failures in opening new stores or completing relocations or remodels could materially adversely affect our growth and/or profitability. Additionally, new stores might not always align with our expectations in terms of sales or capital expenditures and we may not achieve projected results.\nOur newly opened stores may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term and may not achieve sales and operating levels consistent with our more mature stores on a timely basis or at all.\nWe have actively pursued new store growth, including in new markets, and plan to continue doing so in the future. Our new store openings may not be successful or reach the sales and profitability levels of our existing stores. Some new stores may be located in areas with different competitive and market conditions as well as different customer discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. Some new stores and future new store opportunities may be located in new geographic areas where we have limited or no meaningful experience or brand recognition. We may experience a higher cost of entry in those markets as we build brand awareness and drive customers to incorporate us into their shopping habits. For example, in Southern California the IOs have experienced slower growth and profitability than our existing stores as they continue to build brand awareness in the market.\nNew store openings may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term due to the effect of store opening costs and lower sales and contribution to overall profitability during the initial period following opening. New stores, particularly those in new markets, build their sales volume, brand recognition and customer base over time and, as a result, generally have lower margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores. New stores may not achieve sustained sales and operating levels consistent with our more mature store base on a timely basis or at all. This lack of performance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations into new geographic markets. We may not manage our expansion effectively, and our failure to achieve or properly execute our expansion plans could limit our growth or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, some sales cannibalization of our existing stores to our new stores. As some of our existing customers switch to new, closer locations within markets, our financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nEconomic conditions and other economic factors may materially adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business by negatively impacting our customers\u2019 disposable income or discretionary spending, increasing our costs and expenses, affecting our ability to plan and execute our strategic initiatives, and materially adversely affecting our sales, results of operations and performance.\nGeneral conditions in the United States and global economy that are beyond our control may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. While we have not previously been materially adversely affected by periods of decreased consumer spending, any factor that could materially adversely affect the disposable income of our customers could decrease our customers\u2019 spending and number of trips to our stores, which could result in lower sales, increased markdowns on products, a reduction in profitability due to lower margins and may require increased selling and promotional expenses. These factors include but are not limited to unemployment, minimum wages, significant public health and safety events, inflation and deflation, trade wars and interest and tax rates.\nMany of the factors identified above also affect commodity rates, transportation costs, costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, the strength of the U.S. dollar, lease costs, measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in laws, regulations and policies and other economic factors, all of which may impact our cost of goods sold and our selling, general and administrative expenses, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors could also materially adversely affect our ability to plan and execute our strategic initiatives, invest in and open new stores, prevent current stores from closing, and may have other material adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control, all of which may materially adversely affect our sales, cash flow, results of operations and performance. We have limited or no ability to control many of these factors.\nFood retailers provide alternative options for consumers and compete aggressively to win those consumers; our failure to offer a compelling value proposition to consumers could limit our growth opportunities and materially adversely impact our financial performance.\nThe retail food industry includes mass and discount retailers, warehouse membership clubs, online retailers, conventional grocery stores and specialty stores. These businesses provide alternative options for the consumers whom we aim to serve. Our success relative to these retailers is driven by a combination of factors, primarily product selection and quality, price, location, customer engagement and store format. Our success depends on our ability to differentiate ourselves and provide value to our customers, and our failure to do so may negatively impact our sales. To the extent that other food retailers lower prices or run promotions, our ability to maintain profit margins and sales levels may be negatively impacted. We and the IOs may have to increase marketing expense to attract customers, and may have to mark down prices to be competitive and not lose market share. This limitation may materially adversely affect our margins and financial performance.\nCompetition for customers has intensified as other discount food retailers, such as Aldi, Lidl and WinCo have moved into, or increased their presence in, our geographic and product markets. We expect this competition to continue to increase. In addition, we experience high levels of competition when we enter new markets. Some of the other food retailers may have been in the region longer and may benefit from enhanced brand recognition in such regions. For example, we recently expanded in Southern California and, as of December 28, 2019, had 75 stores in that area. Our new stores in this market are competing against more established retailers. Some food retailers may have greater financial or marketing resources than the IOs do and may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products than the IOs. As competition in certain regions intensifies, or we move into new regions or other food retailers open stores in close proximity to our stores, our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales, decrease in market share, reduction in margin from competitive price changes or greater operating costs.\nWe may not be able to retain the loyalty of our customers, the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on repeat visits by our customer base to drive our consistent sales and sales growth. Competition for customers has also intensified from the use of mobile and web-based technology that facilitates online shopping and real-time product and price comparisons. We expect this competition to continue to increase. We do not maintain a loyalty program for customers, and our competitors may be able to offer their customers promotions or loyalty program incentives that could result in fewer shopping trips to or purchases from our stores. If we are unable to retain the loyalty of our customers, our sales could decrease and we may not be able to grow our store base as planned, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon our marketing, advertising and promotional efforts. If costs associated with these efforts increase, or if we are unable to implement them successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use marketing and promotional programs to attract customers into our stores and to encourage purchases. If we are unable to develop and implement effective marketing, advertising and promotional strategies, we may be unable to achieve and maintain brand awareness and repeat store visits. We may not be able to advertise cost effectively in new or smaller markets in which we have fewer stores, which could slow growth at such stores. Changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity or merchandising strategies by our competitors could cause us to have difficulties in retaining existing customers and attracting new customers. If the efficacy of our marketing or promotional activities declines or if such activities of our competitors are more effective than ours, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain our reputation and the value of our brand, including protection of our intellectual property, our sales and operating results may decline.\nWe believe our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the value of our brand. Brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. Even isolated incidents involving our company, the IOs and their employees, suppliers, agents or third-party service providers, or the products we sell can erode trust and confidence. This is particularly the case if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. The reputation of our company and our brand may be damaged in all, one or some of the markets in which we do business, by adverse events at the corporate level or by an IO acting outside of Grocery Outlet\u2019s brand standards. Similarly, challenges or reactions to action (or inaction) or perceived action (or inaction), by us on issues like social policies, merchandising, compliance related to social, product, labor and environmental standards or other sensitive topics, and any perceived lack of transparency about such matters, could harm our reputation, particularly as expectations of companies and of companies\u2019 corporate responsibility may continue to change.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms and online forums may increase the chance that an adverse event could negatively affect the reputation of our brand. The online dissemination of negative information about our brand, including inaccurate information, could harm our reputation, business, competitive advantage and goodwill. Damage to our reputation could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales, affect our supplier relationships, business development opportunities and IO retention, divert attention and resources from management, including by requiring responses to inquiries or additional regulatory scrutiny, and otherwise materially adversely affect our results. Our brand could be materially adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity.\nWe regard our intellectual property, including trademarks and service marks, as having significant value, and our brand is an important factor in the marketing of our stores. We monitor and protect against activities that might infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademarks and other intellectual property and rely on trademark and other laws of the United States, but we may not be able or willing to successfully enforce our trademarks or intellectual property rights against competitors or challenges by others. For example, we are aware of certain companies in jurisdictions where we do not currently operate using the term \u201cGROCERY OUTLET.\u201d Moreover, we have disclaimed the terms \u201cGROCERY OUTLET\u201d and \u201cMARKET\u201d with respect to our \u201cGROCERY OUTLET BARGAIN MARKET\u201d trademarks, among other disclaimed terms with respect to our registered trademarks and trademark applications. If a third party uses such disclaimed terms in its trademarks, we cannot object to such use. If we fail to protect our trademarks or other intellectual property rights, others may copy or use our trademarks or intellectual property without authorization, which may harm the value of our brand, reputation, competitive advantages and goodwill and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, or trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. Additionally, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other intellectual property. We are susceptible to others infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. Actions we have taken to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of our intellectual property by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the U.S. or other countries, including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights, could have an impact on our ability to enforce those rights.\nThere may in the future be opposition and cancellation proceedings from time to time with respect to some of our intellectual property rights. In some cases, litigation may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, and we may be subject to liability, required to enter into costly license agreements, if available at all, required to rebrand our products and/or prevented from selling some of our products if third parties successfully oppose or challenge our trademarks or successfully claim that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademarks, copyrights, patents or other intellectual property rights. Bringing or defending any such claim, regardless of merit, and whether successful or unsuccessful, could be expensive and time-consuming and have a negative effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny significant disruption to our distribution network, the operations of our distribution centers and our timely receipt of inventory could materially adversely impact our operating performance.\nWe rely on our distribution and transportation network, including by means of truck, ocean and rail to provide goods to our distribution centers and stores in a timely and cost-effective manner. We use three primary leased distribution centers that we operate and five primary distribution centers operated by third-parties. Deliveries to our stores occur from our distribution centers or directly from our suppliers. Any disruption, unanticipated or unusual expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively. For example, delivery delays or increases in transportation costs (including through increased fuel costs, increased carrier rates or driver wages as a result of driver shortages, a decrease in transportation capacity, or work stoppages or slowdowns) could significantly decrease our ability to generate sales and earn profits. In addition, events beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events or labor disagreements, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores. While we maintain business interruption insurance, in the event our distribution centers are shut down for any reason, such insurance may not be sufficient, and any related insurance proceeds may not be timely paid to us. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to renew the leases or third-party distribution and transportation contracts, as applicable, on our distribution centers on attractive terms or at all, which may increase our expenses and cause temporary disruptions in our distribution network.\nAs we expand, effectively managing our distribution network and distribution centers becomes more complex. Our new store locations receiving shipments may be further away from our distribution centers, which may increase transportation costs and may create transportation scheduling strains, or may require us to add additional facilities to the network.\nIf consumer trends move toward private label and away from name-brand products, our competitive position in the market may weaken and our sales may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business model has traditionally relied on the sale of name-brand products at meaningful discounts. Consumer acceptance of, and even preference for, private label products has been increasing, however, and a trend away from name-brand products could weaken our competitive position in the market. Private label products tend to be lower priced than name-brand products and, as a result, we may have more difficulty competing against private label products on the basis of price. While we may invest more in the future in developing our own private labels, there can be no assurance that the performance of any such private label products would be sufficient to offset the potential decreased sales of name-brand products. In addition, if we invest in expanding our private label products, we will need to make significant investments in developing effective quality control procedures. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will require significant capital to fund our expanding business. If we are unable to maintain sufficient levels of cash flow from our operations, we may not be able to execute or sustain our growth strategy or we may require additional financing, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all.\nTo support our expanding business and execute our growth strategy, we will need significant amounts of capital, including funds to pay our lease obligations, build out new stores and distribution centers, remodel our stores, purchase opportunistic inventory, pay employees and further invest in the business. Further, our plans to grow our store base may create cash flow pressure if new locations do not perform as projected.\nWe expect to primarily depend on cash flow from operations to fund our business and growth plans. We cannot assure you that cash generated by our operations will be sufficient to allow us to fund our growth plans. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may need to obtain additional funds through public or private financings, collaborative relationships or other arrangements. We cannot assure you that this additional funding, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, if at all. Any equity financing or debt financing that is convertible into equity that we may pursue could result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders. Tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity and volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit, higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us. Furthermore, any additional debt financing, if available, will increase our leverage and may involve restrictive covenants that could affect our ability to raise additional capital or operate our business. If such financing is not available to us, or is not available on satisfactory terms, our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations could be impeded and we may need to delay, limit or eliminate planned store openings or operations or other elements of our growth strategy. Such actions could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.\nWe currently lease substantially all of our store locations, primary distribution centers and administrative offices (including our headquarters in Emeryville, California), and a number of these leases expire or are up for renewal each year. Our operating leases typically have initial lease terms of ten years with renewal options for two or three successive five-year periods at our discretion.\nTypically, the largest portion of a store\u2019s operating expense that we bear is the cost associated with leasing the location. Our total lease payment obligations for all operating leases in existence as of December 28, 2019 is $98.3 million for fiscal year 2020 and $1.14 billion in aggregate for fiscal years 2021 through 2038. We are also generally responsible for property taxes, insurance and common area maintenance for our leased properties. We expect that many of the new stores we open will also be leased to us under operating leases, which will further increase our operating lease expenditures. If we are unable to make the required payments under our leases, the lenders or owners of the relevant stores, distribution centers or administrative offices may, among other things, repossess those assets, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations. In addition, our failure to make payments under our operating leases could trigger defaults under other leases or under our First Lien Credit Agreement (as defined elsewhere in this report), which could cause the counterparties under those agreements to accelerate the obligations due thereunder.\nThe operating leases for our store locations, distribution centers and administrative offices expire at various dates through 2038. When the lease term for our stores expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms. Any of these factors could cause us to close stores in desirable locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOver time, current store locations may not continue to be desirable because of changes in demographics within the surrounding area or a decline in shopping traffic. While we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions, we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so. If we decide to close stores, we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases, which generally include paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term. When we assign leases or sublease space to third parties, we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform.\nAny failure to maintain the security of information we hold relating to personal information or payment card data of our customers, employees and suppliers, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could subject us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures, and could materially disrupt our operations and harm our reputation and sales.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and the IOs collect, store, process, use and transmit confidential business information and certain personal information relating to customers, employees and suppliers. All customer payment data is encrypted, and we do not store such data in our systems. We rely in part on commercially available systems, software, hardware, services, tools and monitoring to provide security for collection, storage, processing and transmission of personal and/or confidential information. It is possible that cyber attackers might compromise our security measures and obtain the personal and/or confidential information of the customers, employees and suppliers that we hold or our business information. Cyber attacks are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion.\nMoreover, an employee, contractor or third party with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations may fail to monitor their or our systems effectively, may fail to maintain appropriate safeguards, may misuse the personal and/or confidential information to which they have access, may attempt to circumvent our security measures, may purposefully or inadvertently allow unauthorized access to our or their systems or to personal and/or confidential information or may otherwise disrupt our business operations. We and our customers could suffer harm if valuable business data or employee, customer and other proprietary information were corrupted, lost or accessed or misappropriated by third parties due to a security failure in our systems or those of our suppliers or service providers. It could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers, result in unwanted media attention and lost sales and expose us to risks of litigation and liability. In addition, as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become increasingly uncertain, rigorous and complex. As a result, we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information and we may not be able to comply with new regulations.\nIn addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection, information security and consumer protection. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020, establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours, and requires us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance related costs and expenses. The CCPA provides new and enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording consumers the right to opt out of certain sales of personal information and prohibiting covered businesses from discriminating against consumers (e.g., charging more for services) for exercising any of their CCPA rights. The CCPA imposes a severe statutory damages framework and private rights of action for CCPA violations and failure to implement reasonable security procedures and practices that results in a data breach. Any failure to comply with the laws and regulations surrounding the protection of personal information, privacy and data security could subject us to legal and reputational risks and costs, including significant fines for non-compliance, any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nBecause we and the IOs accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks, credit and debit cards, Electronic Benefit Transfer (\u201cEBT\u201d) cards and gift cards, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we or the IOs pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We and the IOs rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, EBT cards and gift cards, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us, experience a data security incident or fail to comply with applicable laws, rules and industry standards.\nWe are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change over time. For example, we and the IOs are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. In addition, if our internal systems are breached or compromised, we and the IOs may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and/or debit card payments from our customers, and our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not currently compete in the growing online retail marketplace and any online retail services or e-commerce activities that we may launch in the future may require substantial investment and may not be successful.\nWe do not currently provide online services or e-commerce. To the extent that we implement e-commerce selling operations, we would incur substantial expenses related to such activities, be exposed to additional cybersecurity risks and potentially be subject to additional data privacy regulations. Further, any development of an online retail marketplace is a complex undertaking, and there is no guarantee that any resources we apply to this effort will result in increased sales or operating performance. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might materially adversely affect sales in any e-commerce business that we establish in the future and could damage our reputation and brand. Additionally, certain of our competitors and a number of pure online retailers have established robust online operations. Increased competition from online grocery retailers and our lack of an online retail presence may reduce our customers\u2019 desire to purchase products from us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny material disruption to our information technology systems as a result of external factors or challenges or difficulties in maintaining or updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe rely on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business, including point of sale, inventory management, purchasing, financials, logistics, accounts payable and human resources information systems. We are dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operation of these systems and related back-up systems. Such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cybersecurity breaches, cyber attacks (including malicious codes, worms, phishing and denial of service attacks and ransomware), software upgrade failures or code defects, natural disasters and human error. Damage or interruption to, or defects of design related to, these systems or the integration of such systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace, and we may suffer interruptions or disruptions in our operations in the interim, may experience loss or corruption of critical data and may receive negative publicity, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Although we have taken steps designed to reduce the risk of these events occurring, there can be no guarantee that we or a third party on which we rely will not suffer one of these events.\nWe modify, update and replace our systems and infrastructure from time to time, including by adding new hardware, software and applications; maintaining, updating or replacing legacy programs; converting to global systems; integrating new service providers; and adding enhanced or new functionality, such as cloud computing technologies. In addition, we have a customized ERP system, components of which have been replaced and components of which we anticipate will be replaced this year and over the next several years. There is a risk of business disruption, liability and reputational damage associated with these actions, including from not accurately capturing and maintaining data, efficiently testing and implementing changes, realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the actions and diversion of internal teams\u2019 attention as the changes are implemented.\nFurther, potential issues associated with implementing technology initiatives and the time and resources required in seeking to optimize the benefits of new elements of our systems and its infrastructure could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends upon our information systems, including our ability to operate, maintain and develop them effectively. A failure of those systems could disrupt our business, subject us to liability, damage our reputation, or otherwise impact our financial results.\nReal or perceived concerns that products we and the IOs sell could cause unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death could expose us to lawsuits and harm our reputation, which could result in unexpected costs.\nIf our products do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers\u2019 expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. Issues regarding the quality or safety of any food items sold by us, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our sales and operating results.\nThere is increasing governmental scrutiny and regulation of and public awareness regarding food safety. Unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death caused by products we and the IOs sell or involving suppliers that supply us with products could result in the discontinuance of sales of these products or our relationship with such suppliers or prevent us from achieving market acceptance of the affected products. We cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause side effects, illness, injury or death in the future, as product deficiencies might not be identified before we sell such products to our customers.\nWe also may be subject to claims, lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, negative publicity could materially adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image, and these effects could persist over the long term. Any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources. Further, we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment, in which case our creditors could levy against our assets.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations generally applicable to retailers. Compliance with, failure to comply with, or changes to such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nOur business is subject to numerous and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations. We routinely incur significant costs in complying with these regulations. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we and the IOs operate and the related cost of compliance are increasing due to additional legal and regulatory requirements, our expanding operation and increased enforcement efforts. Further, uncertainties exist regarding the future application of certain of these legal requirements to our business. New or existing laws, regulations and policies, liabilities arising thereunder and the related interpretations and enforcement practices, particularly those dealing with environmental protection and compliance, taxation, zoning and land use, workplace safety, public health, community right-to-know, product safety or labeling, food safety, alcohol and beverage sales, vitamin and supplements, information security and privacy and labor and employment, among others, or changes in existing laws, regulations, policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices, particularly those governing the sale of products, may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and/or could materially increase our cost of doing business. For example, we or the IOs have had to comply with recent new laws in many of the states or counties in which we operate regarding recycling, waste, minimum wages, sick time, vacation, plastic bag and straw bans and sugar taxes. In addition, we and the IOs are subject to environmental laws pursuant to which we and the IOs could be strictly and jointly and severally liable for any contamination at our current or former locations, or at third-party waste disposal sites, regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for such contamination.\nApproximately 8% of sales are in the form of EBT payments and a substantial portion of these payments may be related to benefits associated with the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (\u201cSNAP\u201d). Accordingly, changes in EBT regulations by the U.S. Department of Agriculture or in SNAP benefits by Congress could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe cannot assure you that we or the IOs will comply promptly and fully with all laws, regulations, policies and the related interpretations that apply to our stores. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall, can result in the imposition of penalties (including loss of licenses, eligibility to accept certain government benefits such as SNAP or significant fines or monetary penalties), civil or criminal liability, damages, class action litigation or other litigation, in addition to reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal proceedings from customers, suppliers, employees, governments or competitors could materially impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to allegations, and may be party to legal claims and regulatory proceedings, relating to our business operations. Such allegations, claims and proceedings may be brought by third parties, including our customers, suppliers, employees, governmental or regulatory bodies or competitors, and may include class actions. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. While the IOs and suppliers will typically indemnify us for certain adverse outcomes, we may still bear significant expenses related to such proceedings. While we maintain insurance, insurance coverage may not be adequate, and the cost to defend against future litigation may be significant.\nFrom time to time, our employees may bring lawsuits against us regarding discrimination, creating a hostile workplace, sexual harassment and other employment issues. The IOs may also experience similar lawsuits from their own employees. In recent years, companies have experienced an increase in the number of discrimination and harassment and wage and hour claims generally. Coupled with the expansion of social media platforms that allow individuals with access to a broad audience, these claims have had a significant negative impact on some businesses. Some companies that have faced employment- or harassment-related lawsuits have had to terminate management or other key personnel, and have suffered reputational harm. If we were to face any employment-related or other claims, our reputation and business could be negatively affected. In addition, such lawsuits brought against the IOs, even if we are not named or are ultimately not found liable, could adversely impact our reputation and business.\nOur current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance, particularly if we incur losses not covered by our insurance or if claims differ from our estimates.\nOur insurance coverage reflects deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are reasonable based on our operations. However, there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of war, employee and certain other crime, certain wage and hour and other employment-related claims, including class actions, actions based on certain consumer protection laws, certain cyber events and some natural and other disasters or similar events. If we incur these losses and they are material, our business could suffer. Certain material events, such as earthquakes or the recent California wildfires, may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases. Our retail stores located in California, and the inventory in those stores, are not currently insured against losses due to earthquakes. We have experienced significant challenges in renewing the insurance policies for our stores as insurers have incurred substantial losses related to property claims from fires, floods and other catastrophic events and are significantly increasing policy premiums, increasing their requirements around building engineering standards or cutting back capacity for coverage offerings to layered/quota share. To offset negative insurance market trends, we may elect to increase our self-insurance coverage, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage.\nIn addition, we self-insure, or insure through captive insurance companies, a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses, including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. IOs are required to maintain certain types and amounts of insurance coverage. If they fail to secure adequate insurance, injured parties may bring actions against us.\nIf we or the IOs are unable to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees, our financial performance may be negatively affected.\nOur future growth, performance and positive customer experience depends on our and the IOs\u2019 ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified employees who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and customers. We and the IOs face intense competition for employees. If we and the IOs are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified employees, our operations, customer service levels and support functions could suffer. There is no assurance that we and the IOs will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees to operate our business.\nLabor relation difficulties could materially adversely affect our business.\nEmployees at two Company-operated stores are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. Our employees and those of the IOs have the right at any time to form or affiliate with a union. As we continue to grow, enter different regions and operate distribution centers, unions may attempt to organize the employees of our different IOs or our distribution centers within certain regions. We cannot predict the adverse effects that any future organizational activities will have on our business, financial condition and operating results. If we or the IOs were to become subject to work stoppages, we could experience disruption in our operations and increases in our labor costs, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel. If we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that our success depends to a significant extent on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. The unexpected loss of services of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause our stock price to decline. We do not maintain key person insurance on any of our key personnel. There can be no assurance that our executive succession planning, retention or hiring efforts will be successful. Competition for skilled and experienced management in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters may materially impact reporting of our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as accounting for long-lived asset impairment, goodwill, variable interest entities and share-based compensation, are complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change or add significant volatility to our reported or expected financial performance. For example, our adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases had a material impact on our financial statements. For more information see \u201cRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\u201d and \u201cRecently Issued Accounting Standards\u201d in NOTE 1-Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and any impairment of these assets could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe monitor the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as our store investments, and evaluate them annually to determine if impairment has occurred. Accounting rules require us to review the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Such indicators are based on market conditions and the operational performance of our business. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the intangible assets or goodwill and the fair value of the intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill, respectively, in the period the determination is made. The testing of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill for impairment requires us to make estimates that are subject to significant assumptions about our future sales, profitability, cash flow, fair value of assets and liabilities, weighted average cost of capital, as well as other assumptions. Changes in these estimates, or changes in actual performance compared with these estimates, may affect the fair value of intangible assets or goodwill, which may result in an impairment charge.\nWe may take impairment charges in the future based on such assumptions. We cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets. If a significant amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA significant decline in our operating profit and taxable income may impair our ability to realize the value of our deferred tax assets.\nWe are required by accounting rules to periodically assess our deferred tax assets for a valuation allowance, if necessary. In performing these assessments, we use our historical financial performance to determine whether we have potential valuation allowance concerns and as evidence to support our assumptions about future financial performance. A significant decline in our financial performance could negatively affect the results of our assessments of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets could be material and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nTax matters could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to federal and state income and other taxes in the United States. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted federal and state tax rates. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in tax audits, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) significantly revised the current federal income tax code with significant changes to corporate taxation, including reducing the corporate tax rate, limiting certain tax deductions and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. While the Tax Act reduced the federal income tax rate for corporations, it created certain limits and potentially changes the timing of certain deductions which could reduce our cash flow in certain periods. Many aspects of the new law are uncertain and are subject to further guidance from U.S. regulators and significant judgments will need to be made in the interpretation of various provisions. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law, which could also impact our tax obligations.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we had a tax-effected deferred tax asset of $268.2 million. Our ability to use our deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate future earnings within the operating loss carry-forward periods, which are generally 20 years. Some or all of our deferred tax asset could expire unused if we are unable to generate taxable income in the future sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset, or we enter into transactions that limit our right to use it. If a material portion of our deferred tax asset expires unused, it could have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock. Our ability to realize the deferred tax asset is periodically reviewed and any necessary valuation allowance is recorded or adjusted accordingly.\nIn addition, certain states and local jurisdictions have recently approved or proposed gross receipt tax measures. For example, effective January 1, 2020, Oregon enacted a gross receipts tax which establishes a new 0.57% gross receipts tax. Should these gross receipt tax measures succeed in other jurisdictions in which we operate, we anticipate an increase in our operating expenses.\nNatural disasters and unusual weather conditions (whether or not caused by climate change), power outages, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, global political events and other serious catastrophic events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nNatural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, unusual weather conditions, power outages, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, or similar disruptions could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. For example, our store in Paradise, California was lost due to the fires in that area in November 2018. Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns, which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and materially adversely affect our short-term results of operations. To the extent these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers, a significant number of stores, or our administrative offices or impact one or more of our key suppliers, our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales. In addition, these events could result in increases in fuel (or other energy) prices or a fuel shortage, delays in opening new stores, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some domestic and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delay or increased transportation costs in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores, the inability of customers to reach or have transportation to our stores directly affected by such events, the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption of our utility services or to our information systems. These events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage.\nMajor health epidemics, such as the outbreak caused by a coronavirus (COVID-19), and other outbreaks could disrupt and adversely affect our operations, financial condition and business.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, major health epidemics related to viruses or other pathogens. For example, there was an outbreak of COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, in China in December 2019, which by March 2020 had spread to the United States and other countries and declared a global pandemic. As a result, many states, including California, Washington and Oregon, where we have a significant number of stores, have declared a state of emergency, closed schools and non-essential businesses and enacted limitations on the number of people allowed to gather at one time in the same space. We expect that our IOs may face staffing challenges so long as school closures and COVID-19-related concerns exist. In addition, certain inventory items such as water, beans and bread as well as key cleaning supplies and protective equipment have been, and may continue to be, in short supply. Supply for inventory, including opportunistic inventory, may be negatively impacted as overall demand for inventory has increased. These factors could impact the ability of stores to operate normal hours of operation or have sufficient inventory at all times which may disrupt our business and negatively impact our financial results. Our planned construction and opening of new stores may be negatively impacted due to state or county requirements that residents leave their homes only for essential business and the closure of government offices in certain areas which could negatively impact our financial results. We have transitioned a significant subset of our employee population to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, which may exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks. In the event that an employee, IO, or IO employee tests positive for COVID-19, we may have to temporarily close a store, office or distribution center for cleaning and/or quarantine one or more employees which could negatively impact our financial results. The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact to us of COVID-19. We are continuing to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and related risks. The magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows is uncertain as this continues to evolve globally.\nThese epidemics, or the perception that such epidemics may occur, may cause people to avoid gathering in public places, which may adversely affect our customer traffic, our ability and that of our IOs to adequately staff our stores and operations, and our ability to transport product on a timely basis. Further, outbreaks of pathogens, such as COVID-19, may also impact our ability to access and ship product from impacted locations. To the extent that a pathogen is food-borne, or perceived to be food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our customers to eat less of such product. Additionally, a prolonged widespread epidemic, or the perception that such an epidemic may occur, could adversely impact global economies and financial markets resulting in an economic downturn that may impact demand for our products. For example, during March 2020, the United States saw a significant increase in unemployment claims and other indications of a significant economic slowdown believed to be related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such impacts could adversely affect our operations, profitability, cash flows and financial results.\nThe current geographic concentration of our stores creates an exposure to local or regional downturns, natural or man-made disasters or other catastrophic occurrences.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we operated 197 stores and distributed product from four distribution centers in California, making California our largest market, representing 57% of our total stores. As a result, our business is currently more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and we are vulnerable to economic downturns in those regions. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability. These factors include, among other things, changes in demographics, population and employee bases, wage increases, changes in economic conditions, severe weather conditions and climate change, property tax increases and other catastrophic occurrences, such as wildfires and flooding. Such conditions may result in reduced customer traffic and spending in our stores, physical damage to our stores, loss of inventory, closure of one or more of our stores, inadequate workforce in our markets, temporary disruption in the supply of products, delays in the delivery of goods to our stores, increased expenses and a reduction in the availability of products in our stores. Any of these factors may disrupt our business and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations, which could negatively impact our financial performance and cause our results of operations or financial condition to suffer.\nAs a newly public company, we have incurred and will incur additional legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We have incurred and will incur costs associated with the rules of Nasdaq, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and related rules implemented by the SEC. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for director and officer liability insurance and reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing and may continue to increase. The Exchange Act requires us to file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition within specified time periods and to prepare a proxy statement with respect to our annual meeting of stockholders. Our management and other personnel will need to devote substantial amounts of time to ensure that we comply with all of the reporting requirements, limiting time spent focused on revenue-producing activities. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Nasdaq requires that we comply with various corporate governance requirements. These rules and regulations, and applicable case law, may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. These laws and regulations can also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. For example, the cost of director and officer liability insurance for California-based companies has recently increased significantly. These laws and regulations can also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory actions and potentially civil litigation.\nOur management has limited experience managing a public company, and our current resources may not be sufficient to fulfill our public company obligations.\nFollowing the completion of our initial public offering on June 24, 2019, we became subject to various regulatory requirements, including those of the SEC and Nasdaq. These requirements include record keeping, financial reporting and corporate governance rules and regulations. Our management team has limited experience in managing a public company. Our internal infrastructure may not be adequate to support our increased reporting obligations, and we may be unable to hire, train or retain necessary staff and may initially be reliant on engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome our lack of experience. Our business could be adversely affected if our internal infrastructure is inadequate, we are unable to engage outside consultants, or are otherwise unable to fulfill our public company obligations.\nChanges in accounting rules or interpretations thereof, changes to underlying legal agreements as well as other factors applicable to our analysis of the IO entities as variable interest entities could significantly impact our ability to issue our financial statements on a timely basis.\nIn accordance with the variable interest entities sub-section of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidation, we assess during each of our reporting periods whether we are considered the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) and therefore are required to consolidate the VIE in our financial statements. We have concluded that the IO entities represent VIEs. However, we have concluded we are not such VIE\u2019s primary beneficiary and, accordingly, we do not consolidate the IO entities\u2019 financial information. Changes in accounting rules or interpretations thereof, changes to the underlying Operator Agreements (as defined elsewhere in this report) as well as other factors that may impact the economic performance of the IO entities which may be relevant to our analysis of whether to consolidate the IO entities as VIEs could significantly impact our ability to issue our financial statements on a timely basis if, as a result, we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the IO entities and should consolidate such entities. For example, collecting the requisite accounting data from certain of our IO entities in order to consolidate their financial information would involve substantial time, effort and cost. For more information see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our IO Model\nIf the IOs are not successful in managing their business, our financial results and brand image could be negatively affected.\nThe financial health of the IOs is critical to their and our success. The IOs are business entities owned by entrepreneurs who generally live in the same community as the store that they operate as our independent contractor. IOs are responsible for operating their store consistent with our brand standards, hiring and supervising store-level employees, merchandising and selling products and managing and paying the expenses associated with their business. Although we select IOs through a rigorous vetting and training process, and continue to help IOs develop their business skills after they enter into an Operator Agreement with us, it is difficult to predict in advance whether a particular IO will be successful. If an IO is unable to successfully establish, manage and operate the store, their store\u2019s performance and quality of service could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any poor performance could negatively affect our financial results and our brand reputation.\nFailure of the IOs to repay notes outstanding to us may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe extend financing to IOs for their initial startup costs in the form of notes payable to us that bear interest at a rate of 9.95%. We lower the interest rate and delay repayment obligations on the notes outstanding for certain of the IOs participating in our Temporary Commission Adjustment Program (\u201cTCAP\u201d). The TCAP allows us to provide a greater commission to participating IOs who are struggling to meet their working capital needs for various reasons, such as entry into a new market or new competition. There can be no assurance that any IO, particularly those participating in TCAP, will achieve long-term store volumes or profitability that will allow them to repay any amounts due nor is there any assurance that any IO will be able to repay amounts due through other means.\nThe outstanding aggregate balance of notes receivable from IOs has increased over time as we have accelerated new store growth and initial IO capital and working capital requirements have increased. This balance may continue to increase as we open new stores. There were $32.0 million and $23.5 million of notes to IOs outstanding as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, and $9.8 million and $8.5 million reserved as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified IOs, our financial performance may be negatively affected.\nOur future growth and performance depend on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified IOs who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to represent our brand effectively. A material decrease in profitability of the IOs may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified IOs. While we use a variety of methods to attract and develop the IOs, including through our Aspiring Operators in Training (\u201cAOT\u201d) program, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified AOTs and other candidates to open successful new locations in order to meet our growth targets. Our ability to maintain our current performance and achieve future growth additionally depends on the IOs\u2019 ability to meet their labor needs while controlling wage and labor-related costs.\nIf the IOs are unable to avoid excess inventory shrink, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe IOs order merchandise solely from us, which we, in turn, deliver to IOs on a consignment basis. As a result, we retain ownership of all merchandise until the point in time that merchandise is sold to a customer. The IOs, however, are responsible for inventory management at their stores. Any spoiled, damaged or stolen merchandise, markdowns or price changes impact gross margin and, therefore, IO commission. We generally split these losses equally with IOs, however, excessive levels of shrink are deducted from commissions paid to IOs. Excessive shrink generally indicates poor inventory management and the IO\u2019s failure to use due care to secure their store against theft. If IOs were to not effectively control or manage inventory in their stores, they could experience higher rates of inventory shrink which could have a material adverse effect on their financial health, which in turn, may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur Operator Agreements may be terminated, and any loss or changeover of an IO may cause material business disruptions.\nEach Operator Agreement is subject to termination by either party without cause upon 75 days\u2019 notice. We may also terminate immediately \u201cfor cause.\u201d The \u201cfor cause\u201d termination triggers include, among other things, a failure to meet our brand standards, misuse of our trademarks and actions that in our reasonable business judgment threaten to harm our business reputation.\nIf we or an IO terminates the Operator Agreement then we must approve a new IO for that store. Any IO changeover consumes substantial time and resources. Often, a changeover will involve more than one transition, as an IO may move from an existing store, thereby creating an opening at the IO\u2019s previous store. A failure to transition a store successfully to another IO can negatively impact the customer experience or compromise our brand standards. Termination of an Operator Agreement could therefore result in the reduction of our sales and operating cash flow, and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal proceedings initiated against the IOs could materially impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe and the IOs are subject to a variety of litigation risks, including, but not limited to, individual personal injury, product liability, intellectual property, employment-related actions, litigation with or involving our relationship with IOs and property disputes and other legal actions in the ordinary course of our respective businesses. If the IOs are unable to provide an adequate remedy in a legal action, the plaintiffs may attempt to hold us liable. We maintain that under current applicable laws and regulations we are not joint employers with the IOs, and should not be held liable for their actions. However, these types of claims may increase costs and affect the scope and terms of insurance or indemnifications we and the IOs may have.\nOur Operator Agreements require each IO to maintain certain insurance types and levels. Losses arising from certain extraordinary hazards, employment matters or other matters, however, may not be covered, and insurance may not be available (or may be available only at prohibitively expensive rates) with respect to many other risks, or IOs may fail to procure the required insurance. Moreover, any loss incurred could exceed policy limits and policy payments made to IOs may not be made on a timely basis.\nAny legal actions against the IOs may negatively affect the reputation of our brand, which could result in a reduction of our sales and operating cash flow, which could be material and which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the past, certain business models that use independent contractors to sell directly to customers have been subject to challenge under various laws, including laws relating to franchising, misclassification and joint employment. If our business model is determined to be a franchise, if IOs are found not to be independent contractors, but our employees, or if we are found to be a joint employer of an IO\u2019s employees, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe IOs are independent contractors. Independent contractors and the companies that engage their services have come under increased legal and regulatory scrutiny in recent years as courts have adopted new standards for these classifications and federal legislators continue to introduce legislation concerning the classification of independent contractors as employees, including legislation that proposes to increase the tax and labor penalties against employers who intentionally or unintentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors and are found to have violated employees\u2019 overtime or wage requirements. Federal and state tax and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. For example, the California state legislature recently enacted AB-5, which became effective in California on January 1, 2020. AB-5 codifies a new test for determining worker classification that is much narrower than the traditional standard in defining the scope of who is classified as an independent contractor. Given AB-5\u2019s recent enactment, there has been limited guidance to date regarding interpretation or enforcement, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty regarding its application. In addition, AB-5 has been the subject of widespread national discussion and it is possible that other jurisdictions may enact similar laws. There is a risk that a governmental agency or court could disagree with our assessment that IOs are independent contractors or that other laws and regulations could change. If any IOs were determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, environmental and tort laws, which could potentially include prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.\nEven if IOs are properly classified as independent contractors, there is a risk that a governmental agency or court might disagree with our assessment that each IO is the sole employer of its workers and seek to hold us jointly and separately responsible as a co-employer of an IO\u2019s workers. In this case, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, which could potentially include prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings since joint employers are each separately responsible for their co-employees\u2019 benefits. A misclassification ruling would mean that both IOs and IOs\u2019 employees are our employees, it would also mean that an IOs\u2019 employees are also our employees.\nWe continue to observe and monitor our compliance with current applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot predict whether laws and regulations adopted in the future, or standards adopted by the courts, regarding the classification of independent contractors will materially adversely affect our business or operations. Further, if we were to become subject to franchise laws or regulations, it would require us to provide additional disclosures, register with state franchise agencies, impact our ability to terminate our Operator Agreements and may increase the expense of, or adversely impact our recruitment of new IOs.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain positive relationships with the IOs and any failure to maintain our relationships on positive terms could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe IOs develop and operate their stores under terms set forth in our Operator Agreements. These agreements give rise to relationships that involve a complex set of mutual obligations and depends on mutual cooperation and trust. We have a standard Operator Agreement that we use with the IOs, which contributes to uniformity of brand standards. We generally have positive relationships with the IOs, based in part on our common understanding of our mutual rights and obligations under the Operator Agreement. However, we and the IOs may not always maintain a positive relationship or always interpret the Operator Agreement in the same way. Our failure to maintain positive relationships with the IOs could individually or in the aggregate cause us to change or limit our business practices, which may make our business model less attractive to the IOs or stockholders or more costly to operate. Active and/or potential disputes with IOs could damage our brand image and reputation.\nThe success of our business depends in large part on our ability to maintain IOs in profitable stores. If we fail to maintain our IO relationships on acceptable terms, or if one or more of the more profitable IOs were to terminate their Operator Agreements, become insolvent or otherwise fail to comply with brand standards, our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe IOs could take actions that could harm our business.\nThe IOs are contractually obligated to operate their stores in accordance with the brand standards set forth in the Operator Agreements. However, IOs are independent contractors whom we do not control. The IOs operate and oversee the daily operations of their stores and have sole control over all of their employees and other workforce decisions. As a result, IOs make decisions independent of us that bear directly on the ultimate success and performance of their store. Nevertheless, the nature of the brand license creates a symbiotic relationship between our outcome and each IO. Indeed, because we and each of the IOs associate our separate businesses with the Grocery Outlet name and brand reputation, the failure of any IO to comply with our brand standards could potentially have repercussions that extend beyond that IO\u2019s own market area and materially adversely affect not only our business, but the business of other IOs and the general brand image and reputation of the Grocery Outlet name. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. If any particular IO operates a store in a manner inconsistent with our brand standards, we cannot assure you that we will be able to terminate the Operator Agreement of that IO without disruptions to the operations and sales of that IO\u2019s store or other stores.\nRisks Associated with Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business, react to changes in the economy or industry or pay our debts and meet our obligations under our debt and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we had a significant amount of indebtedness comprised of total borrowings under our First Lien Credit Agreement of $460.2 million. In June 2019, we used substantially all of the proceeds from our initial public offering to repay a portion of our indebtedness and we made an additional principal repayment of indebtedness in October 2019. We have liquidity through a largely undrawn $100.0 million revolving credit facility under our First Lien Credit Agreement, under which we had $96.4 million of availability after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d In addition, subject to restrictions in our First Lien Credit Agreement, we may incur additional debt.\nOur substantial debt could have important consequences to you, including the following:\n\u2022it may be difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including debt service requirements under our outstanding debt, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022a substantial portion of cash flow from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, acquisitions and other purposes;\n\u2022we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry is more limited;\n\u2022our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as compared to our competitors, may be compromised due to our high level of debt; and\n\u2022our ability to borrow additional funds or to refinance debt may be limited.\nFurthermore, all of our debt under our First Lien Credit Agreement bears interest at variable rates. If these rates were to increase significantly, whether because of an increase in market interest rates or a decrease in our creditworthiness, our ability to borrow additional funds may be reduced and the risks related to our substantial debt would intensify.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on numerous factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to service our debt obligations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. To some extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations, delay capital expenditures or raise additional debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nRestrictive covenants in our First Lien Credit Agreement may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies, and failure to comply with any of these restrictions could result in acceleration of our debt.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our First Lien Credit Agreement may materially adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. Such restrictions and covenants limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our common stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022sell certain assets;\n\u2022create liens on certain assets to secure debt;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022make certain payments in respect of certain junior debt obligations;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our First Lien Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our First Lien Credit Agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our First Lien Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our First Lien Credit Agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure our First Lien Credit Agreement. Our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with the financial maintenance covenant in our First Lien Credit Agreement, or any other indebtedness and we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts outstanding under our First Lien Credit Agreement. In addition, in the event of an acceleration of our debt upon a default, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments.\nFurthermore, the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could have further additional restrictive covenants. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future, and in the event that we are not able to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders or amend the covenants.\nDespite current debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although our First Lien Credit Agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, we may successfully obtain waivers of these restrictions. If we incur additional debt above the levels currently in effect, the risks associated with our leverage, including those described above, would increase. Our First Lien Credit Agreement includes a $100.0 million revolving credit facility under which we had $96.4 million of availability as of December 28, 2019 after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and may continue to fluctuate substantially due to a number of factors such as those listed in \u201c-Risks Related to Our Business\u201d and the following:\n\u2022results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u2022changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022declines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets;\n\u2022changes in business or regulatory conditions;\n\u2022additions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022future sales of our common stock or other securities by us or our existing stockholders, or the perception of such future sales;\n\u2022expiration of market standoff or lock-up agreements;\n\u2022investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022the public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022announcements relating to litigation;\n\u2022guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events.\nThese broad market and industry fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock are low.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods, our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could materially adversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past, and they may do so in the future. Therefore, results of any one fiscal quarter are not a reliable indication of results to be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for any year. If we fail to increase our results over prior periods, to achieve our projected results or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may decline, and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance. Results may be affected by various factors, including those described in these risk factors. We maintain a forecasting process that seeks to plan sales and align expenses. If we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results, or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are a holding company with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations.\nWe are a holding company with no material direct operations. Our principal assets are the shares of common stock of Globe Intermediate Corp. that we hold. Globe Intermediate Corp. is the indirect parent of Grocery Outlet Inc. which, together with its subsidiaries, owns substantially all of our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and may be prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations.\nWe currently do not intend to declare dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, as a result, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe currently do not expect to declare any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we anticipate that all of our earnings in the foreseeable future will be used to provide working capital, to support our operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. Any determination to declare or pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws and dependent upon a number of factors, including our earnings, capital requirements and overall financial conditions. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is currently limited by the covenants of our First Lien Credit Agreement and may be further restricted by the terms of any future debt or preferred securities. Accordingly, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our company may be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit. The market price for our common stock may never exceed, and may fall below, the price that you pay for such common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business or industry. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or industry, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nHolders of an aggregate of 34,532,952 shares of our outstanding common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nAs restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities.\nIn addition, the shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our Globe Holding Corp. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d) and our Grocery Outlet Holding Corp. 2019 Incentive Plan (the \u201c2019 Plan\u201d) will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to provisions relating to various vesting agreements and Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as applicable. A total of 14,231,355 shares of common stock have been reserved for future issuance under our 2014 Plan and our 2019 Plan.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you.\nProvisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider to be in its best interest, including attempts that might result in a premium over the market price of our common stock. As of March 20, 2020, the H&F Investor owned approximately 30% of the voting power of our outstanding stock.\nThese provisions provide for, among other things:\n\u2022the division of our board of directors into three classes, as nearly equal in size as possible, which directors in each class serving three-year terms and with terms of the directors of only one class expiring in any given year;\n\u2022that at any time when the H&F Investor and certain of its affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 40% in voting power of the stock of our company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, directors may only be removed for cause, and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could have the effect of impeding the success of an attempt to acquire us or otherwise effect a change of control;\n\u2022advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022the right of the H&F Investor and certain of its affiliates to nominate a number of members of our board of directors proportionate to their collective ownership of our common stock and the obligation of certain of our other pre-initial public offering stockholders to support such nominees;\n\u2022the right of certain other pre-initial public offering investors to nominate one member of our board of directors and the obligation of the H&F Investor and certain of our other pre-initial public offering stockholders to support such nominee;\n\u2022certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022that certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may be amended only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, if the H&F Investor and certain of its affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 40% in voting power of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.\nThese provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nThe H&F Investor holds a significant percentage of our outstanding stock and its interests may be different than the interests of other holders of our securities.\nAs of March 20, 2020, the H&F Investor owned approximately 30% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the H&F Investor is able to control or influence actions to be taken by us, including future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, amendments to our organizational documents and the approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets, distributions of our assets, the incurrence of indebtedness and any incurrence of liens on our assets. As a result, certain governance provisions in our organizational documents will be affected.\nThe interests of the H&F Investor may be materially different than the interests of our other stakeholders. In addition, the H&F Investor may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. For example, the H&F Investor may cause us to take actions or pursue strategies that could impact our ability to make payments under our First Lien Credit Agreement or that cause a change of control. In addition, to the extent permitted by our First Lien Credit Agreement, the H&F Investor may cause us to pay dividends rather than make capital expenditures or repay debt. The H&F Investor is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of the H&F Investor, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. The H&F Investor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nAs long as the H&F Investor continues to own a significant amount of our outstanding common stock, even if such amount is less than 30%, it will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions and, so long as the H&F Investor continues to own shares of our outstanding common stock, nominate individuals to our board of directors pursuant to the stockholders agreement we are parties to. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.\nFailure to comply with requirements to design, implement and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a privately-held company, we were not required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in a manner that meets the standards of publicly traded companies required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d). As a public company, we have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. If we are unable to establish or maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations on a timely basis, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and harm our results of operations. In addition, we are required, pursuant to Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report for the year ended January 2, 2021. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. Testing and maintaining internal controls may divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to our business. Our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to issue an attestation report on effectiveness of our internal controls in our annual report for the year ended January 2, 2021.\nIn connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the remediation of any deficiencies identified by our independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the issuance of their attestation report.\nOur testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. A material weakness in internal control could result in our failure to detect a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly consolidated financial statements or disclosures. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the sole and exclusive forums for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide, subject to limited exceptions, that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of our company to the Company or our stockholders, (iii) action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or other employee of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine. These provisions shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Unless we consent in writing to the selections of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws.\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a different judicial forum, including one that it may find favorable or convenient for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or other employees which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions that will be contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently determined that a provision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. However, this decision may be reviewed and ultimately overturned by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue and designate shares of our preferred stock in additional series without stockholder approval.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue 50,000,000 shares of our preferred stock, subject to limitations prescribed by applicable law, rules and regulations and the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as shares of preferred stock in series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The powers, preferences and rights of these additional series of preferred stock may be senior to or on parity with our common stock, which may reduce its value.", "PERMNO": 18735, "SIC": 5411, "TIC": "GO"}
