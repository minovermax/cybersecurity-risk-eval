{"cik": "1349929", "company": "CANCER GENETICS, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk including the risk of a loss of your entire investment. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information contained in this report and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The risks set forth below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties may exist that could also adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. If any of the following risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and/or operations could suffer. In such event, the value of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a substantial portion of the money that you pay for our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have a history of net losses; we expect to incur net losses in the future, and we may never achieve sustained profitability.\nWe have historically incurred substantial net losses. We incurred losses of $20.4 million and $20.8 million for fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. From our inception in April 1999 through December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $157.7 million. We expect losses to continue principally as a result of difficulties in being able to collect cash from certain third-party payors or obtain reimbursement at adequate prices, or at all, for tests provided to our Clinical Services customers, ongoing research and development expenses and sales and marketing costs. These losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our research, development and commercialization efforts, we are unable to predict when we will become profitable, and we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our inability to achieve and then maintain profitability would negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur recurring losses from operations have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAt December 31, 2018, our cash position and history of losses required management to assess our ability to continue operating as a going concern, according to Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (\u201cASU 2014-15\u201d). We did not have sufficient cash at December 31, 2018 to fund normal operations for the next twelve months. In addition, we have been in violation of certain financial covenants under our debt agreements. While our lenders have conditionally agreed to forbear from exercising their rights and remedies resulting from existing and potential defaults, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to comply with the forbearance conditions and other debt agreement covenants, raise additional equity or debt capital and/or spin-off non-core assets to raise additional cash. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have hired Raymond James & Associates, Inc. as our financial advisor to assist with evaluating strategic alternatives. Such alternatives could include raising more capital, the acquisition of another company and/or complementary assets, the sale of the Company or another type of strategic partnership. We can provide no assurances that our current actions will be successful or that additional sources of financing with be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe are in default of financial covenants in the credit agreements with our senior lenders, which are subject to forbearance agreements that expire on April 15, 2019, and our asset-based revolving line of credit agreement matures on April 15, 2019. We are also in default under the Credit Agreement with NovellusDx Ltd.\nWe have been in violation of certain of the financial and other covenants under our asset-based revolving line of credit agreement (\u201cABL\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d) and our term loan agreement (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) with Partners for Growth IV, L.P. (\u201cPFG\u201d). On August 20, 2018, the Company received waivers from its senior lenders for the covenant violations for the months of July and August 2018. In consideration of these waivers, we agreed to reduce the maximum borrowings under the ABL from $6.0 million to $3.0 million, and agreed to enter into a binding and enforceable agreement satisfactory to each lender by August 31, 2018 with respect to a merger or other business combination transaction between the Company and an unrelated third party satisfactory to each lender (the \u201cTransaction Condition\u201d). While we were in violation of the Transaction Condition as of August 31, we subsequently entered into a binding and enforceable agreement satisfactory to each lender on September 18, 2018 by entering into a Merger Agreement with NovellusDx Ltd. (\u201cNovellus\u201d) and the other\nparties thereto (which was subsequently terminated in December 2018) (the \u201cNovellus Merger Agreement\u201d). On November 19, 2018, we obtained waivers from our lenders for the covenant violations for the months of September, October and November 2018, conditioned upon the Company raising $3,000,000 through the sale of its equity securities or issuance of subordinated debt by November 30, 2018 (the \u201cFinancing Condition\u201d).\nOn January 16, 2019, we entered into a Forbearance and Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cForbearance and Amendment\u201d) with SVB, further amending the ABL, and a Forbearance Agreement and Modification No. 4 to Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cForbearance and Modification\u201d) with PFG, further amending the Term Loan.\nThe Forbearance and Amendment with SVB, among other things, (i) amended the interest rate under the ABL to be 2.25% per annum above the Wall Street Journal prime rate (7.75% at December 31, 2018); (ii) requires us to comply with certain milestones in connection with progressing towards a potential strategic transaction satisfactory to SVB with an anticipated closing date of on or before April 15, 2019, similar to the Transaction Condition in our August 2018 waivers (the \u201cMilestones\u201d), (iii) provides for SVB\u2019s forbearance of its rights and remedies resulting from certain existing and potential events of default under the ABL stated in the Forbearance and Amendment (but not a waiver) until the earlier of (a) the occurrence of an additional event of default or (b) February 28, 2019; provided such date shall be automatically extended to April 15, 2019 so long as we are in compliance with the Milestones required as of such date and (iv) extends the Revolving Line Maturity Date (as defined in the ABL) to April 15, 2019. Absent the covenant waivers, we would be required to make monthly interest payments at the default rate (10.75%).\nThe Forbearance and Modification with PFG, among other things, (i) requires the Company to comply with certain milestones in connection with progress in towards a potential strategic transaction satisfactory to PFG with an anticipated closing date of on or before April 15, 2019, similar to the Transaction Condition in our August 2018 waivers (the \u201cPFG Milestones\u201d), (ii) provides for PFG\u2019s forbearance of its rights and remedies resulting from certain existing and potential events of default under the Term Loan stated in the Forbearance and Modification (but not a wavier) until the earlier of (a) the occurrence of an additional event of default or (b) February 28, 2019; provided such date shall be automatically extended to April 15, 2019 so long as the Company is in compliance with the PFG Milestones required as of such date. Absent the covenant waivers, we would be required to make monthly interest payments at the default rate (17.50%).\nThe Company will not be able to close on a strategic transaction on or before April 15, 2019. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to extend the maturity of the ABL beyond April 15, 2019 or extend the forbearances with SVB and PFG beyond April 15, 2019. However, we are in discussions with SVB and PFG about possible extensions of the forbearance agreements.\nAs a result of the termination of the Novellus Merger Agreement in December 2018, pursuant to the Credit Agreement (the \u201cNovellus Credit Agreement\u201d), dated September 18, 2018, between us and NovellusDx Ltd., the $1.5 million advance previously made to us in connection with the signing of the Novellus Merger Agreement, plus interest thereon, would have become due and payable, but for the subordination agreements described below. The interest rate under the Novellus Credit Agreement was increased to the lesser of 21% per annum and the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. In addition, NovellusDx Ltd. has the right to convert all, but not less than all, of the outstanding balance under the Novellus Credit Agreement into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.606 per share.\nPursuant to subordination agreements entered into in connection with the Novellus Credit Agreement on September 18, 2018, NovellusDx Ltd.\u2019s ability to be repaid under the Novellus Credit Agreement is subject to subordination to the ABL and the Term Loan. Novellus has asserted that its obligation to standstill under its subordination agreements will not be applicable at a time when the Company attains certain levels of unrestricted cash, as a result of the Company purportedly having improperly terminated the Novellus Merger Agreement. The Company does not believe it improperly terminated the Novellus Merger Agreement.\nOur default under the Novellus Credit Agreement may also be deemed to be a default under the obligations to SVB and PFG.\nAny default under any financing agreement or material agreement of ours (other than the Novellus Credit Agreement) may also be deemed to be a default under the obligations due under the Convertible Promissory Note (the \u201cIliad Note\u201d), dated July 17, 2018, in the aggregate principal amount of $2,625,000.00 to Iliad Research and Trading, L.P. (\u201cIliad\u201d).\nPursuant to subordination agreements entered into in connection with the Iliad Note on July 17, 2018, Iliad\u2019s ability to be repaid under the Iliad Note is subject to subordination to the ABL and the Term Loan. However, the Iliad Note and the subordination agreements between Iliad and our senior lenders provide that on an Event of Default (as defined in the Iliad\nNote), Iliad may obtain injunctive relief that would prohibit the Company from issuing any equity securities unless the outstanding balance due to Iliad is paid in full simultaneously with such issuance. On February 15, 2019, the Company entered into a standstill agreement with Iliad. The standstill agreement, among other things, (i) provided that Iliad would not seek to redeem any portion of the Iliad Note until March 10, 2019 (the \u201cStandstill\u201d); (ii) increased the outstanding balance of the Iliad Note by approximately $139,000, representing a fee to Iliad for such Standstill; and (iii) allowed the Company the option to elect that Iliad not seek to redeem any portion of the Iliad Note until April 15, 2019, provided that upon such election the outstanding balance of the Iliad Note would increase again by approximately $63,000. The Company elected to extend the Standstill until April 15, 2019.\nWe currently have limited funds and we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations.\nWe will need to raise additional financing to fund our operations. At December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $0.2 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $12.6 million and $13.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We have continued to have negative cash flow in the first quarter of 2019.\nEven with the net proceeds of approximately $5.4 million received in our offerings of common stock that were consummated on January 14, 2019 and January 31, 2019 (the \u201cOffering Proceeds\u201d), we have limited availability under our asset-based revolving line of credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.\nThe Company has retained Raymond James & Associates, Inc. as a financial advisor to assist the Company in its evaluation of a broad range of financial and strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including additional capital raising transactions, the acquisition of another company or complementary assets or the potential sale or merger of the Company, disposition of non-core assets, or another type of strategic partnership. There is no assurance that the review of strategic alternatives will result in the Company changing its business plan, pursuing any particular transaction, if any, or, if it pursues any such transaction, that it will be completed. The Company does not expect to make further public comment regarding the strategic review until the Board of Directors has approved a specific transaction or otherwise deems disclosure of significant developments is appropriate.\nWe believe that our current cash and availability under our revolving line of credit, together with the Offering Proceeds, will support operations for approximately 3 months from the date of this report, assuming we are able to negotiate an extension of the maturity date of the ABL and an extension of the forbearances with SVB and PFG. We can provide no assurances that any additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, when needed. Our forecast of the period of time through which our current financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the costs to support our general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development activities are forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties. Absent sufficient additional financing, we may be unable to remain a going concern.\nAdditional financing may be from the sale of equity or convertible or other debt securities in a public or private offering, from an additional or new credit facility or from a strategic partnership coupled with an investment in us or a combination of forms. We continue to evaluate our operations and take steps to improve our operating cash flow. We can provide no assurances that our current actions will be successful or that any additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, when needed. Furthermore, certain provisions of the securities purchase agreements we entered into in May 2016 and September 2016, may limit our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all, including a prohibition on entering into variable rate transactions, such as an equity line, while the 5-year warrants issued in May and September 2016 remain outstanding. Our convertible debt facility entered into in July 2018 has a similar limitation on variable rate financings. Our failure to raise additional capital and in sufficient amounts when needed may significantly impact our ability to operate our business. For further discussion of our liquidity requirements, see the section titled \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Resources and Expenditure Requirements.\u201d\nWe also may need to raise capital to expand our business to meet our long-term business objectives, including to:\n\u2022\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts to drive market adoption and address competitive developments;\n\u2022\nfund development, validation and marketing efforts of current and future tests;\n\u2022\ncomply with current and evolving regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nfurther expand our clinical laboratory operations;\n\u2022\nexpand our technologies into other types of cancer;\n\u2022\nacquire, license or invest in technologies;\n\u2022\nacquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and\n\u2022\nfinance capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.\nOur present and future funding requirements and our forecast of the period of time through which our current financial resources will be adequate to support our operations will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve revenue growth;\n\u2022\nour ability to extend and amend our credit agreements;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to reduce our costs and improve our operational efficiency;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and obtain approvals for our new diagnostic tests and the costs associated with such research and development activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute on our marketing and sales strategy for our tests and services and gain acceptance of our tests and services in the market;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain adequate reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payors for our tests and services;\n\u2022\nthe costs, scope, progress, results, timing and outcomes of the clinical trials of our diagnostic tests;\n\u2022\nthe costs of operating and enhancing our laboratory facilities;\n\u2022\nthe costs of additional general and administrative personnel;\n\u2022\nthe timing of and the costs involved in regulatory compliance, particularly if the regulations relating to laboratory developed tests (\u201cLDTs\u201d) change;\n\u2022\nthe timing of and costs involved in regulatory compliance, particularly if the regulations relating the PPACA (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) change;\n\u2022\nthe costs of maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including potential litigation costs and liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\ncosts related to international expansion; and\n\u2022\nour ability to secure financing and the amount thereof.\nThe various ways we could raise additional capital carry potential risks. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, those debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our capital stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations and increase our interest expense. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or tests, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nAdditional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we cannot secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or sales and marketing initiatives. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are not able to remediate the material weakness and otherwise maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us and the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of SOX, or Section 404, requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to our controls over accounting for uncollectible Clinical Services revenue, which prevented the Company from identifying and properly recording contractual allowances during the fourth quarter. As a result, amounts that should have been reported as reductions in revenue were instead reported as bad debt expense. We are committed to remediating the material weakness. We have begun the process of implementing changes to our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weakness, including further improvements in our processes and analyses that support the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the related bad debt expense and performing a comprehensive review of the need for additional corporate accounting and financial personnel, supplemented by external resources as appropriate, with the requisite skill and technical expertise. We had expected this deficiency to be corrected as part of the implementation of ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018.\nHowever, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we noted that the material weakness in our revenue and cash receipts process has continued in 2018 as our remediation efforts were not adequate. As a result, additional amounts had to be recorded as bad debt expense for older balances. Based on a change in financial leadership in late November 2018, we have demonstrated a commitment to remediate the material weakness in a timely fashion. We have begun the process of implementing changes to our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weakness, including further improvements in our processes and analyses that support the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the related bad debt expense. We have noted the need for additional corporate accounting and financial personnel, supplemented by external resources as appropriate, with the requisite skill and technical expertise. We expect this deficiency to be corrected by the end of 2019.\nIf our steps are insufficient to successfully remediate the material weakness and otherwise establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us and the value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. For as long as we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the U.S. securities laws, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nMoreover, we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us.\nWe are engaged in shareholder litigation.\nFollowing periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. On April 5, 2018 and April 12, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed nearly identical putative class action lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, against the Company, Panna L. Sharma, John A. Roberts, and Igor Gitelman, captioned Ben Phetteplace v. Cancer Genetics, Inc. et al., No. 2:18-cv-05612 and Ruo Fen Zhang v. Cancer Genetics, Inc. et al., No. 2:18-06353, respectively. The complaints alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 based on allegedly false and misleading statements and omissions regarding our business, operational, and financial results. The lawsuits sought, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages in connection with purchases of our stock between March 23, 2017 and April 2, 2018, as well as interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. On August 28, 2018, the Court consolidated the two actions in one action captioned In re Cancer Genetics, Inc. Securities Litigation (the \u201cSecurities Litigation\u201d) and appointed shareholder Randy Clark as the lead plaintiff. On October 30, 2018, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint, adding Edward Sitar as a defendant and seeking, among other things, compensatory damages in connection with purchases of CGI stock between March 10, 2016 and April 2, 2018. On December 31, 2018, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the Securities Litigation and therefore cannot estimate possible losses or ranges of losses, if any.\nIn addition, on June 1, 2018, September 20, 2018, and September 25, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed nearly identical derivative lawsuits on behalf of the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company (as a nominal defendant) and current and former members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and current and former officers of the Company. The three cases are captioned: Bell v. Sharma et al., No. 2:18-cv-10009-CCC-MF, McNeece v. Pappajohn et al., No. 2:18-cv-14093, and Workman v. Pappajohn, et al., No. 2:18-cv-14259 (the \u201cDerivative Litigation\u201d). The complaints allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty, violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (premised upon alleged omissions in the Company\u2019s 2017 proxy statement), and unjust enrichment, and allege that the individual defendants failed to implement and maintain adequate controls, which resulted in ineffective disclosure controls and procedures, and conspired to conceal this alleged failure. The lawsuits seek, among other things, damages and/or restitution to the Company, appropriate equitable relief to remedy the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On November 9, 2018, the Court in the Bell v. Sharma action entered a stipulation filed by the parties staying the Bell action until\nthe Securities Litigation is dismissed, with prejudice, and all appeals have been exhausted; or the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss in the Securities Litigation is denied in whole or in part; or either of the parties in the Bell action gives 30 days\u2019 notice that they no longer consent to the stay. On December 10, 2018, the parties in the McNeece action filed a stipulation that is substantially identical to the Bell stipulation. On February 1, 2019, the Court in the Workman action granted a stipulation that is substantially identical to the Bell stipulation. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the Derivative Litigation and therefore cannot estimate possible losses or ranges of losses, if any.\nAdditional shareholder lawsuits may be filed in the future. We may not be successful in defending ourselves in litigation or arbitration which may result in large judgments or settlements against us, any of which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, lawsuits can be expensive to defend, whether or not they have merit, and the defense of these actions may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in managing our business. Our liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to satisfy, or may not cover, any expenses or liabilities that may arise.\nOur outstanding warrants and stock options may have an adverse effect on the market price of shares of our common stock.\nAs of March 11, 2019, we had issued and outstanding warrants to purchase 12,053,541 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $3.14 per share and outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 2,344,171 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $4.79 per share. We also had approximately 3,745,800 shares issuable upon the conversion of the Iliad Note, at a conversion price of $0.80 per share, and approximately 2,661,364 shares issuable upon the conversion of the outstanding balance under the Novellus Credit Agreement at a conversion price of $0.606 per share. The sale, or even the possibility of sale, and the uncertainty with respect to the timing of any sales, of the shares underlying these securities, particularly the warrants, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and on our ability to obtain future financing at prices we deem satisfactory, or at all. If and to what extent these warrants and/or options are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings.\nWe are not currently in compliance with the continued listing requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we do not regain compliance and continue to meet the continued listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could affect the market price and liquidity for our common stock and reduce our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements including, without limitation, a requirement that our closing bid price be at least $1.00 per share, and that we hold an annual meeting of stockholders within twelve months of the end of our fiscal year.\nOn January 29, 2019, the Company received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notifying the Company that it was required to seek stockholder approval of the execution of the Novellus Credit Agreement, under which the Company was advanced $1.5 million, the outstanding balance of which, including interest, is convertible, at the option of Novellus, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.606 per share, due to the potential for the Company, upon a conversion of such outstanding balance, with interest, to be required to issue common stock at a discount to the market price of the common stock on the day of execution of such agreement in excess of 20% of the pre-transaction outstanding shares of common stock, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) (the \u201cApproval Requirement\u201d). The obligation was convertible into 2,475,248 shares (or approximately 8.9% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock) on the date of entry into the Novellus Credit Agreement. The Company had contemplated that the Novellus Credit Agreement would be paid off or otherwise retired in advance of any time at which the outstanding balance under such agreement could have been convertible into common stock in excess of the 20% threshold, due to both the Novellus Merger Agreement and the Novellus Credit Agreement having end dates of March 31, 2019. However, as the Novellus Merger Agreement was terminated in December 2018 before shareholder approval was sought, the Company potentially may be required to issue shares of common stock upon conversion under such agreement in excess of such threshold at a future date.\nNasdaq\u2019s notice had no immediate effect on the listing of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(C), the Company had 45 calendar days from January 29, 2019, or until March 15, 2019, to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Approval Requirement, which the Company submitted on March 15, 2019. If Nasdaq accepts the Company\u2019s plan, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from January 29, 2019, or July 28, 2019, to regain compliance. If Nasdaq does not accept the Company\u2019s plan, the Company will have the right to appeal such decision to a Nasdaq hearings panel. There can be no assurance that Nasdaq will accept the Company\u2019s plan or that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the Approval Requirement or maintain compliance with any other Nasdaq requirement in the future.\nOn January 3, 2019, we received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff Nasdaq notifying us that we no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) due to our failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders within twelve months of the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the \u201cAnnual Meeting Requirement\u201d). We had contemplated holding our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders simultaneously with seeking stockholder approval of the Novellus Merger Agreement. As the Novellus Merger Agreement was terminated in December 2018 before any approval was sought, we still need to schedule an annual meeting.\nNasdaq\u2019s notice had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(G), we had 45 calendar days from January 3, 2019, or until February 19, 2019, to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Requirement, which we submitted on February 19, 2019. If Nasdaq accepts our plan, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from December 31, 2018, the date of our fiscal year end for our last fiscal year, or July 1, 2019, to regain compliance. If Nasdaq does not accept our plan, we will have the right to appeal such decision to a Nasdaq hearings panel.\nThere can be no assurance that Nasdaq will accept our plan or that we will be able to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Requirement or maintain compliance with any other Nasdaq requirement in the future.\nOn November 13, 2018, we received a written notice from Nasdaq indicating that we are not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We have 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance, or until May 13, 2019. We can regain compliance if at any time during this 180 day period the bid price of our common stock closes at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days.\nWe intend to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and consider our available options to resolve our noncompliance with the minimum bid price requirement, which may include submitting for approval by our stockholders a proposal to grant discretionary authority to our board of directors to amend our certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse split of our outstanding shares of common stock within an appropriate range, with the exact reverse split ratio to be decided and publicly announced by the board of directors prior to the effective time of the amendment to our certificate of incorporation. No determination regarding our response has been made at this time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or we will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria.\nIf we fail to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement, the Annual Meeting Requirement or the Approval Requirement or to meet the other applicable continued listing requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market in the future and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock and reduce our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and the trading price remains below $5.00 per share, trading in our common stock might also become subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, which require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trade involving a stock defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d (generally, any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on Nasdaq that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions).\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Strategy\nIf we are unable to increase sales of our tests and services or to successfully develop and commercialize other proprietary tests, our revenues will be insufficient for us to achieve profitability.\nWe currently derive substantially all of our revenues from our testing services and laboratory and CRO services at the premarket stage. We have only recently begun offering our proprietary Focus::NGS\u00ae panels through our CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited and state licensed laboratories. We are in varying stages of research and development for other diagnostic tests that we may offer.\nBiopharma Services are services and tests provided to pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations in connection with phase I, phase II or phase III studies for development of therapeutic drugs. The nature of these services is that they tend to come in relatively large projects but episodically, rather than providing steady sources of revenues. It is unclear at this stage of our development whether we will be able to maintain and grow the number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations who will avail themselves of our services, or how regular a flow of drug development projects we will be able to obtain from existing customers.\nDiscovery Services are services that include proprietary preclinical test systems supporting our clinical diagnostic and prognostic offerings at early stages, supporting the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology companies and academic research centers. In particular, our preclinical development of biomarker detection methods, response to immuno-oncology directed\nnovel treatments and early prediction of clinical outcome is supported by our extended portfolio of orthotopic, xenografts and syngeneic tumor test systems. Since this acquisition if relatively new, it is unclear whether we will be able to maintain and grow the number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations who will avail themselves of our services, or how regular a flow of drug development projects we will be able to obtain from existing customers.\nIf we are unable to increase sales of our tests and services or to successfully develop, validate and commercialize other diagnostic tests, we will not produce sufficient revenues to become profitable.\nIf pathologists and oncologists decide not to order our diagnostic tests and/or pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations decide not to use our diagnostic tests and services and our CRO services in connection with their clinical trials, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our business.\nTo generate demand for our Clinical Services, we will need to educate oncologists and pathologists on the clinical utility, benefits and value of each type of test we provide through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education sessions by members of our sales force. In addition, we will need to assure oncologists and pathologists of our ability to obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. To generate demand for our Biopharma Services and Discovery Services, we need to educate pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations on the utility of our tests and services to improve the outcomes of clinical trials for new oncology drugs and more rapidly advance targeted therapies through the clinical development process through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education sessions by members of our sales force. We may need to hire additional commercial, scientific, technical and other personnel to support this process. If we cannot convince medical practitioners, pharmaceutical and biotech companies or clinical research organizations to order our diagnostic tests or other future tests we develop, we will likely be unable to create demand for our tests in sufficient volume for us to achieve sustained profitability.\nThe potential loss or delay of our large contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect our results.\nMost of our Discovery Services customers can terminate our contracts upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice. These customers may delay, terminate or reduce the scope of our contracts for a variety of reasons beyond our control, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndecisions to forego or terminate a particular clinical trial;\n\u2022\nlack of available financing, budgetary limits or changing priorities;\n\u2022\nfailure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria;\n\u2022\nunexpected or undesired clinical results for products; or\n\u2022\nshift of business to a competitor or internal resources.\nAs a result, contract terminations, delays and alterations are a possible outcome in our Discovery Services business. In the event of termination, our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project, but these fees may not be sufficient for us to maintain our margins, and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates. In addition, we may not realize the full benefits of our backlog of contractually committed services if our customers cancel, delay or reduce their commitments under our contracts with them, which may occur if, among other things, a customer decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider. Thus, the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. We believe the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where we are party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies.\nThe commercial success of our Clinical Services business could be compromised if third-party payors, including insurance companies, managed care organizations and Medicare, do not provide coverage and reimbursement, breach, rescind or modify their contracts or reimbursement policies or delay payments for our molecular diagnostic tests.\nPathologists and oncologists may not order our molecular diagnostic tests unless third-party payors, such as insurance companies, managed care organizations and government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay a substantial portion of the test price. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our molecular diagnostic tests. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that tests using our technologies are:\n\u2022\nnot experimental or investigational;\n\u2022\nmedically necessary;\n\u2022\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022\ncost-effective;\n\u2022\nsupported by peer-reviewed publications; and\n\u2022\nincluded in clinical practice guidelines.\nUncertainty surrounds third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of any test incorporating new technology, including tests developed using our NGS panels. Technology assessments of new medical tests and devices conducted by research centers and other entities may be disseminated to interested parties for informational purposes. Even if we obtain marketing clearance or approval to market molecular diagnostic tests, or where we have acquired the rights to already cleared or approved products, our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidates and acquired products have received clearance or approval, and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share for our product candidates and acquired products in those markets.\nThird-party payors and health care providers may use such technology assessments as grounds to deny coverage for a test or procedure. For example, on March 16, 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) finalized a National Coverage Determination (\u201cNCD\u201d) that covers diagnostic laboratory tests using Next Generation Sequencing (\u201cNGS\u201d) for patients with advanced cancer (i.e., recurrent, metastatic, relapsed, refractory, or stages III or IV cancer). Under the NCD, CMS will cover FDA-approved or cleared companion in vitro diagnostics when the test has an FDA-approved or cleared indication for use in that patient\u2019s cancer and results are provided to the treating physician for management of the patient using a report template to specify treatment options. Tests that gain FDA approval or clearance as an in vitro companion diagnostic will automatically receive full coverage under this final NCD, provided other coverage criteria are also met. However, coverage determinations for other diagnostic laboratory tests (i.e. not companion diagnostics) using NGS for Medicare patients with advanced cancer will be made by local Medicare Administrative Contractors (\u201cMACs\u201d). Local coverage determinations will vary, and may affect reimbursement rates, if any, that may be offered for tests developed using our NGS panels.\nBecause each payor generally determines for its own enrollees or insured patients whether to cover or otherwise establish a policy to reimburse our diagnostic tests, seeking payor approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. For our FDA-approved Tissue of Origin \u00ae test, we are currently working with CMS to negotiate an increased CFLS rate for our FDA-approved test, and are exploring additional reimbursement arrangement with third-party payors. We cannot be certain that coverage for our tests (FDA-cleared/approved or LDT) will be provided in the future by additional third-party payors or that existing contracts, agreements or policy decisions or reimbursement levels will remain in place or be fulfilled under existing terms and provisions. If we cannot obtain coverage and reimbursement from private and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid for our current tests, or new tests or test enhancements that we may develop in the future, our ability to generate revenues from our clinical services could be limited, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Further, we have experienced in the past, and will likely experience in the future, delays and temporary interruptions in the receipt of payments from third-party payors due to missing documentation and other issues, which could cause delay in collecting our revenue.\nOur quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations and may be difficult to forecast.\nIn recent years, we have been expanding our Biopharma Services business. The nature of these services is that they tend to come in relatively large projects but episodically, rather than providing steady sources of revenues. The timing, size and duration of our contracts with pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations depend on the size, pace and duration of such customer\u2019s clinical trial, over which we have no control and sometimes limited visibility. In addition, our expense levels are based, in part, on expectation of future revenue levels. A shortfall in expected revenue could, therefore, result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income. As a result, our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations and may be difficult to forecast.\nIf we are unable to successfully validate our laboratory tests and services, we will not be able to increase revenues.\nPathologists and oncologists may not order our proprietary tests, and third-party payors may not reimburse for our tests, unless we are able to provide compelling evidence that the tests are useful to patient treatment and produce actionable information with respect to the diagnosis, prognosis and theranosis of the various cancers on which our work is focused. In addition, pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations may not order our proprietary tests unless we are able to provide compelling evidence that such tests improve the outcomes of clinical trials for new oncology drugs and allow pharmaceutical and biotech companies to more rapidly advance targeted therapeutics. While we have successfully validated all of the tests that we currently offer through: the FDA for our FDA-cleared TOO\u00ae test, and CAP, CLIA, the New York Clinical Lab Evaluation Program (CLEP) Validation Unit, through our pharmaceutical clients and partners for our lab-developed tests,\nwe believe that we will need to finance and successfully complete additional and more powerful studies, and then effectively disseminate the results of those studies, to drive widespread adoption of our tests and thereby increase our revenues.\nIf the market for our tests and services does not experience significant growth or if our tests and services do not achieve broad acceptance, our operations will suffer.\nWe cannot accurately predict the future growth rate or the size of the market for our tests and services. The expansion of this market depends on a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe cost, performance and reliability of our tests and services, and the tests and services offered by competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomers' perceptions regarding the benefits of our tests and services;\n\u2022\ncustomers' satisfaction with our tests and services; and\n\u2022\nmarketing efforts and publicity regarding our tests and services.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected if we underprice our contracts, overrun our cost estimates or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders.\nMost of our Discovery Services contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixed-fee contracts. Our past financial results have been, and our future financial results may be, adversely impacted if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates and are unable to successfully negotiate a change order. Change orders typically occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated by our contract with the customer. Modifications can occur, for example, when there is a change in a key clinical trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing. Where we are not successful in converting out-of-scope work into change orders under our current contracts, we bear the cost of the additional work. Such underpricing, significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIf we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed.\nIn connection with our Discovery Services business, we contract with biopharmaceutical companies to provide specialized services to assist them in planning and conducting unique, specialized studies to guide drug discovery and development programs with a concentration in oncology and immuno-oncology. Our services include monitoring clinical trials, data and laboratory analysis, electronic data capture and other related services. Such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations. If we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements, regulatory agencies may take action against us for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials. Customers may also bring claims against us for breach of our contractual obligations. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nSuch consequences could arise if, among other things, the following occur:\nImproper performance of our services. The performance of clinical development services is complex and time-consuming. For example, we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly. If the clinical trial results are compromised, we could be subject to significant costs or liability, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services. As examples:\n\u2022\nnon-compliance generally could result in the termination of ongoing clinical trials or sales and marketing projects or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncompromise of data from a particular clinical trial, such as failure to verify that informed consent was obtained from patients, could require us to repeat the clinical trial under the terms of our contract at no further cost to our customer, but at a substantial cost to us; and\n\u2022\nbreach of a contractual term could result in liability for damages or termination of the contract.\nWhile we endeavor to contractually limit our exposure to such risks, improper performance of our services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, damage our reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected customer or other customers.\nInvestigation of customers. From time to time, one or more of our customers are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials, programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs. There is a risk that either our customers or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance. If our customers or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them, we could be subject to damages, fines or penalties. In addition, negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our customers\u2019 clinical trials, programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nIf we fail to perform our Biopharma Services in accordance with contractual and regulatory requirements, and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability.\nThrough our Biopharma Services offering, we contract with pharmaceutical and biotech companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new therapeutics to market. Our services include data and laboratory analysis, clinical trial design consulting, data capture and other related services. Such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations. If we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements, regulatory authorities may take action against us or our customers. Such actions may include failure of such regulatory authority to grant marketing approval of our customers\u2019 products, imposition of holds or delays, suspension or withdrawal of clearances or approvals, rejection of data collected, laboratory license revocation, product recalls, operational restrictions, civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions, damages or fines. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to manage growth in our business, our prospects may be limited and our future results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe intend to continue with our research and development activities, our sales and marketing programs and other activities as needed to meet future demand. Any significant expansion may strain our managerial, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage such growth, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. We will need to improve continually our operations, financial and other internal systems to manage its growth effectively, and any failure to do so may lead to inefficiencies and redundancies, and result in reduced growth prospects and diminished operational results.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully commercialize novel cancer diagnostic tests and services, which is time consuming and complex, and our development efforts may fail.\nPart of our business strategy focuses on discovering, developing and commercializing molecular, genomic and genetic diagnostic tests and services. We believe the long-term success of our business depends on our ability to fully validate and commercialize our existing diagnostic tests and services and to develop and commercialize new diagnostic tests. We have multiple tests we are currently offering or may develop, but research, development and commercialization of diagnostic tests is time-consuming, uncertain and complex.\nTests we currently offer in our laboratory, or any additional technologies that we may develop, may not succeed in reliably diagnosing or predicting the recurrence of cancers with the sensitivity and specificity necessary to be clinically useful, and thus may not succeed commercially. In addition, prior to or an in continuing in conjunction with commercializing our diagnostic tests, we must undertake time-consuming and costly development activities, including clinical studies, and obtain regulatory clearance or approval, which may be denied. This development process involves a high degree of risk, substantial expenditures and will occur over several years. Our development efforts may fail for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of the tests at the research or development stage;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in accessing archival tissue samples, especially tissue samples with known clinical results; or\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient clinical validation data to support the effectiveness of the test.\nTests that appear promising in early development may fail to be validated in subsequent studies, and even if we achieve positive results, we may ultimately fail to obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals. There is substantial risk that our research and development projects will not result in commercial tests, and that success in early clinical trials will not be replicated in later studies. At any point, we may abandon development of a test or be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical trials, which would adversely impact the timing for generating potential revenues from that test. In addition, as we develop tests, we will have to make significant investments in research, development and marketing resources. If a clinical validation study of a particular test then fails to demonstrate the outlined goals of the study, we might choose to abandon the development of that test. Further, our ability to develop and launch diagnostic tests will likely depend on our receipt of additional funding. If our discovery and development programs yield fewer commercial tests than we expect, we may\nbe unable to execute our business plan, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if the supply of reagents or equipment on which our tests in development or commercial tests rely becomes unavailable and we have to source replacement reagents or equipment for our tests, additional validation activities will be required and we may need to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for the modified tests.\nWe may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue other acquisitions of businesses and assets. We also may pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage our core technology and industry experience to expand our offerings or distribution. For example, we acquired vivoPharm in 2017, Response Genetics, Inc. in 2015 and Gentris Corporation in 2014, and we entered into a joint venture in May 2013 with Mayo Foundation for Education and Research. We subsequently shut down Response Genetics operations in California and moved them to New Jersey and North Carolina and we are in the process of completing our commitments thereby ending the need for our joint venture with Mayo. We also purchased a business in India in August 2014 which we sold in April 2018. We have developed experience with acquiring other companies and forming strategic alliances and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisitions also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may experience losses related to investments in other companies, which could have a material negative effect on our results of operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture.\nTo finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry, and if we are unable to obtain regulatory clearance or approvals in the United States, if we experience delays in receiving clearance or approvals, or if we do not gain acceptance from other laboratories of any cleared or approved diagnostic tests at their facilities, our growth strategy may not be successful.\nWe currently offer our proprietary tests in conjunction with our comprehensive panel of laboratory services in our CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory. Because we currently offer these tests and services solely for use within our laboratory, we believe we may market the tests as laboratory developed tests (LDTs) under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (\u201cFDA\u2019s\u201d) enforcement framework. Although the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices, including LDTs, are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has generally exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable regulations with respect to LDTs. Specifically, under current FDA enforcement policies and more recent draft guidance, LDTs generally do not require FDA premarket clearance or approval before commercialization, and we have marketed our LDTs on that basis. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations as historically enforced by the FDA, we cannot assure you that the FDA will agree with our determination or that its application and enforcement of its authorities will not change, and a determination that we have violated these laws and regulations, or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. Further, our LDT may be subject to approval by the New York State Clinical Lab Evaluation Program (\u201cCLEP\u201d). New York state\u2019s clinical laboratory regulatory program is exempt from CLIA, and maintains its own policies and procedures for evaluating and approving commercial LDTs for use in New York or on individuals residing in New York. New York LDT approval can be lengthy processes, which could delay our ability to market our tests to doctors and patients in this state.\nIf we were to offer our tests through third-party laboratories, these tests would most likely not be subject to the FDA\u2019s current exercise of enforcement discretion over LDTs, and would be subject to the applicable medical device regulations. For example, these tests could become subject to the FDA\u2019s requirements for premarket review. Unless an exemption applies, generally, before a new medical device or a new use for a medical device may be sold or distributed in the United States, the medical device must receive premarket marketing authorization from the FDA, which is generally either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or premarket approval of a PMA application. As a result, before we can market or distribute our tests in\nthe United States for use by other clinical testing laboratories, we must first obtain premarket marketing authorization (generally referred to as premarket clearance or premarket approval throughout this document) from the FDA. We have not yet applied for clearance or approval from the FDA, and would need to complete additional validations before we are ready to apply. We believe it would likely take two years or more to conduct the studies and trials necessary to obtain approval from the FDA to commercially launch any of our proprietary products outside of our clinical laboratory. Once we do apply, we may not receive FDA clearance or approval for the commercial use of our tests on a timely basis, or at all. If we are unable to obtain clearance or approval or if clinical diagnostic laboratories do not accept our tests, our ability to grow our business by deploying our tests could be compromised.\nOur laboratory may also require an out-of-state laboratory operations permit to accept and perform diagnostic tests on specimens from residents of California, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, New Jersey and New York. Failure to obtain a permit to operate as an out-of-state laboratory in any of these or other locations could result in fines, refusal by the relevant state regulatory authority to issue a permit in the future, and adversely affect our ability to market our products in the future. The laboratory permitting application and approval process can be lengthy, which may further delay our ability to market our lab services and products in these states.\nWe do not have immediate plans to market our tests for commercial use in the European Union and as a result, at this time we do not believe we are subject to EU or EU member state post-market regulations related to our tests.\nThe FDA may impose additional regulatory obligations and costs upon our business.\nOn October 3, 2014 the FDA issued two draft guidance documents regarding its intent to modify its policy of enforcement discretion and increase oversight over LDTs. The two draft guidance documents are entitled \u201cFramework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)\u201d (the \u201cFramework Draft Guidance\u201d) and \u201cFDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Test (LDTs)\u201d (the \u201cNotification Draft Guidance\u201d). In the Framework Draft Guidance, FDA stated that after the Guidances are finalized, it no longer would exercise enforcement discretion with respect to most LDTs and instead would regulate them in a risk-based manner consistent with the existing classification of medical devices. The Framework Draft Guidance stated that within six months after the Guidances were finalized, all laboratories would be required to give notice to the FDA and provide basic information concerning the nature of the LDTs offered. The FDA then would begin a phased-in review of the LDTs available, based on the risk associated with the tests. For the highest risk LDTs, which the FDA classifies as Class III devices, the Framework Draft Guidance stated that the FDA would begin to require premarket review within 12 months after the Guidance was finalized. Other high risk LDTs would be reviewed over the next four years and then lower risk tests (Class II tests) would be reviewed in the following four to nine years. The Framework Draft Guidance stated that FDA expected to issue a separate Guidance describing the criteria for its risk-based classification 18-24 months after the Guidances were finalized.\nOn November 18, 2016, the FDA stated that it would not be issuing final guidance on regulation of LDTs and, instead, it would outline its view of an appropriate risk-based approach to LDTs. On January 13, 2017, the FDA released a \u201cDiscussion Paper on Laboratory Developed Tests\u201d that synthesizes the feedback that the agency received from various stakeholders on FDA regulation of LDTs \u201cwith the hope that it advances public discussion on LDT oversight.\u201d The FDA stated in the introduction to the discussion paper: \u201cThe synthesis does not represent the formal thinking of the FDA, nor is it enforceable\u2026This document does not represent a final version of the LDT draft guidance documents that were published in 2014.\u201d Rather, its purpose is to allow for further public discussion and to give Congress a chance to develop a legislative solution. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has stated publicly that it would be preferable for Congress to develop a clear legislative framework for the FDA to implement, rather than for the FDA to regulate LDTs through guidance documents. A number of Congressional committees of the 115th Congress reportedly are working with various stakeholders to consider different approaches to regulation of LDTs. On August 3, 2018, FDA provided Congressional committee staff technical assistance on the discussion draft entitled the Diagnostic Accuracy and Innovation Act (DAIA). In FDA\u2019s technical assistance, FDA reiterated that it supported the goal of legislation to create pathways to market for all in vitro clinical tests (IVCTs). It is unclear at this time whether those committees and stakeholders can reach consensus around an approach and develop legislation and whether Congress would pass any such legislation.\nIf we and our tests become subject to FDA\u2019s enforcement of its medical device regulations with respect to LDTs, we may be subject to significant and onerous regulatory obligations. See section entitled \u201cRisk Factors-Regulatory Risks Relating to CGI\u2019s Business-If the FDA regulates LDTs as proposed, then it would classify LDTs according to the current system used to regulate medical devices. Under that system, there are three different classes of medical devices, with the requirements becoming more stringent depending on the Class.\u201d\nIf we are unable to execute our marketing strategy for our tests and our tests are unable to gain acceptance in the market, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our business.\nAlthough we believe that our tests represent promising commercial opportunities, our tests may never gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and therefore may never generate substantial revenue or profits for us. We need to continue to develop a market for our tests through physician education and awareness programs. Gaining acceptance in medical communities requires that we perform additional studies after validating the efficacy of our tests and services for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer, and that we obtain acceptance of the results of those studies using our tests for publication in leading peer-reviewed medical journals. The results of any studies are always uncertain and even if we believe such studies demonstrate the value of our tests, they process of publication in leading medical journals is subject to a peer review process and peer reviewers may not consider the results of our studies sufficiently novel or worthy of publication. Failure to have our studies published in peer-reviewed journals would limit the adoption of our tests. Our ability to successfully market the tests that we may develop will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nwhether health care providers believe our diagnostic tests provide clinical utility;\n\u2022\nwhether the medical community accepts that our diagnostic tests are sufficiently sensitive and specific to be meaningful in-patient care and treatment decisions; and\n\u2022\nwhether health insurers, government health programs and other third-party payors will cover and pay for our diagnostic tests and, if so, whether they will adequately reimburse us.\nFailure to achieve widespread market acceptance of our diagnostic tests would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot develop tests to keep pace with rapid advances in technology, medicine and science, our operating results and competitive position could be harmed.\nIn recent years, there have been numerous advances in technologies relating to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. There are several new cancer drugs under development that may increase patient survival time. There have also been advances in methods used to analyze very large amounts of genomic information. We must continuously develop new tests and enhance our existing tests to keep pace with evolving standards of care. Our existing tests could become obsolete unless we continually innovate and expand them to demonstrate benefit in patients treated with new therapies. New cancer therapies typically have only a few years of clinical data associated with them, which limits our ability to perform clinical studies and correlate sets of genes to a new treatment\u2019s effectiveness. If we cannot adequately demonstrate the applicability of our tests to new treatments, sales of our tests and services could decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our tests do not continue to perform as expected, our operating results, reputation and business will suffer.\nOur success depends on the market\u2019s confidence that we can continue to provide reliable, high-quality diagnostic tests. We believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to test defects and errors. As a result, the failure of our tests or services to perform as expected would significantly impair our reputation and the public image of our tests and services, and we may be subject to legal claims arising from any defects or errors.\nThere is a scarcity of experienced professionals in our industry. If we are not able to retain and recruit personnel with the requisite technical skills, we may be unable to successfully execute our business strategy.\nThe specialized nature of our industry results in an inherent scarcity of experienced personnel in the field. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel (including medical, scientific, technical, commercial, business, regulatory and administrative personnel) necessary to support our anticipated growth, develop our business and perform certain contractual obligations. Given the scarcity of professionals with the scientific knowledge that we require and the competition for qualified personnel among life science businesses, we may not succeed in attracting or retaining the personnel we require to continue and grow our operations. The loss of a key employee, the failure of a key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees could result in our inability to continue to grow our business or to implement our business strategy.\nThe loss or transition of any member of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, clinicians, and salespeople could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience, and performance of key members of our senior management team. The individual and collective efforts of these employees will be important as we continue to develop our tests and services, and as we expand our commercial activities. The loss or incapacity of existing members of our senior management team could adversely affect our operations if we experience difficulties in hiring qualified successors.\nIn February 2018, Panna Sharma resigned as our chief executive officer and John A. Roberts, then our Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Finance, succeeded him as our interim chief executive officer and was subsequently appointed our President and Chief Executive Officer. The complexity inherent in integrating a new key member of the senior management team with existing senior management may limit the effectiveness of any such successor or otherwise adversely affect our business. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover of other key officers and employees. Specifically, a leadership transition in the commercial team may cause uncertainty about or a disruption to our commercial organization, which may impact our ability to achieve sales and revenue targets.\nOur inability to attract, hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales professionals would hamper our ability to increase demand for our tests, to expand geographically and to successfully commercialize any other diagnostic tests or products we may develop.\nOur success in selling our clinical laboratory services, Biopharma Services, Discovery Services, diagnostic tests and any other tests or products that we are able to develop will require us to expand our sales force in the United States and internationally by recruiting additional sales representatives with extensive experience in oncology and close relationships with medical oncologists, surgeons, pathologists and other hospital personnel, as well as pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations. To achieve our marketing and sales goals, we will need to continue to expand our sales and commercial infrastructure. Sales professionals with the necessary technical and business qualifications are in high demand, and there is a risk that we may be unable to attract, hire and retain the number of sales professionals with the right qualifications, scientific backgrounds and relationships with decision-makers at potential customers needed to achieve our sales goals. We may face competition from other companies in our industry, some of whom are much larger than us and who can pay greater compensation and benefits than we can, in seeking to attract and retain qualified sales and marketing employees. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified sales and marketing personnel, our business will suffer.\nWe have indebtedness with restrictive covenants that limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing and that requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to fund operations, and react to changes in our business.\nAs of March 27, 2019, we had approximately $2.4 million of indebtedness for borrowed money under our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, due April 15, 2019 and $6.0 million under our term loan with Partners for Growth due on March 22, 2020. Repayments of amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be accelerated if an event of default occurs, which includes, among other things, a violation of financial covenants and negative covenants. We are currently in default with respect to certain financial covenants with such lenders, and while we have obtained amendments, waivers and most recently forbearance, the forbearance is only through April 15, 2019, and no assurances can be given that such lenders will agree to waive or amend such covenants and continue to forbear from calling our loan, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern. Further, no assurances can be given than the ABL will be extended beyond its maturity date of April 15, 2019.\nThe agreements restrict us from, among other things, paying cash dividends, incurring debt and entering into certain transactions without the prior consent of the lenders. Our debt and related covenants could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations, limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, reducing the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt; and\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing.\nIf our laboratory facilities become damaged or inoperable, or we are required to vacate any facility, our ability to provide services and pursue our research and development efforts may be jeopardized.\nWe currently derive substantially all of our revenues from our laboratory testing services. We do not have any clinical reference laboratory facilities outside of our facilities in Rutherford, New Jersey, and Morrisville, North Carolina. Our facilities and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including fire, flooding and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our tests or provide laboratory services for some period of time. The inability to perform our tests or the backlog of tests that could develop if any of our facilities is inoperable for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation or relationships with key researchers, collaborators, and customers, and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation in the future. Furthermore, our facilities and the equipment we use to perform our research and development work could be costly and time-consuming to repair or replace.\nAdditionally, a key component of our research and development process involves using biological samples and the resulting data sets and medical histories, as the basis for our diagnostic test development. In some cases, these samples are difficult to obtain. If the parts of our laboratory facilities where we store these biological samples are damaged or compromised, our ability to pursue our research and development projects, as well as our reputation, could be jeopardized. We carry insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nFurther, if any of our laboratories became inoperable we may not be able to license or transfer our proprietary technology to a third-party, with established state licensure and CLIA certification under the scope of which our diagnostic tests could be performed following validation and other required procedures, to perform the tests. Even if we find a third-party with such qualifications to perform our tests, such party may not be willing to perform the tests for us on commercially reasonable terms. Moreover, we believe our tests are currently subject to an exercise of enforcement discretion by the FDA because the tests currently qualify as LDTs. If we are required to find a third-party laboratory to conduct our testing services, we believe the FDA would consider such tests to be medical devices that are no longer subject to its exercise of enforcement discretion for LDTs. In that case, we may be required to obtain premarket clearance or approval prior to offering our tests, which would be time-consuming and costly and could result in delays in our ability to sell or offer our tests.\nIf we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenues or achieve and sustain profitability.\nWe face competition from mainstream diagnostic methods that pathologists and oncologists use and have used for many years. It may be difficult to change the methods or behavior of the referring pathologists and oncologists to incorporate our molecular diagnostic testing in their practices. We believe that we can introduce our diagnostic tests successfully due to their clinical utility and the desire of pathologists and oncologists to find solutions for more accurate diagnosis, prognosis and personalized treatment options for cancer patients.\nWe also face competition from companies that currently offer or are developing products to profile genes, gene expression or protein biomarkers in various cancers. Precision medicine is a new area of science, and we cannot predict what tests others will develop that may compete with or provide results superior to the results we are able to achieve with the tests we develop. Our competitors include public companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Inc., bioTheranostics, Inc., Foundation Medicine, Inc., Genomic Health, Inc., Invitae Corp., Johnson & Johnson, Myriad Genetics Inc., Nant Health, NeoGenomics, Inc., Quest Diagnostics, Interpace Diagnostics, BioCept, Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., and many private companies. We expect that pharmaceutical and biotech companies will increasingly focus attention and resources on the personalized diagnostic sector as the potential and prevalence increases for molecularly targeted oncology therapies approved by FDA along with companion diagnostics.\nWith respect to our clinical laboratory business we face competition from companies such as Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc. (a division of Opko), Invitae Corp., LabCorp, NeoGenomics, Inc., Quest Diagnostics, BioCept and Interpace Diagnostics. With respect to our Discovery Services, including our CRO services, we face competition from companies that offer or are developing animal models for tumors and that have capabilities in toxicology and pharmacology testing. Our competitors in our Discovery Services business include Champions Oncology, Crown BioScience (recently acquired by JSR Life Sciences), Eurofins Scientific and Explora Biolabs.\nMany of our present and potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial and technical resources and development, production and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop lower-priced, less complex tests that payors, pathologists and oncologists could view as functionally equivalent to our tests, which could force us to lower the list price of our tests and impact our operating margins and our ability to achieve profitability. In addition, technological innovations that result in the creation of enhanced diagnostic tools may enable other clinical laboratories, hospitals, physicians or medical providers to provide specialized diagnostic services similar to ours in a more patient-friendly,\nefficient or cost-effective manner than is currently possible. If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance and sales of our tests, which could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues or achieving or sustaining profitability.\nA small number of test ordering sites account for most of the sales of our tests and services. If any of these sites orders fewer tests from us for any reason, our revenues could decline.\nDue to the early stage nature of our business and our limited sales and marketing activities to date, we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of test ordering sites, although the test ordering sites that generate a significant portion of our revenue may change from period to period. Our test ordering sites are largely hospitals, cancer centers, reference laboratories and physician offices, as well as pharmaceutical and biotech companies as part of a clinical trial. Oncologists and pathologists at these sites order the tests on behalf of the needs of their oncology patients or as part of a clinical trial sponsored by a pharmaceutical and biotech company in which the patient is being enrolled. During the year ended December 31, 2018, no Biopharma client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2017 one Biopharma client accounted for approximately 11% of our revenue.\nIf we fail to perform our Biopharma Services in accordance with contractual and regulatory requirements, and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability.\nThrough our Biopharma Services offering, we contract with pharmaceutical and biotech companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new therapeutics to market. Our services include monitoring clinical trials, data and laboratory analysis, clinical trial design consulting, data capture and other related services. Such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations. If we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements, regulatory authorities may take action against us or our customers. Such actions may include failure of such regulatory authority to grant marketing approval of our customers\u2019 products, imposition of holds or delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, rejection of data collected, laboratory license revocation, product recalls, operational restrictions, civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions, damages or fines. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses to develop and market our diagnostic tests, which could make it difficult for us to achieve and sustain profitability.\nIn recent years, we have incurred significant costs in connection with the development of our diagnostic tests. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our research and development expenses were $2.5 million, which was 9% of our revenue and our sales and marketing expenses were $5.3 million, which was 19% of revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our research and development expenses were $4.8 million, which was 16% of our net revenue and our sales and marketing expenses were $5.0 million, which was 17% of revenue. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to decrease, in absolute dollars, for the foreseeable future as we focus our business strategy on expanding our biopharma business. This change in focus however, does not change our need to validate the clinical utility of our diagnostic tests to obtain adoption or to secure reimbursement for our diagnostic tests from third party payers. We continue to require generating significant revenues in order to achieve sustained profitability.\nWe depend on certain third parties for the supply of certain tissue samples and biological materials that we use in our research and development services and efforts. If the costs of such collaborations increase or the third parties terminate their relationships with us, our business may be materially harmed.\nUnder standard clinical practice in the United States, tumor biopsies removed from patients are chemically preserved, embedded in paraffin wax and stored. Our clinical development relies on our ability to access these archived tumor biopsy samples, as well as information pertaining to their associated clinical outcomes. Other companies often compete with us for access. Additionally, the process of negotiating access to archived samples is lengthy, because it typically involves numerous parties and approvals to resolve complex issues such as usage rights, institutional review board approval, privacy rights, publication rights, intellectual property ownership and research parameters.\nWe have collaboration arrangements with Mayo Clinic, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, the National Cancer Institute, and other institutions who provide us with tissue samples and other biological materials that we use in developing and validating our tests. We do not have any written arrangement with certain third parties, and in many of the cases in which the arrangements are in writing, our relationships are terminable on 30 days\u2019 notice or less. If one or more third parties terminate their relationship with us, we will need to identify other third parties to supply us with tissue samples and biological materials, which could result in a delay in our research and development activities and negatively affect our business.\nWe currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for the reagents and chemistry related to our NGS panels. Any problems, such as disruption of the supply chain or lack of visibility, experienced by these suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of our NGS panels to us until the problem is cured or until we locate and qualify an alternative source of supply.\nThe design of our NGS panels is currently optimized using certain reagents and chemistry, which we have incorporated into our processes, equipment and protocols. We currently purchase these components from a limited number of suppliers. If one or more of these suppliers were to delay or stop producing the required reagents, or if the prices charged us were to increase significantly, we would need to identify another supplier and optimize our NGS panels using new reagents. We could experience delays in performing the NGS panels while finding other acceptable suppliers, which could impact our results of operations.\nIf we were sued for product liability or professional liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale and use of our tests could lead to the filing of product liability claims were someone to allege that our tests failed to perform as designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the test results we provide to pathologists and oncologists or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. A product liability or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend.\nAlthough we believe that our existing product and professional liability insurance is adequate, our insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against product liability or professional liability claims. Any product liability or professional liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could damage our reputation, result in the recall of our tests, or cause current clinical partners to terminate existing agreements and potential clinical partners to seek other partners, any of which could impact our results of operations.\nIf we use biological and hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages.\nOur activities currently require the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials and hazardous materials and chemicals. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject to, on an ongoing basis, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the event of an accident or if we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could lose our permits or approvals or be held liable for damages or penalized with fines.\nOur Discovery Services customers face intense competition from lower cost generic products, which may lower the amount that they spend on our services.\nOur Discovery Services customers face increasing competition from lower cost generic products, which in turn may affect their ability to pursue research and development activities with us. In the United States, EU and Japan, political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic products. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time in the United States and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes, reducing our customers\u2019 sales of that product and their overall profitability. Availability of generic substitutes for our customers\u2019 drugs may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow, which in turn may mean that they would not have surplus capital to invest in research and development and drug commercialization, including in our services. If competition from generic products impacts our customers\u2019 finances such that they decide to curtail our services, our revenues may decline and this could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we cannot support demand for our tests, including successfully managing the evolution of our technology and manufacturing platforms, our business could suffer.\nAs our test volume grows, we will need to increase our testing capacity, implement increases in scale and related processing, customer service, billing, collection and systems process improvements and expand our internal quality assurance program and technology to support testing on a larger scale. We will also need additional certified laboratory scientists and other scientific\nand technical personnel to process these additional tests. Any increases in scale, related improvements and quality assurance may not be successfully implemented and appropriate personnel may not be available. As additional tests are commercialized, we will need to bring new equipment on line, implement new systems, technology, controls and procedures and hire personnel with different qualifications. Failure to implement necessary procedures or to hire the necessary personnel could result in a higher cost of processing or an inability to meet market demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to perform tests on a timely basis at a level consistent with demand, that our efforts to scale our commercial operations will not negatively affect the quality of our test results or that we will respond successfully to the growing complexity of our testing operations. If we encounter difficulty meeting market demand or quality standards for our tests, our reputation could be harmed and our future prospects and business could suffer, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and any failure of these systems could harm our business.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems for significant aspects of our operations. In addition, our third-party billing and collections provider depends upon telecommunications and data systems provided by outside vendors and information we provide on a regular basis. These information technology and telecommunications systems support a variety of functions, including test processing, sample tracking, quality control, customer service and support, billing and reimbursement, research and development activities and our general and administrative activities. Information technology and telecommunications systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information technology and telecommunications systems, failures or significant downtime of our information technology or telecommunications systems or those used by our third-party service providers could prevent us from processing tests, providing test results to pathologists, oncologists, billing payors, processing reimbursement appeals, handling patient or physician inquiries, conducting research and development activities and managing the administrative aspects of our business. Any disruption or loss of information technology or telecommunications systems on which critical aspects of our operations depend could have an adverse effect on our business.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to fines, penalties, liability, and adverse effects to our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party billing and collections provider collect and store sensitive data, including legally Protected Health Information (as that term is defined at 45 C.F.R. \u00a7160.103), personally identifiable information, intellectual property, and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or our customers, payors, and pharmaceutical and biotech partners. The secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our third-party billing and collections provider, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such improper access or disclosure, or loss of information could require us to provide notice to the affected individuals, the press, and regulatory bodies, result in legal claims or proceedings, liability, fines and penalties under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH Act\u201d), their implementing regulations, and similar state laws. Unauthorized access, loss, or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct our analyses, provide test results, bill payors or patients, process claims and appeals, provide customer assistance services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process, and prepare company financial information, provide information about our products and other patient and physician education and outreach efforts through our website, manage the administrative aspects of our business, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d) may impose penalties on a covered entity, such as us, for a failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA. Penalties will vary significantly depending on factors such as the date of the violation, whether the covered entity knew or should have known of the failure to comply, or whether the covered entity\u2019s failure to comply was due to willful neglect. As of October 2018, these penalties include civil monetary penalties of $155 to $57,051per violation, up to an annual, per violation cap of $1,711,533. A single breach incident can result\nin violations of multiple standards, resulting in possible penalties potentially in excess of $1,711,533. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one year imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase to $100,000 and up to five years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses, and to $250,000 and up to 10 years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. The U.S. Department of Justice is responsible for criminal prosecutions under HIPAA.\nHIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to file suit under HIPAA on behalf of state residents. Courts can award damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for HIPAA violations, its standards have been used as the basis for a duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of Protected Health Information.\nIn addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities for compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured Protected Health Information may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator.\nHIPAA further requires covered entities to notify affected individuals \u201cwithout unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach\u201d if their unsecured Protected Health Information is subject to an unauthorized access, use or disclosure. If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported to HHS and local media without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website. If a breach affects fewer than 500 individuals, the covered entity must log it and notify HHS at least annually.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, and data protection laws in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux. California recently passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which will become effective on January 1, 2020. We may need to alter our security and privacy practices in order to comply with CCPA, but we have not yet fully evaluated CCPA\u2019s impact on our business. It is possible that this law, and other laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, these privacy regulations may differ from state to state and country to country, and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the United States or in the local country. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nThe collection and use of personal data in the European Union is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGRPR\u201d) which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU. This expansion may incorporate our future clinical trial activities in EU members states. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for \u201csensitive information\u201d which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the EU. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer \u201cadequate\u201d privacy protections.\nOur research activities in the EU are currently limited to non-human preclinical studies, and as such, we do not collect, store, maintain, process, or transmit any Personal Data (as that term is defined under the GDPR) of trial subjects. However, since we currently have three employees located in the EU, our processing and transfer for employee Personal Data is subject to GDPR requirements. We have implemented a privacy and security program that is designed to adhere to the requirements of the GDPR in order to protect employee Personal Data, and in the event we progress to research or clinical trials involving humans, to protect participant Personal Data. However, there is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As a result, we cannot predict the impact of the GDPR regulations on our current or future business, either in the US or the EU. However, failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR (when applicable to our business) and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of global revenues, or \u20ac 20,000,000, whichever is greater. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets.\nWe assess the realizable condition of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill annually and conduct an interim evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset, indicate that these assets may be impaired. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the businesses we have acquired, which in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses into our own business. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. Such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRegulatory Risks Relating to Our Business\nChanges in health care law, regulations and policy may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing clearance or approval of our clinical laboratory services and NGS products, restrict or regulate commercial activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any products for which we obtain marketing clearance or approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or our third party collaborators, suppliers or customers may receive for any approved products.\nIn March 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, \u201cPPACA\u201d), which made a number of substantial changes in the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other things, the PPACA required each medical device manufacturer to pay a sales tax equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices, beginning in 2013. This tax may apply to some or all of our current products and products which are in development.\nSince the implementation of the PPACA, legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted, including aggregate reductions to Medicare Part B payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which became effective on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. The full impact of these laws, as well as other new laws and reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future remains uncertain, but may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, or higher production costs which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.\nMembers of the U.S. Congress and the Trump administration have expressed an intent to pass legislation or adopt executive orders to fundamentally change or repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act or to seek its invalidation through judicial action. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation to date, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a provision repealing the individual insurance coverage mandate included in the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019. On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Affordable Care Act. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and our business, are not yet known. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals may also impact our regulatory and commercial prospects, expand marketing requirements, and restrict sales and promotional activities. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the\nmarketing clearance or approval of our product candidates, if any, may be. For instance, the President also signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of provisions of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, health care providers, health insurers, and manufacturers of drugs and devices, among others, and Congress may again attempt to repeal and possibly replace parts of the ACA. We do not know whether the ACA reform efforts will be successful or what they will ultimately look like. Accordingly, at this time it is difficult to determine the full impact of these efforts on our business. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s clearance or approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing clearance or approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. Compliance with new requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens. As a result of these and other new proposals, we may need to change our current manner of operation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We expect federal and state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, increased regulatory burdens and operating costs, decreased net revenue from our testing products and clinical services, decreased potential returns from our development efforts, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any product for which we may we may gain clearance or approval. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our testing products.\nFurther, in April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) overhauling the Medicare Part B Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS). CLFS is the nationally set reimbursement rate for clinical diagnostic tests established by Section 1833(h) of the Social Security Act. In the first massive overhaul of the CLFS since it was established in 1984, PAMA mandates the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) to update the CLFS to reflect true market rates. Under PAMA and its implementing regulations, certain laboratories are required to report the amount that they are paid by third party payors for each test beginning in January 2017. CMS will use this data to calculate a weighted median for each test. For any rates that are reduced, a phase-in of the reduction will occur through 2022. Between calendar years 2018-2020 the reduction for any given test cannot exceed 10% per year, and between calendar years 2021-2022, the reduction cannot be greater than 15% per year. This data reporting process will be repeated every three years for most tests, although laboratories offering Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests (ADLTs) will have to report private payor data on those tests annually. It is possible that some of our tests may qualify as Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests, which will require us to submit pricing annually for those tests. In addition, under PAMA, we also may be required to obtain new unique codes from CMS or any entity it designates, for our tests that do not currently have unique codes. If PAMA results in a significant reduction in the prices for our tests, it could have a significant impact on our revenues and it is not known at this time how the implementation of PAMA will affect our reimbursement. We are currently working with CMS to negotiate an increased CFLS rate for our FDA-cleared test, and are exploring additional reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors.\nCertain of our laboratory services are paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and, under the current statutory formula, the rates for these services are updated annually. For the past several years, the application of the statutory formula would have resulted in substantial payment reductions if Congress failed to intervene. In the past, Congress passed interim legislation to prevent the decreases. On April 16, 2015, President Obama signed the Medicare and CHIP Reauthorization Act (\u201cMACRA\u201d), which had previously been passed by both houses of Congress. MACRA repealed the provisions related to the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula and implements a new physician payment system that is designed to reward the quality of care (\u201cQuality Payment Program\u201d). In addition, it extended the current Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rates through June 2015, and then increases them by 0.5% for the remainder of 2015. Beginning on January 1, 2016, the rates will increase annually by 0.5%, through 2019. For 2020 through 2025, payments will be frozen, although payment will be adjusted to account for performance on certain quality metrics under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment Systems (\u201cMIPS\u201d) or to reflect physician participation in alternative payment models (\u201cAPMs\u201d). For 2026 and subsequent years, qualified APM participants receive an annual 0.75% update on Medicare physician payment rates, while those not participating receive a 0.25% annual payment update, plus any applicable MIPS-based payment adjustments. At this time, it is too early to determine how these changes may impact our business beyond 2015. It is unclear what impact, if any, MACRA will have on our business and operating results, but any resulting decrease in payment may result in reduced demand for our services, which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations. CMS releases its Final Physician Fee Schedule Rule annually. The Schedule changes on a year-to-year basis, and it is difficult to predict what rates our services and tests will receive. For example, the Final Fee Schedule Rule for 2017 reduced payments for flow cytometry by approximately 19% from the 2016 rate, and increases the professional component of the immunohistochemistry by approximately 9% over the 2016 rate. In 2018, there was another reduction in rates for flow cytometry codes 88185-TC and 88189-26, with the technical side cut by 23.1% to $30.60 and the professional interpretation cut by 4.1% to $88.92. Rates for the professional component of immunohistochemistry increased again but only slightly (0.3%) to $29.87 up from $29.79 in 2017.\nOn July 12, 2018, CMS issued a proposed rule that includes proposals to update payment policies, payment rates, and quality provisions for services furnished under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) on or after January 1, 2019. CMS has proposed a change to the way Medicare Advantage payments are treated in the definition of \u201capplicable laboratory.\u201d If CMS were to finalize the proposed change, additional laboratories of all types serving a significant population of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part C could meet the majority of Medicare revenues threshold and potentially qualify as an applicable laboratory and report data to CMS. It is not clear at this time what affect this change to the definition of \u201capplicable laboratory\u201d would have, if any, on our reporting obligations or reimbursement.\nIn addition, many of the Current Procedure Terminology (\u201cCPT\u201d) procedure codes that we use to bill our tests were revised by the AMA, effective January 1, 2013. In the Final Physician Fee Schedule Rule for 2013, CMS announced that it has decided to keep the new molecular codes on the CLFS, rather than move them to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule as some stakeholders had urged. CMS also announced that for 2013 it would price the new codes using a \u201cgapfilling\u201d process by which it will refer the codes to the Medicare contractors to allow them to determine an appropriate price. Those prices were determined and became effective January 1, 2014. In addition, CMS also stated that it would not recognize certain of the new codes for Multi-Analyte Assays with Algorithmic Assays (\u201cMAAAs\u201d) because it does not believe they qualify as clinical laboratory tests. However, more recently, it has determined that the individual contractors may determine whether to pay for MAAA tests on a case by case basis. On September 25, 2015, CMS released its Preliminary Determinations for new CPT codes effective in 2016, including several new MAAA CPT codes. CMS had proposed \u201ccrosswalking\u201d these codes to an unrelated test, resulting in a significant cut in their reimbursement. However, on November 17, 2015, CMS reversed its policy and directed that the tests be gap-filled by the local contracts until 2018. For a new CDLT that is assigned a new or substantially revised HCPCS code on or after January 1, 2018, CMS determines the payment amount based on crosswalking if it is determined that a new CDLT is comparable to an existing test, multiple existing test codes, or a portion of an existing test code, or uses gap-filling if no comparable existing CDLT is available. It is expected that when PAMA is fully implemented, many of the MAAA codes could qualify to be reimbursed as Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests (\u201cADLTs\u201d), although it is unclear whether laboratories offering such tests voluntarily will apply for the ADLT designation for those tests. There can be no guarantees that Medicare and other payors will establish positive or adequate coverage policies or reimbursement rates.\nWe cannot predict whether future health care initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, or how any future legislation or regulation may affect us. The taxes imposed by the new federal legislation and the expansion of government\u2019s role in the U.S. health care industry as well as changes to the reimbursement amounts paid by payors for our products or our medical procedure volumes may reduce our profits and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, Congress has proposed on several occasions to impose a 20% coinsurance on patients for clinical laboratory tests reimbursed under the CLFS, which would require us to bill patients for these amounts. Because of the relatively low reimbursement for many clinical laboratory tests, in the event that Congress were to ever enact such legislation, the cost of billing and collecting for these services would often exceed the amount actually received from the patient and effectively increase our costs of billing and collecting.\nWe depend on Medicare and a limited number of private payors for a significant portion of our revenues and if these or other payors do not provide or stop providing reimbursement or decrease the amount of reimbursement for our tests, our revenues could decline.\nIn 2018, we derived approximately 19% of our total revenue from other third party payors, including managed care organizations and other health care insurance providers and 8% from Medicare. Medicare and other third-party payors may withdraw their coverage policies or cancel their contracts with us at any time, review and adjust the rate of reimbursement or stop paying for our tests altogether, which would reduce our total revenues.\nPayors have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. In the past, measures have been undertaken to reduce payment rates for and decrease utilization of the clinical laboratory industry generally. Because of the cost-trimming trends, third-party payors that currently cover and provide reimbursement for our tests may suspend, revoke or discontinue coverage at any time, or may reduce the reimbursement rates payable to us. Any such action could have a negative impact on our revenues, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we are currently considered a \u201cnon-contracting provider\u201d by a number of private third-party payors because we have not entered into a specific contract to provide our specialized diagnostic services to their insured patients at specified rates of reimbursement. If we were to become a contracting provider in the future, the amount of overall reimbursement we receive is likely to decrease because we will be reimbursed less money per test performed at a contracted rate than at a non-contracted rate, which could have a negative impact on our revenues. Further, we typically are unable to collect payments from patients beyond that which is paid by their insurance and will continue to experience lost revenue as a result.\nBecause of certain Medicare billing rules, we may not receive reimbursement for all tests provided to Medicare patients.\nUnder current Medicare billing rules, claims for our tests performed on Medicare beneficiaries who were hospital inpatients when the tumor tissue samples were obtained and whose tests were ordered less than 14 days from discharge must be incorporated in the payment that the hospital receives for the inpatient services provided. Accordingly, we must bill individual hospitals for tests performed on Medicare beneficiaries during these timeframes in order to receive payment for our tests. Because we generally do not have a written agreement in place with these hospitals that purchase these tests, we may not be paid for our tests or may have to pursue payment from the hospital on a case-by-case basis. In addition, until 2012, we were permitted to bill globally for certain anatomic pathology services we furnished to certain hospitals, i.e. we billed both the technical component and the professional component to Medicare. As part of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Congress terminated the special provision for \u201cgrandfathered\u201d hospitals as of July 1, 2012. Therefore, as of that date we were required to bill all hospitals for the technical component of all anatomic pathology services we furnish to their patients, which may be difficult and/or costly for us.\nFurther, the Medicare Administrative Contractors who process claims for Medicare also can impose their own rules related to coverage and payment for laboratory services provided in their jurisdiction. In 2013, Palmetto GBA, the Medicare Administrative Contractor for North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, announced a comprehensive new billing policy and a coverage policy applicable to molecular diagnostic tests, such as ours. Under coverage policy, Palmetto will deny payment for molecular diagnostic tests, unless it has issued a positive coverage determination for the test. Other Medicare contractors are also adopting policies similar to Palmetto\u2019s. If any of our tests are subject to the Palmetto policy and/or the Palmetto policy is adopted by other contractors that process claims with hospitals or laboratories that purchase and bill for our tests, our business could be adversely impacted.\nComplying with numerous regulations pertaining to our business is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.\nWe are subject to CLIA, a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. Our clinical laboratory must be certified under CLIA in order for us to perform testing on human specimens. In addition, our proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of our accredited programs under CLIA so that we can offer them in our laboratory. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. We have a current certificate under CLIA to perform high complexity testing and our laboratory is accredited by CAP, one of six CLIA-approved accreditation organizations. To renew this certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make periodic inspections of our clinical reference laboratory outside of the renewal process.\nThe law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state. Our laboratory is located in New Jersey and must have a New Jersey state license; as we expand our geographic focus, we may need to obtain laboratory licenses from additional states. New Jersey laws establish standards for day-to-day operation of our clinical reference laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. In addition, several other states require that we hold licenses to test specimens from patients in those states. For example, California is just one of several states that require out-of-state laboratories to have a state laboratory license to perform diagnostic tests on samples originating from California residents. Other states may have similar requirements or may adopt similar requirements in the future. Additionally, both New York and Washington State are exempt from CLIA and have their own stricter clinical laboratory regulatory programs. We could be required to comply with those states\u2019 programs in the event we accept specimens from New York or Washington. Finally, we may be subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions as we seek to expand international distribution of our tests.\nIf we were to lose our CLIA certification, CAP accreditation or New Jersey laboratory license, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to offer our tests, which would limit our revenues and harm our business. If we were to lose our license in other states where we are required to hold licenses, we would not be able to test specimens from those states. If we perform testing on samples originating in a state where we require a license, but do not currently have one, we could be subject to fines, sanctions, and may be denied permits or licenses in the future.\nIf the FDA were to begin requiring approval or clearance of our tests, we could incur substantial costs and time delays associated with meeting requirements for premarket clearance or approval or we could experience decreased demand for, or reimbursement of, our tests.\nAlthough FDA maintains that it has authority to regulate the development and use of LDTs, such as ours, as medical devices, it has not exercised its authority with respect to most LDTs as a matter of enforcement discretion. FDA does not generally extend its enforcement discretion to reagents or software provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs, and therefore these products must typically comply with FDA medical device regulations, which are wide-ranging and govern, among other things: product design and development, product testing, product labeling, product storage, premarket clearance or approval, advertising and promotion and product sales and distribution.\nWe believe that our proprietary tests, as utilized in our laboratory testing, are LDTs. As a result, we believe that pursuant to FDA\u2019s current policies and guidance that FDA does not require that we obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our LDTs. The container we provide for collection and transport of tumor samples from a pathology laboratory to our clinical reference laboratory may be a medical device subject to FDA\u2019s enforcement of its medical device regulations but we believe it is currently exempt from premarket review by FDA. However, our LDTs may be subject to approval by the New York State Clinical Lab Evaluation Program (\u201cCLEP\u201d). New York state\u2019s clinical laboratory regulatory program is exempt from CLIA, and maintains its own policies and procedures for evaluating and approving commercial LDTs for use in New York or on individuals residing in New York. New York LDT approval can be lengthy processes, which could delay our ability to market our tests to doctors and patients in this state. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that FDA or other regulatory agencies would agree with our determination, and a determination that we have violated these laws, or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nMoreover, FDA guidance and policy pertaining to diagnostic testing is continuing to evolve and is subject to ongoing review and revision. A significant change in any of the laws, regulations or policies may require us to change our business model in order to maintain regulatory compliance. At various times since 2006, FDA has issued guidance documents or announced draft guidance regarding initiatives that may require varying levels of FDA oversight of our tests. For example, in June 2010, FDA announced a public meeting to discuss the agency\u2019s oversight of LDTs prompted by the increased complexity of LDTs and their increasingly important role in clinical decision-making and disease management, particularly in the context of personalized medicine. FDA indicated that it was considering a risk-based application of oversight to LDTs and that, following public input and discussion, it might issue separate draft guidance on the regulation of LDTs, which ultimately could require that we seek and obtain, generally, either premarket clearance or approval of LDTs, depending upon the risk-based approach FDA adopts. The public meeting was held in July 2010 and further public comments were submitted to FDA through September 2010. Section 1143 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, signed by the U.S. President on July 9, 2012, required FDA to notify U.S. Congress at least 60 days prior to issuing a draft or final guidance regulating LDTs and provide details of the anticipated action.\nOn July 31, 2014, FDA notified Congress pursuant to the FDASIA that it intended to issue draft Guidances that would modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs and begin to enforce the applicable medical device regulations with respect to such products and tests. On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two separate draft guidances: \u201cFramework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)\u201d (\u201cThe Framework Draft Guidance\u201d) and \u201cFDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests\u201d (the \u201cNotification Draft Guidance\u201d). In the Framework Draft Guidance, FDA stated that after the Guidances are finalized, it no longer would exercise enforcement discretion with respect to most LDTs and instead would regulate them in a risk-based manner consistent with the existing classification of medical devices. The Framework Draft Guidance stated that within six months after the Guidances were finalized, all laboratories would be required to give notice to the FDA and provide basic information concerning the nature of the LDTs offered. The FDA then would begin a phased-in review of the LDTs available, based on the risk associated with the tests. For the highest risk LDTs, which the FDA classifies as Class III devices, the Framework Draft Guidance stated that the FDA would begin to require premarket review within 12 months after the Guidance was finalized. Other high risk LDTs would be reviewed over the next four years and then lower risk tests (Class II tests) would be reviewed in the following four to nine years. The Framework Draft Guidance stated that FDA expected to issue a separate Guidance describing the criteria for its risk-based classification 18-24 months after the Guidances were finalized.\nOn November 18, 2016, the FDA stated that it would not be issuing final guidance on regulation of LDTs and, instead, it would outline its view of an appropriate risk-based approach to LDTs. On January 13, 2017, the FDA released a \u201cDiscussion Paper on Laboratory Developed Tests\u201d that synthesizes the feedback that the agency received from various stakeholders on FDA regulation of LDTs \u201cwith the hope that it advances public discussion on LDT oversight.\u201d The FDA stated in the introduction to the discussion paper: \u201cThe synthesis does not represent the formal thinking of the FDA, nor is it enforceable\u2026This document does not represent a final version of the LDT draft guidance documents that were published in 2014.\u201d Rather, its purpose is to allow for further public discussion and to give Congress a chance to develop a legislative solution. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has stated publicly that it would be preferable for Congress to develop a clear legislative framework for the FDA to implement, rather than for the FDA to regulate LDTs through guidance documents. A number of Congressional committees of\nthe 115th Congress reportedly are working with various stakeholders to consider different approaches to regulation of LDTs. On August 3, 2018, FDA provided Congressional committee staff technical assistance on the discussion draft entitled the Diagnostic Accuracy and Innovation Act (DAIA). In FDA\u2019s technical assistance, FDA reiterated that it supported the goal of legislation to create pathways to market for all in vitro clinical tests (IVCTs). It is unclear at this time whether those committees and stakeholders can reach consensus around an approach and develop legislation and whether Congress would pass any such legislation.\nIf the FDA regulates LDTs as proposed, then it would likely classify LDTs according to the current system used to regulate medical devices. Under that system, there are three different classes of medical devices, with the requirements becoming more stringent depending on the Class.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including premarket review, will not be required in the future for our tests, whether through guidance issued by FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. We believe it is possible that legislation will be enacted into law or guidance could be issued by FDA, which may result in increased regulatory burdens for us to continue to offer our tests or to develop and introduce new tests. Given the attention Congress continues to give to these issues, legislation affecting this area may be enacted into law and may result in increased regulatory burdens on us as we continue to offer our tests and to develop and introduce new tests.\nIn addition, the former Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services requested that its Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society make recommendations about the oversight of genetic testing. A final report was published in April 2008. If the report\u2019s recommendations for increased oversight of genetic testing were to result in further regulatory burdens, they could negatively affect our business and delay the commercialization of tests in development.\nAn FDA requirement that LDTs undergo premarket review could negatively affect our business until such review is completed and clearance or approval to market is obtained. FDA could require that we stop selling our tests pending premarket clearance or approval. If FDA allows our tests to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about our tests, if they are labeled investigational by FDA or if labeling claims FDA allows us to make are very limited, orders or reimbursement may decline. The regulatory approval process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and making a 510(k) submission, or filing a PMA application with FDA. If FDA requires premarket review, our tests may not be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all. We may also decide voluntarily to pursue FDA premarket review of our tests if we determine that doing so would be appropriate.\nAdditionally, should future regulatory actions affect any of the reagents we obtain from vendors and use in conducting our tests, our business could be adversely affected in the form of increased costs of testing or delays, limits or prohibitions on the purchase of reagents necessary to perform our testing.\nIf we were required to conduct additional clinical trials prior to continuing to offer our proprietary tests or any other tests that we may develop as LDTs, those trials could lead to delays or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approval, which could cause significant delays in commercializing any future products and harm our ability to achieve sustained profitability.\nIf the FDA decides to require that we obtain clearance or approvals to commercialize our proprietary tests, we may be required to conduct additional clinical testing prior to submitting a marketing application (e.g., 510(k) premarket notification or PMA application) for commercial sales. In addition, as part of our long-term strategy we plan to seek FDA clearance or approval so we can sell our proprietary tests outside our laboratory; however, we need to conduct additional clinical validation activities on our proprietary tests, including reproducibility between labs, before we can submit an application for FDA approval or clearance. If the supply of reagents or equipment on which our tests in development or commercial tests rely becomes unavailable and we have to source replacement reagents or equipment for our tests, additional validation activities will be required and we may need to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for the modified tests.\nAdditionally, if we commercialize any of our lab developed tests, we may also be required to submit such tests for approval by the New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations or FDA may take enforcement action or reject the data. The data collected from these clinical trials may ultimately be used to support clearance or approval for our tests. Once commenced, we believe it would likely take two years or more to conduct the studies and trials necessary to obtain clearance or approval from FDA to commercially launch any of our proprietary tests outside of our clinical laboratory. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our test claims or that FDA or foreign authorities will agree with our conclusions regarding our test results. Success in early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and studies. If we are required to conduct clinical trials, whether using\nprospectively acquired samples or archival samples, delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly increase our test development costs, delay commercialization, and interrupt sales of our current products and tests. Many of the factors that may cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or approval. The commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. Moreover, the clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our tests are effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a test candidate and may delay development of other tests.\nWe may find it necessary to engage contract research organizations to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our clinical trials, which might increase the cost and complexity of our trials. We may also depend on clinical investigators, medical institutions and contract research organizations to perform the trials properly. If these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our clinical trials may have to be extended, delayed or terminated. Many of these factors would be beyond our control. We may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or considerable expenditures. If there are delays in testing or approvals as a result of the failure to perform by third parties, our research and development costs would increase, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our tests. In addition, we may not be able to establish or maintain relationships with these parties on favorable terms, if at all. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our tests or to achieve sustained profitability.\nWe are subject to federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\nHealthcare providers, physicians, and others will play a primary role in the ordering of our testing products and clinical services. Our arrangements with such persons and third-party payors, including price reporting obligations imposed by federal health care programs, will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell, and distribute our tests, if we require or obtain marketing approval. Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or directly bill to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws, and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and to patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. We are subject to health care fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. These health care laws and regulations include, for example:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or to reward inducement either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or lease, order or recommendation of, any item, good, facility or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term \u2018\u2018remuneration\u2019\u2019 has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of \u201cdesignated health services\u201d (including clinical laboratory services) with whom the physician or a member of the physician\u2019s immediate family has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless a statutory or regulatory exception applies;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which established federal crimes for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services;\n\u2022\nthe beneficiary inducement provision of the federal civil monetary penalties law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration, including waivers of co-payments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u2022\nthe civil monetary penalties statute also imposes fines against any person who is determined to have knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nfederal civil False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay money to the federal government; and knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal\ngovernment. Any demand for payment, such as an invoice, that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nthe criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.\nFurther, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes.\nThe PPACA, among other things, also imposed new reporting requirements on manufacturers of certain devices, drugs and biologics for certain payments and transfers of value by them and in some cases their distributors to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act (Section 6002 of the PPACA) states that failure to submit required information timely, completely and accurately for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d). Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Any failure to comply with these reporting requirements could result in significant fines and penalties. Because we manufacture our own LDTs solely for use by or within our own laboratory, we believe that we are exempt from these reporting requirements. We cannot assure you, however, that the government will agree with our determination, and a determination that we have violated these laws and regulations, or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nEnsuring that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations were found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracting and refusal of orders under existing contracts, and exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations. If the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nWe have adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws, including policies and procedures relating to financial arrangements between us and physicians who refer patients to us. In the ordinary course of our business, we conduct internal reviews of our compliance with these laws. Our compliance is also subject to governmental review. The government alleged that we engaged in improper billing practices in the past and we may be the subject of such allegations in the future as the growth of our business and sales organization may increase the potential of violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations.\nAny action brought against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medi-Cal or other state or federal health care programs, we could be required to refund payments received by us, and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.\nWe are required to comply with laws governing the transmission, security and privacy of health information that require significant compliance costs, and any failure to comply with these laws could result in material criminal and civil penalties.\nUnder the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations which establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and\nprotecting the privacy and security of Protected Health Information used or disclosed by health care providers and other covered entities. Three principal regulations with which we are currently required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA: privacy regulations, security regulations and standards for electronic transactions.\nThe privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (\u201cPHI\u201d) by \u201ccovered entities,\u201d which includes health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and health care providers who electronically transmit any health information in connection with transactions for which HHS has adopted standards. It also sets forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PPHI maintained by a covered entity, including the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. We have implemented policies, procedures and standards in an effort to comply appropriately with the final HIPAA security regulations, which establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability PHI, which is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal \u201cfloor\u201d and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing Protected Health Information. As a result, we are required to comply with both HIPAA privacy regulations and varying state privacy and security laws, which may be more stringent than HIPAA. Moreover, HITECH, among other things, established certain health information security breach notification requirements. Under HIPAA, a covered entity must notify any individual \u201cwithout unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach\u201d if their unsecured Protected Health Information is subject to an unauthorized access, use or disclosure. If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported to HHS and local media without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website. If a breach affects fewer than 500 individuals, the covered entity must log it and notify HHS at least annually.\nCertain state laws may also affect our other privacy and security practices. For example, California recently passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which will become effective on January 1, 2020. Although HIPAA-protected information is exempt from CCPA, additional information we may maintain on our customers and employees may be subject to additional security and privacy protections. Other states have specific protections for certain types of information. We may need to alter our security and privacy practices in order to comply with CCPA, but we have not yet fully evaluated CCPA\u2019s impact on our business.\nHIPAA contains significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of Protected Health Information. We have implemented practices and procedures to meet the requirements of the HIPAA privacy regulations and state privacy laws. In addition, we have taken commercially reasonable and industry standard steps to comply with HIPAA\u2019s standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common health care transactions. Given the complexity of the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy restrictions, the possibility that the regulations may change, and the fact that the regulations are subject to changing and potentially conflicting interpretation, our ability to comply with the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy requirements is uncertain and the costs of compliance are significant. To the extent that we submit electronic health care claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and HITECH, payments to us may be delayed or denied. Additionally, the costs of complying with any changes to the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy restrictions may have a negative impact on our operations. We could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions for failing to comply with the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy restrictions, which could result in the incurrence of significant monetary penalties. For further discussion of HIPAA and the impact on our business, see the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy-Security breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to fines, penalties, liability, and adverse effects to our business and our reputation.\u201d\nOur operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, with which compliance may be costly.\nOur business is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, worker health and safety and the use, management, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. In addition, environmental laws and regulations could require us to pay for environmental remediation and response costs, or subject us to third party claims for personal injury, natural resource or property damage, relating to environmental contamination. Liability may be imposed whether or not we knew of, or were responsible for, such environmental contamination. The cost of defending against environmental claims, of compliance with environmental, health and safety regulatory requirements or of remediating contamination could materially adversely affect our business, assets or results of operations.\nIntellectual Property Risks Relating to Our Business\nOur rights to use technologies licensed from third parties are not within our control, and we may not be able to sell our products if we lose our existing rights or cannot obtain new rights on reasonable terms.\nOur ability to market certain of our tests and services, domestically and/or internationally, is in part derived from licenses to intellectual property which is owned by third parties. As such, we may not be able to continue selling our tests and services if we lose our existing licensed rights or sell new tests and services if we cannot obtain such licensed rights on reasonable terms. In particular, we currently in-license a biomarker from the National Cancer Institute used in our FHACT probe. Further, we may also need to license other technologies to commercialize future products. As may be expected, our business may suffer if (i) these licenses terminate; (ii) if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, properly maintain the licensed intellectual property or fail to prevent infringement of such intellectual property by third parties; (iii) if the licensed patents or other intellectual property rights are found to be invalid or (iv) if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all. In return for the use of a third-party\u2019s technology, we may agree to pay the licensor royalties based on sales of our products as well as other fees. Such royalties and fees are a component of cost of product revenues and will impact the margins on our tests.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to inventions we develop from our use of the biological materials they provide to us.\nWe rely on certain third parties to provide us with tissue samples and biological materials that we use to develop our tests. In some cases we have written agreements with third parties that may require us to negotiate ownership and commercial rights with the third party if our use of such third party\u2019s materials results in an invention. Other agreements may limit our use of those materials to research/not for profit use. In other cases, we may not have written agreements, or the written agreements we have may not clearly deal with intellectual property rights. If we cannot successfully negotiate sufficient ownership and commercial rights to the inventions that result from our use of a third party supplier\u2019s materials where required, or if disputes otherwise arise with respect to the intellectual property developed with the use of a third party\u2019s samples, we may be limited in our ability to capitalize on the market potential of these inventions.\nThe U.S. government may have \u201cmarch-in rights\u201d to certain of our probe related intellectual property.\nBecause federal grant monies were used in support of the research and development activities that resulted in our two issued U.S. patents, the federal government retains what are referred to as \u201cmarch-in rights\u201d to these patents. In particular, the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Health, each of which administered grant monies to us, technically retain the right to require us, under certain specific circumstances, to grant the U.S. government either a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license to the patented invention in any field of use, upon terms that are reasonable for a particular situation. Circumstances that trigger march-in rights include, for example, failure to take, within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention in a field of use, failure to satisfy the health and safety needs of the public, and failure to meet requirements of public use specified by federal regulations. The National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Health can elect to exercise these march-in rights on their own initiative or at the request of a third-party.\nIf we are unable to maintain intellectual property protection, our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur ability to protect our proprietary discoveries and technologies affects our ability to compete and to achieve sustained profitability. Currently, we rely on a combination of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications, copyrights, trademarks and trademark applications, confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements, material transfer agreements, licenses, work-for-hire agreements and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also maintain as trade secrets certain company know-how and technological innovations designed to provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Currently, including both U.S. and foreign patent applications, we have only two issued U.S. patents and twelve pending patent applications relating to various aspects of our technology. While we intend to pursue additional patent applications, it is possible that our pending patent applications and any future applications may not result in issued patents. Even if patents are issued, third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids our patents. Further, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our trade secrets and other confidential information and technology, particularly in foreign countries where we do not have intellectual property rights.\nFrom time to time the U.S. Supreme Court, other federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) may change the standards of patentability. Any such changes could have a negative impact on our business. For instance, on October 30, 2008, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision that methods or processes cannot be patented unless they are tied to a machine or involve a physical transformation. The U.S. Supreme Court later reversed that decision in Bilski v. Kappos, finding that the \u201cmachine-or-transformation\u201d test is not the only test for determining patent eligibility. The Court, however, declined to specify how and when processes are patentable. Most recently, on March 20, 2012, in the case Mayo v. Prometheus, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit\u2019s application of Bilski and invalidated a patent focused on a diagnostic process because the patent claim embodied a law of nature. On July 3, 2012, the USPTO issued\nits Interim Guidelines for Subject Matter Eligibility Analysis of Process Claims Involving Laws of Nature in view of the Prometheus decision. It remains to be seen how these guidelines play out in the actual prosecution of diagnostic claims. Similarly, it remains to be seen lower courts will interpret the Prometheus decision. Some aspects of our technology involve processes that may be subject to this evolving standard, and we cannot guarantee that any of our pending process claims will be patentable as a result of such evolving standards.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June 14, 2013 decision in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad will likely have an impact on the entire biotechnology industry. Specifically, the case involved certain of Myriad Genetics, Inc.\u2019s U.S. patents related to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Plaintiffs asserted that the breast cancer genes were not patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court unanimously held that the isolated form of naturally occurring DNA molecules does not rise to the level of patent-eligible subject matter. But the Court also held that claims directed to complementary DNA (cDNA) molecules were patent-eligible because cDNA is not naturally occurring. The Supreme Court focused on the informational content of the isolated DNA and determined that the information contained in the isolated DNA molecule was not markedly different from that naturally found in the human chromosome. Yet, in holding isolated cDNA molecules patent-eligible, the Court recognized the differences between human chromosomal DNA and the corresponding cDNA. Because the non-coding regions of naturally occurring chromosomal DNA have been removed in cDNA, the Court accepted that cDNA is not a product of nature and, therefore, is patent-eligible subject matter.\nIt does not appear that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Myriad will adversely affect our current patent portfolio which, unlike the claims at issue in Myriad, centers on algorithmic methods associating chromosomal markers to specific clinical end-points. Nevertheless, we of course need to remain mindful that this is an evolving area of law.\nIn addition, on February 5, 2010, the Secretary\u2019s Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society voted to approve a report entitled \u201cGene Patents and Licensing Practices and Their Impact on Patient Access to Genetic Tests.\u201d That report defines \u201cpatent claims on genes\u201d broadly to include claims to isolated nucleic acid molecules as well as methods of detecting particular sequences or mutations. The report also contains six recommendations, including the creation of an exemption from liability for infringement of patent claims on genes for anyone making, using, ordering, offering for sale or selling a test developed under the patent for patient care purposes, or for anyone using the patent-protected genes in the pursuit of research. The report also recommended that the Secretary should explore, identify and implement mechanisms that will encourage more voluntary adherence to current guidelines that promote nonexclusive in-licensing of diagnostic genetic and genomic technologies. It is unclear whether the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will act upon these recommendations, or if the recommendations would result in a change in law or process that could negatively impact our patent portfolio or future research and development efforts.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, which could be time-consuming and costly to defend, and could result in our loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.\nFrom time to time we may face intellectual property infringement (or misappropriation) claims from third parties. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. The outcome of any such litigation can never be guaranteed, and an adverse outcome could affect us negatively. For example, were a third-party to succeed on an infringement claim against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages (including up to treble damages if such infringement were found to be willful). In addition, we could face an injunction, barring us from conducting the allegedly infringing activity. The outcome of the litigation could require us to enter into a license agreement which may not be pursuant to acceptable or commercially reasonable or practical terms or which may not be available at all. It is also possible that an adverse finding of infringement against us may require us to dedicate substantial resources and time in developing non-infringing alternatives, which may or may not be possible. In the case of diagnostic tests, we would also need to include non-infringing technologies which would require us to re-validate our tests. Any such re-validation, in addition to being costly and time consuming, may be unsuccessful.\nFurthermore, we may initiate claims to assert or defend our own intellectual property against third parties. Any intellectual property litigation, irrespective of whether we are the plaintiff or the defendant, and regardless of the outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert our management\u2019s attention from our business and negatively affect our operating results or financial condition. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our third party collaborators or suppliers, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, interference proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents and patent applications or those of our current or future collaborators, suppliers or customers.\nFinally, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential and proprietary information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of\nlitigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our technologies in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States. These products may compete with our technologies in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Relating to Our International Operations\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nOur business strategy incorporates international expansion, including our recent acquisitions which have provided us with facilities in Australia, and the possibility of establishing and maintaining clinician marketing and education capabilities in other locations outside of the United States and expanding our relationships with distributors and manufacturers. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax and transfer pricing laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022\nbeing subject to additional privacy and cybersecurity laws, including the Australian Privacy Act of 1988;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our distributors to obtain regulatory approvals for the sale or use of our tests in various countries, including failure to achieve \u201cCE Marking\u201d, a conformity mark which is required to market in vitro diagnostic medical devices in the European Economic Area and which is broadly accepted in other international markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payor-reimbursement regimes or self-pay systems;\n\u2022\nlogistics and regulations associated with shipping tissue samples, including infrastructure conditions and transportation delays;\n\u2022\nlimits on our ability to penetrate international markets if our diagnostic tests cannot be processed by an appropriately qualified local laboratory;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, by maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 activities.\nAny of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on the deployment of cash across our global operations.\nAlthough we report our operating results in U.S. dollars, a portion of our revenues and expenses are or will be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues, income from operations, other income (expense), net and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies. There is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which could limit our ability to use these funds across our global operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe FCPA and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties, including criminal and civil fines, potential loss of export licenses, possible suspension of the ability to do business with the federal government, denial of government reimbursement for products and exclusion from participation in government health care programs. We may operate in jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. We cannot assure that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and could remain volatile, and the market price of our common stock may decrease.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. From January 2015 through December 31, 2018, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated from a high of $12.75 per share in the third quarter of 2015, to a low of $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Market prices for securities of development-stage life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. The factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nprogress, or lack of progress, in developing and commercializing our proprietary tests;\n\u2022\nfavorable or unfavorable decisions about our tests or services from government regulators, insurance companies or other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit and retain qualified regulatory and research and development personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in our relationship with key collaborators, suppliers, customers and third parties;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuation or earnings of our competitors or companies viewed as similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u2022\ndepth of the trading market in our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe granting or exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards;\n\u2022\nrealization of any of the risks described under this section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the equity markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the securities of newly public companies for a number of reasons, including reasons that may be unrelated to our business or operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock and you may not be able to sell your shares at prices you deem acceptable. In the past, following periods of volatility in the equity markets, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against public companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management attention.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our common stock price and trading volume.\nSecurities research analysts establish and publish their own periodic projections for our business. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match securities research analysts\u2019 projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who writes reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline. While we expect securities research analyst coverage, if no securities or industry analysts begin to cover us, the trading price for our stock and the trading volume could be adversely affected.\nOur directors and executive officers have substantial influence over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nOur directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates, in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 15.2% of our outstanding common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding on March 27, 2019. These stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over our management and affairs. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control;\n\u2022\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are incurring significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, in addition to being required to comply with certain requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to comply with certain requirements of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. We expect that compliance with these requirements will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will continue to need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, if we lose our status as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we will be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as applicable, requires us to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to continue to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and maintain compliance with Section 404, as applicable, requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. We expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause our operations to suffer and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from our auditors as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for our common stock, and could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current members of our board and management.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approoval, preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors and that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that our board of directors does not approve;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nlimit who may call a stockholder meeting.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of the voting rights on our common stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.\nBecause we do not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future, you must rely on appreciation of our common stock price for any return on your investment. Even if we change that policy, we may be restricted from paying dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial performance, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, you will have to rely on capital appreciation, if any, to earn a return on your investment in our common stock. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur ability to utilize our federal net operating loss, carryforwards and federal tax credits are limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The limitations apply since we have experienced an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined by Section 382, as a result of the Company\u2019s securities offerings. Generally, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of the value of the stock that is owned by one or more direct or indirect \u201cfive percent shareholders\u201d changes by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage at any time during the applicable testing period (typically three years). Since we have experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d, our NOL carryforwards and federal tax credits are subject to limitations as to our ability to utilize them to offset taxable income and related income taxes. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger further \u201cownership changes\u201d which would further limit their utilization. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset United States federal taxable income and related income taxes are subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.", "PERMNO": 14094, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "CGIX"}
