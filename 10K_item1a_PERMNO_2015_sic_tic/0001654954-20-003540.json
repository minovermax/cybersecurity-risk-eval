RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this document. Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nA.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nA1.\nManagement has determined that there is, and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement has determined that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to defaults under our secured loan agreements, historic net losses, and working capital deficits. A \u2018going concern\u2019 opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurring debt, or other financing alternatives. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on sustained positive operating margins and working capital to sustain operations, including the purchase of crude oil and condensate and payments on long-term debt. If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would be jeopardized, and we may not be able to continue. If we are unable to make required debt payments, we would likely have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, cutting costs or otherwise reducing our cash requirements, or negotiating with our creditors to restructure our applicable obligations.\nA2.\nInadequate liquidity to sustain operations due to defaults under our secured loan agreements, historic net losses, and working capital deficits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe currently rely on revenue from operations, Affiliates, and borrowings under bank facilities to meet our liquidity needs. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to acquisition of crude oil and condensate to operate the Nixon refinery, repayment of short-term debt obligations, and capital expenditures for maintenance, upgrades, and refurbishment of equipment at the Nixon facility. Our long-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of long-term debt obligations. In addition, we continue to utilize capital to reduce operational, safety and environmental risks. We may incur substantial compliance costs relating to any new environmental, health and safety regulations. The Amended Pilot Line of Credit will mature in May 2020. Our liquidity will affect our ability to satisfy any of these needs.\nWe had a working capital deficit of $59.4 million and $71.9 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding the current portion of long-term debt, we had a working capital deficit of $19.6 million and $30.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (current portion) of $0.07 million and $0.05 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Comparatively, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (current portion) of $0.01 million and $0.05 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018.\nWhile we believe that we can fund our operations through revenue from operations and Affiliate financing, we may not be able to, among other things, (i) maintain our current general and administrative spending levels; (ii) fund certain obligations as they become due; and (iii) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements. We cannot provide any assurance that financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms.\nA3.\nDefaults under our secured loan agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and materially adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nAs described elsewhere in this report, we are in default under our secured loan agreements. Defaults include events of default and financial covenant violations. Defaults under our secured loan agreements permit Veritex to declare the amounts owed under these loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise its rights with respect to collateral securing obligors\u2019 obligations under these loan agreements, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available. The debt associated with these loans was classified within the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nIn September 2017, Veritex notified obligors of events of default, including, but not limited to, the occurrence of the GEL Final Arbitration Award, associated material adverse effect conditions, failure by LE to replenish a $1.0 million payment reserve account, and the occurrence of events of default by obligors under our other secured loan agreements with Veritex, all of which constituted events of default under our secured loan agreements. Further, Veritex informed obligors that it would consider a final confirmation of the GEL Final Arbitration Award to be a material event of default under the loan agreements. Veritex did not accelerate or call due our secured loan agreements considering these factors. Instead, Veritex expressly reserved all its rights, privileges and remedies related to events of default.\nIn April 2019, obligors were notified by Veritex that the bank agreed to waive certain covenant defaults and forbear from enforcing its remedies under our secured loan agreements subject to: (i) the agreement and concurrence of the USDA and (ii) the replenishment of the payment reserve account on or before August 31, 2019. Following the GEL Settlement, the associated mutual releases became effective and GEL filed a stipulation of dismissal of claims against LE. As of the date of this report, LE had not replenished the payment reserve account and obligors were still in default under our secured loan agreements with Veritex.\nAt December 31, 2019, LE and LRM were in violation of the debt service coverage ratio, current ratio, and debt to net worth ratio financial covenants under our secured loan agreements with Veritex.\nAny exercise by Veritex of its rights and remedies under our secured loan agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business operations, including crude oil and condensate procurement and our customer relationships; financial condition; and results of operations. In such a case, the trading price of our common stock and the value of an investment in our common stock could significantly decrease, which could lead to holders of our common stock losing their investment in our common stock in its entirety.\nWe can provide no assurance that: (i) our assets or cash flow will be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under outstanding long-term debt, either upon maturity or if accelerated, (ii) LE and LRM will be able to refinance or restructure the payments on the long-term debt, and/or (iii) Veritex, as first lien holder, will provide future default waivers. Defaults under our secured loan agreements and any exercise by Veritex of its rights and remedies related to such defaults may have a material adverse effect on the trading prices of our common stock and on the value of an investment in our common stock, and holders of our common stock could lose their investment in our common stock in its entirety.\nA4.\nWe will need to repay or refinance borrowings under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit.\nThe Amended Pilot Line of Credit is scheduled to mature in May 2020. We will need to repay, refinance, replace or otherwise extend the maturity of this line of credit. Our ability to repay, refinance, replace or extend this facility by its maturity date will be dependent on, among other things, business conditions, our financial performance and the general condition of the financial markets. If a financial disruption were to occur at the time that we are required to repay this indebtedness, we could be forced to undertake alternate financings, including a sale of additional common stock, negotiate for an extension of the maturity or sell assets and delay capital expenditures in order to generate proceeds that could be used to repay such indebtedness. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to consummate any such transaction on terms that are commercially reasonable, on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nA5.\nOur substantial current debt, which is included in the current portion of long-term debt (in default), the current portion of long-term debt, related party (in default), and line of credit payable, could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had current debt of $51.3 million and $41.9 million, respectively, consisting of bank debt, related party debt, and a line of credit payable. Blue Dolphin, as parent company, has guaranteed the indebtedness of certain subsidiaries. In addition, Affiliates have guaranteed the indebtedness of Blue Dolphin and certain of its subsidiaries. This level of debt in current liabilities and the cross guarantee agreements could have important consequences, such as: (i) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or potential growth, or for other purposes; (ii) increasing the cost of future borrowings; (iii) limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt; (iv) placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt; and (v) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nAs of the filing date of this report, we were current with the monthly payments required under our bank debt and line of credit payable. Our ability to service our debt is dependent upon, among other things, business conditions, our financial and operating performance, our ability to raise capital, and regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our working capital is not sufficient to service our debt, and any future indebtedness that we incur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nA6.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit.\nAdverse changes to the availability, terms and cost of capital, interest rates or our credit ratings (which would have a corresponding impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries that are party to any cross-guarantee agreements) could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital, including our ability to refinance maturing or accelerated existing indebtedness on similar terms. As a result, we cannot provide any assurance that any financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all. Any such financing could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms, we may further reduce our expenses and we may not be able to, among other things, (i) maintain our general and administrative expenses at current levels; (ii) successfully implement our business strategy; (iii) fund certain obligations as they become due; (iv) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements; or (v) repay our indebtedness. Based on the historical negative cash flows and the continued limited cash inflows in the period subsequent to year end there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nA7.\nAffiliates hold a significant ownership interest in us and exert significant influence over us, and their interests may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders; Affiliate transactions may cause conflicts of interest that may adversely affect us.\nAffiliates control approximately 82% of the voting power of our Common Stock and, by virtue of such stock ownership, can control or exert substantial influence over us, including:\n\u25cf\nElection and appointment of directors;\n\u25cf\nBusiness strategy and policies;\n\u25cf\nMergers and other business combinations;\n\u25cf\nAcquisition or disposition of assets;\n\u25cf\nFuture issuances of Common Stock or other securities; and\n\u25cf\nIncurrence of debt or obtaining other sources of financing.\nThe existence of a controlling stockholder may have the effect of making it difficult for, or may discourage or delay, a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of our outstanding Common Stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nAffiliate interest may not always be consistent with our interests or with the interests of our other stockholders. Affiliates may also pursue acquisitions or business opportunities in industries in which we compete, and there is no requirement that any additional business opportunities be presented to us. We also have and may in the future enter transactions to purchase goods or services with Affiliates. To the extent that conflicts of interest may arise between us and Affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manner adverse to us or its other stockholders.\nThese relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our Board is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Affiliates. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter new relationships in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business.\nA8.\nThe dangers inherent in oil and gas operations could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities and reduce our liquidity.\nOil and gas operations are inherently subject to significant hazards and risks. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions, ruptures, blowouts, spills, third-party interference and equipment failure, any of which could result in interruption or termination of operations, pollution, personal injury and death, or damage to our assets and the property of others. These risks could result in substantial losses to us from injury and loss of life, damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations. Offshore operations are also subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment, such as hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions and more extensive governmental regulation. These regulations may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for pollution damage or result in the interruption or termination of operations. These risks could harm our reputation and business, result in claims against us, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA9.\nThe geographic concentration of our assets creates a significant exposure to the risks of the regional economy and other regional adverse conditions.\nOur primary operating assets are in Nixon, Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale, and we market our refined products in a single, relatively limited geographic area. In addition, we have facilities and related onshore pipeline assets in Freeport, Texas, and offshore pipelines and oil and gas properties are in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, our operations are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than our more geographically diversified competitors. Any changes in market conditions, unforeseen circumstances, or other events affecting the area in which our assets are located could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These factors include, among other things, changes in the economy, weather conditions, demographics, and population.\nA10.\nCompetition from companies having greater financial and other resources could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe refining industry is highly competitive. Our refining operations compete with domestic refiners and marketers in PADD 3 (Gulf Coast), domestic refiners in other PADD regions, and foreign refiners that import products into the U.S. Certain of our competitors have larger, more complex refineries and may be able to realize higher margins per barrel of product produced. Several of our principal competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do and have access to proprietary sources of controlled crude oil production. Unlike these competitors, we obtain all our feedstocks from a single supplier. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, larger, more complex refineries may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as crude oil and other feedstocks supply shortages or commodity price fluctuations. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose existing customers or fail to acquire new customers.\nA11.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remain in compliance or to remediate current or future contamination that could give rise to material liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the environment, product specifications and the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and remediation of solid and hazardous wastes. Violations of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial penalties, injunctive orders compelling installation of additional controls, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns.\nIn addition, new environmental laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement of laws and regulations, or other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. The requirements to be met, as well as the technology and length of time available to meet those requirements, continue to develop and change. Expenditures or costs for environmental compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and profitability.\nThe Nixon facility operates under several federal and state permits, licenses, and approvals with terms and conditions that contain a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards. These permits, licenses, approvals, limits, and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval, limit or standard. Non-compliance or incomplete documentation of our compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. Additionally, there may be times when we are unable to meet the standards and terms and conditions of our permits, licenses and approvals due to operational upsets or malfunctions, which may lead to the imposition of fines and penalties or operating restrictions that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our facilities, and accordingly our financial performance.\nA12.\nWe are subject to strict laws and regulations regarding personnel and process safety, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability.\nWe are subject to the requirements of OSHA, SEMS, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection, health, and safety of workers, and the proper design, operation and maintenance of our equipment. In addition, OSHA and certain other environmental regulations require that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to personnel and state and local governmental authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, may result in significant fines or compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA13.\nOur insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs, or liabilities that we may experience, and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums.\nOur insurance program may not cover all operational risks and costs and may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim. We do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses and could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in the insurance markets subsequent to certain hurricanes and natural disasters have made it more difficult and more expensive to obtain certain types of coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance, or failure by one or more of our insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Insurance companies may reduce the insurance capacity they are willing to offer or may demand significantly higher premiums or deductibles to cover our assets. If significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the energy industry occur, we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost. There is no assurance that our insurers will renew their insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of non-renewal. The unavailability of full insurance coverage to cover events in which we suffer significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA14.\nOur ability to use NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.\nUnder IRC Section 382, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Within the meaning of IRC Section 382, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs when the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders, applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nBlue Dolphin experienced ownership changes in 2005 because of a series of private placements, and in 2012 because of a reverse acquisition. The 2012 ownership change limits our ability to utilize NOLs following the 2005 ownership change that were not previously subject to limitation. Limitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect, and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. NOLs generated after the 2012 ownership change are not subject to limitation. If the IRS were to challenge our NOLs in an audit, we cannot assure that we would prevail against such challenge. If the IRS were successful in challenging our NOLs, all or some portion of our NOLs would not be available to offset any future consolidated income, which would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in 2017, may also limit our ability to utilize our net operating tax loss carryforwards.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, management determined that cumulative losses incurred over the prior three-year period provided significant objective evidence that limited the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as projections for future growth. Based on this evaluation, we recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nA15.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or development new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. We may not be able to respond do these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA16.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our production and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers\u2019 operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nA17.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats.\nA cyberattack or similar incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, damage to our reputation or financial loss. Our industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production, processing and financial activities. Our technologies, systems, networks, or other proprietary information, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or could otherwise lead to the disruption of our business operations. Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period and could lead to disruptions in critical systems or the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information. These events could lead to financial loss from remedial actions, loss of business, disruption of operations, damage to our reputation or potential liability. Also, computers control nearly all the oil and gas distribution systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transportation our production to market. A cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Cyber incidents have increased, and the United States government has issued warnings indicating that energy assets may be specific targets of cybersecurity threats. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. Further, as cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyberattacks.\nA18.\nWe face various risks associated with increase activism against oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.\nOpposition toward oil and natural gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the United States. Companies in the oil and natural gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain operations such as drilling and development.\nA19.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, or an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business will be dependent upon the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct transactions. The spread of a highly infectious or contagious disease, such as COVID-19, could cause severe disruptions in the worldwide economy, which could in turn disrupt our business, activities, and operations, as well as that of our customers. Moreover, since the beginning of January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States. The spread of COVID-19, or an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, may result in a significant decrease in business and/or cause customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations. A spread of COVID-19, or an outbreak of another contagious disease, could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business. Such a spread or outbreak could also negatively impact the business and operations of third-party providers who perform critical services for our business. If COVID-19, or another highly infectious or contagious disease, spreads or the response to contain COVID-19 is unsuccessful, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nB.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nB1.\nRefining margins are volatile, and a reduction in refining margins will adversely affect the amount of cash we will have available for working capital.\nHistorically, refining margins have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between our refined product sales prices and our crude oil and condensate costs. Our crude oil and condensate acquisition costs and the prices at which we can ultimately sell our refined products depend upon numerous factors beyond our control. The prices at which we sell refined products are strongly influenced by the commodity price of crude oil. If crude oil prices increase, our \u2018refinery operations\u2019 business segment margins will fall unless we can pass along these price increases to our wholesale customers. Increases in the selling prices for refined products typically trail the rising cost of crude oil and may be difficult to implement when crude oil costs increase dramatically over a short period.\nB2.\nThe price volatility of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products, and fuel and utility services may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur refining earnings, cash flows and liquidity from operations depend primarily on the margin above operating expenses (including the cost of refinery feedstocks, such as crude oil and condensate that are processed and blended into refined products) at which we can sell refined products. Crude oil refining is primarily a margin-based business. To improve margins, it is important for a crude oil refinery to maximize the yields of high value finished petroleum produces and to minimize the costs of feedstocks and operating expenses. When the margin between refined product prices and crude oil and other feedstock costs decreases, our margins are negatively affected. Crude oil refining margins have historically been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile, because of a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products, and fuel and utility services. Although an increase or decrease in the price for crude oil generally results in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products, typically there is a time lag between the comparable increase or decrease in prices for refined products. The effect of changes in crude oil and condensate prices on our refining margins therefore depends, in part, on how quickly and how fully refined product prices adjust to reflect these changes.\nPrices of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, other feedstocks, and refined products. Such supply and demand are affected by, among other things:\n\u25cf\nchanges in foreign, domestic, and local economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nforeign and domestic demand for fuel products;\n\u25cf\nworldwide political conditions, particularly in significant oil producing regions;\n\u25cf\nforeign and domestic production levels of crude oil, other feedstocks, and refined products and the volume of crude oil, feedstocks, and refined products imported into the U.S.;\n\u25cf\navailability of and access to transportation infrastructure;\n\u25cf\ncapacity utilization rates of refineries in the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 influence on oil prices;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment and marketing of alternative and competing fuels;\n\u25cf\ncommodities speculation;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters (such as hurricanes and tornadoes), accidents, interruptions in transportation, inclement weather or other events that can cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries;\n\u25cf\nfederal and state governmental regulations and taxes; and\n\u25cf\nlocal factors, including market conditions, weather conditions and the level of operations of other refineries and pipelines in our markets.\nB3.\nOur future success depends on our ability to acquire sufficient levels of crude oil on favorable terms to operate the Nixon refinery.\nOperation of the Nixon refinery depends on our ability to purchase adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate. We have a long-term crude supply agreement in place with Pilot. Under the initial term of the crude supply agreement, Pilot will sell us approximately 24.8 million net bbls of crude oil. Thereafter, the crude supply agreement will continue on a one-year evergreen basis. Pilot may terminate the crude supply agreement at any time by providing us 60 days prior written notice. We may terminate the agreement upon the expiration of the initial term or at any time during a renewal term by giving Pilot 60 days prior written notice.\nPilot also stores crude oil at the Nixon facility under a terminal services agreement. Under the terminal services agreement, Pilot stores crude oil at the Nixon facility at a specified rate per bbl of the storage tank\u2019s shell capacity. The terminal services agreement has an initial term that expires April 30, 2020. Thereafter, the terminal services agreement will continue on a one-year evergreen basis. Either party may terminate the terminal services agreement by providing the other party 60 days prior written notice. However, the terminal services agreement will automatically terminate upon expiration or termination of the crude supply agreement.\nOur financial health could be adversely affected by defaults under our secured loan agreements, historic net losses, and working capital deficits, which could impact our ability to acquire crude oil and condensate. A failure to acquire crude oil and condensate when needed will have a material effect on our business results and operations.\nB4.\nDowntime at the Nixon refinery could result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense, increased inventory, and a reduction in cash available for payment of our obligations.\nThe Nixon refinery periodically experiences planned and unplanned temporary shutdowns. Unplanned shutdowns can occur for a variety of reasons, including voluntary regulatory compliance measures, cessation or suspension by regulatory authorities, or disabled equipment. However, in Texas the most typically reason is excessive heat or power outages from high winds and thunderstorms. Planned turnarounds are used to repair, restore, refurbish, or replace refinery equipment. Refineries typically undergo a major turnaround every three to five years. Since the Nixon refinery is still in the recommissioning phase, turnarounds are needed more frequently for unanticipated maintenance or repairs.\nWe are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our operations because all our refining operations are conducted at a single facility. Refinery downtime in 2019 totaled 21 days compared to 30 days in 2018, an improvement of 9 days. Refinery downtime in 2019 related to a maintenance turnaround (March 2019) and intermittent crude heater issues while refinery downtime in 2018 was for repair and maintenance of the naphtha stabilizer unit and two maintenance turnarounds (January and March 2018). Any scheduled or unscheduled downtime will result in lost margin opportunity, potential increased maintenance expense, and a reduction of refined products inventory, which could reduce our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nB5.\nWe may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate. Further, Affiliates may, but are not required to, fund our working capital requirements in the event our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity are inadequate.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short-term and long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations or pursue our business strategies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. We currently rely on revenue from operations, including sales of refined products and rental of petroleum storage tanks, Affiliates, and borrowings under bank facilities to meet our liquidity needs. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, accounts payable, related party totaled $0.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, long-term debt and accrued interest, related party was $8.2 and $8.6 million, respectively.\nIn the event our working capital requirements are inadequate, or we are otherwise unable to secure sufficient liquidity to support our short term and/or long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations, comply with certain deadlines related to environmental regulations and standards, or pursue our business strategies, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to acquisition of crude oil and condensate to operate the Nixon refinery, repayment of debt obligations, and capital expenditures for maintenance, upgrades, and refurbishment of equipment at the Nixon facility. Our long-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of long-term debt obligations. Our liquidity will affect our ability to satisfy all these needs.\nB6.\nOur business may suffer if any of the executive officers or other key personnel discontinue employment with us. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor or disruptions in our labor force may make it difficult for us to maintain productivity.\nOur future success depends on the services of the executive officers and other key personnel and on our continuing ability to recruit, train and retain highly qualified personnel in all areas of our operations. Furthermore, our operations require skilled and experienced personnel with proficiency in multiple tasks. Competition for skilled personnel with industry-specific experience is intense, and the loss of these executives or personnel could harm our business. If any of these executives or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nB7.\nLoss of market share by a key customer, one of which is an Affiliate, or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results.\nOne of our significant customers is an Affiliate. The Affiliate purchases our jet fuel under a Jet Fuel Sales Agreement and bids on jet fuel contracts under preferential pricing terms due to a HUBZone certification. The Affiliate accounted for 31.3% and 28.9% of total revenue from operations in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Affiliate represented approximately $1.4 million and $0 in accounts receivable at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amounts will be paid under normal business terms. Amounts outstanding relating to the Jet Fuel Sales Agreement can vary significantly period to period based on the timing of the related sales and payments received. Amounts we owed to LEH under various long-term debt, related-party agreements totaled $6.2 million and $6.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us, including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms, which often results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier. Our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance. Our operating results could be harmed if a key customer is lost, reduces their order quantity, requires us to reduce our prices, is acquired by a competitor, or suffers financial hardship.\nAdditionally, our profitability could be adversely affected if there is consolidation among our customer base and our customers command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale. We could decide not to sell our refined products to a certain customer if, because of increased leverage, the customer pressures us to reduce our pricing such that our gross profits are diminished, which could result in a decrease in our revenue. Consolidation may also lead to reduced demand for our products, replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors, and cancellations of orders, each of which could harm our operating results.\nB8.\nThe sale of refined products to the wholesale market is our primary business, and if we fail to maintain and grow the market share of our refined products, our operating results could suffer.\nOur success in the wholesale market depends in large part on our ability to maintain and grow our image and reputation as a reliable operator and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our refined products. Adverse perceptions of product quality, whether justified, or allegations of product quality issues, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish our reputation and cause our wholesale customers to choose refined products offered by our competitors.\nB9.\nWe are dependent on third parties for the transportation of crude oil and condensate into and refined products out of our Nixon facility, and if these third parties become unavailable to us, our ability to process crude oil and condensate and sell refined products to wholesale markets could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on trucks for the receipt of crude oil and condensate into and the sale of refined products out of our Nixon facility. Since we do not own or operate any of these trucks, their continuing operation is not within our control. If any of the third-party trucking companies that we use, or the trucking industry in general, become unavailable to transport crude oil, condensate, and/or our refined products because of acts of God, accidents, government regulation, terrorism or other events, our revenue and net income would be materially and adversely affected.\nB10.\nWe will continue to pursue acquisitions in the future.\nAlthough we regularly engage in discussions with, and submit proposals to, acquisition candidates, suitable acquisitions may not be available in the future on reasonable terms. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition, finance the acquisition, or, if the acquisition occurs, effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing businesses. Negotiations of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired business operations may require a disproportionate amount of management\u2019s attention and our resources. Even if we complete additional acquisitions, continued acquisition financing may not be available or available on reasonable terms, any new businesses may not generate the anticipated level of revenues, the anticipated cost efficiencies, or synergies may not be realized, and these businesses may not be integrated successfully or operated profitably. Our inability to successfully identify, execute, or effectively integrate future acquisitions may negatively affect our results of operations.\nB11.\nOur suppliers source a substantial amount, if not all, of our crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale and may experience interruptions of supply from that region.\nOur suppliers source a substantial amount, if not all, of our crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale. Consequently, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of supply from that region caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, unavailability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in that area.\nB12.\nOur refining operations and customers are primarily located within the Eagle Ford Shale and changes in the supply/demand balance in this region could result in lower refining margins.\nOur primary operating assets are in Nixon, Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale, and we market our refined products in a single, relatively limited geographic area. Therefore, we are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than our more geographically diversified competitors. Should the supply/demand balance shift in our region due to changes in the local economy, an increase in refining capacity or other reasons, resulting in supply in the PADD 3 (Gulf Coast) region to exceed demand, we would have to deliver refined products to customers outside of our current operating region and thus incur considerably higher transportation costs, resulting in lower refining margins.\nB13.\nClimate change and related legislation or regulation reducing emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur significant costs or could result in a decrease in demand for our refined products, which could adversely affect our business.\nCurrently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address reporting or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions have been adopted or are in various phases of discussion or implementation. Requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could cause us to incur substantial costs to: (i) operate and maintain the Nixon facility, (ii) install new emission controls at the Nixon facility, and (iii) administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs, including the acquisition or maintenance of emission credits or allowances. These requirements may also adversely affect our suppliers and customers, leading to an indirect adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.\nRequiring a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the increased use of renewable fuels could decrease demand for refined products, which could have an indirect, but material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the EPA has promulgated rules establishing greenhouse gas emission standards for new-model passenger cars, light-duty trucks and medium duty passenger vehicles. Concerns over climate change and related greenhouse gas emissions could affect demand for petroleum products as well as new energy technologies including electric vehicles, fuel cells and battery storage systems and transportation alternatives. Any of these developments, or new taxes or fees imposed on crude oil, natural gas or refined products to fund clean energy initiatives at the state or federal level, could have an indirect adverse effect on our business due to reduced demand for refined products.\nScientific studies have indicated that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can produce changes in climate with significant physical effects, including increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other extreme weather events that could affect our operations. Increased concern over the effects of climate change may also affect our customers\u2019 energy strategies, consumer consumption patterns, and government and private sector alternative energy initiatives, any of which could adversely affect demand for petroleum products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nC.\nRisks Related to Pipeline and Facilities Assets, as well as our Pipelines and Oil and Gas Properties\nC1.\nAssessment of civil penalties by BOEM for failure to satisfy orders to increase supplemental pipeline bonds and by BSEE for failure to decommission platform and pipeline assets within the time period prescribed could significantly impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nWe have pipelines and facilities assets that are subject to BSEE\u2019s idle iron regulations. BSEE mandates lessees and rights-of-way holders to permanently abandon and/or remove platforms and other structures when they are no longer useful for operations. To cover the various obligations of lessees and rights-of-way holders operating in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, BOEM evaluates an operator\u2019s financial ability to carry out present and future obligations to determine whether the operator must provide additional security beyond the minimum bonding requirements. Such obligations include the cost of plugging and abandoning wells and decommissioning and removing platforms and pipelines at the end of production or service activities. Once plugging and abandonment work has been completed, the collateral backing the financial assurance is released by BOEM.\nBDPL has historically maintained $0.9 million in financial assurance to BOEM for the decommissioning of its trunk pipeline offshore in federal waters. Following an agency restructuring of the financial assurance program, in March 2018 BOEM ordered BDPL to provide supplemental pipeline bonds totaling $4.8 million for five (5) existing pipeline rights-of-way within sixty (60) calendar days. In June 2018, BOEM issued BDPL INCs for each right-of-way that failed to comply. BDPL appealed the INCs to the IBLA, and the IBLA granted multiple extension requests that extended BDPL\u2019s deadline for filing a statement of reasons for the appeal with the IBLA. In December 2018, BSEE issued an INC to BDPL for failure to flush and fill Pipeline Segment No. 13101.\nOn August 9, 2019, BDPL timely filed its statement of reasons for the appeal with the IBLA. Management met with the BOEM and BSEE on August 15, 2019. BSEE proposed that Blue Dolphin submit permit applications for decommissioning and removal of its offshore assets within six (6) months (no later than February 15, 2020), and develop and implement a safe boarding plan for submission with such permit applications. BDPL timely submitted permit applications for decommissioning and removal of the subject offshore assets on February 11, 2020. Further, BSEE proposed that Blue Dolphin conduct approved, permitted work in a safe manner within 12 months (no later than August 15, 2020). Considering BDPL\u2019s August 2019 meeting with BOEM and BSEE, BDPL requested a stay in the IBLA matter until August 2020. The Office of the Solicitor of the U.S. Department of the Interior was agreeable to a 10-day extension while it conferred with BOEM on BDPL\u2019s stay request. In late October 2019, BDPL filed a motion to request the 10-day extension, which motion was subsequently granted by the IBLA. The solicitor\u2019s office consented to an additional 14-day extension for BDPL to file its reply, and BDPL filed a motion to request the 14-day extension in November 2019. The solicitor\u2019s office indicated that BOEM would not consent to further extensions. However, the solicitor\u2019s office signaled that BDPL\u2019s adherence to the milestones identified in the August 15, 2019 meeting may help in future discussions with BOEM related to the INCs.\nBDPL reasonably expects that successful completion of its decommissioning obligations prior to BSEE\u2019s August 2020 deadline will significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of financial assurance required by BOEM, which may serve to partially or fully resolve the INCs. BDPL expects to complete approved, permitted decommission work by the BSEE August 2020 deadline. If decommissioning of the assets is not completed by the allowable deadline, BDPL will be subject to vigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement, including but not limited to failure to correct an INC, civil penalties, and revocation of BDPL\u2019s operator designation, which may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and liquidity.\nBDPL\u2019s pending appeal of the INCs does not relieve BDPL of its obligations to provide additional financial assurance or of BOEM\u2019s authority to impose financial penalties. If BDPL is required by BOEM to provide significant additional financial assurance or is assessed significant penalties under the INCs, we will experience a significant and material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of the INCs. Accordingly, we have not recorded a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, BDPL maintained approximately $0.9 million in credit and cash-backed pipeline rights-of-way bonds issued to BOEM. As of December 31, 2019, we maintained $2.6 million in AROs related to abandonment of these assets.\nD.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nD1.\nOur stock price may decline due to sales of shares by Affiliates.\nAffiliates sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities in the future. Affiliates could elect in the future to request that we file a registration statement to them to sell shares of our Common Stock. If Affiliates were to sell a large number of shares into the public markets, Affiliates could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nD2.\nWe are authorized to issue up to a total of 20 million shares of our Common Stock and 2.5 million shares of preferred stock, potentially diluting equity ownership of current holders and the share price of our Common Stock.\nWe believe that it is necessary to maintain a sufficient number of available authorized shares of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock to provide us with the flexibility to issue Common Stock or Preferred Stock for business purposes that may arise as deemed advisable by our Board. These purposes could include, among other things, (i) future stock dividends or stock splits, which may increase the liquidity of our shares; (ii) the sale of stock to obtain additional capital or to acquire other companies or businesses, which could enhance our growth strategy or allow us to reduce debt if needed; and (iii) for other bona fide purposes. Our Board may authorize us to issue the available authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock without notice to, or further action by, our stockholders, unless stockholder approval is required by law or the rules of the OTCQX. The issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may significantly dilute the equity ownership of the current holders of our Common Stock.\nRemainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank", "PERMNO": 76310, "SIC": 4922, "TIC": "BDCO"}
