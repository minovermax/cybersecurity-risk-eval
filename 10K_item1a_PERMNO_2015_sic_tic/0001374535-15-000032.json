Some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate, such as helical gear drives, and some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial and other resources. With respect to certain of our products, we compete with divisions of our OEM customers. Competition in our business lines is based on a number of considerations, including quality, reliability, pricing, availability, and design and application engineering support. Our customers increasingly demand a broad product range and we must continue to develop our expertise in order to manufacture and market these products successfully. To remain competitive, regular investment in manufacturing, customer service, and support, marketing, sales, research and development and intellectual property protection is required. In the future we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments and may not be able to maintain our competitive position within each of the markets we serve. We may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive.\nAdditionally, some of our larger, more sophisticated customers are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to increase their efficiency. If we are not selected to become one of these preferred providers, we may lose market share in some of the markets in which we compete.\nThere is substantial and continuing pressure on major OEMs and larger distributors to reduce costs, including the cost of products purchased from outside suppliers. As a result of cost pressures from our customers, our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to generate production cost savings and, in turn, to find reliable, cost effective outside suppliers to source components or manufacture our products. If we are unable to generate sufficient cost savings in the future to offset price reductions, then our gross margin could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in or the cyclical nature of our markets could harm our operations and financial performance.\nOur financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve and on the U.S. and global economies in general. Some of the markets we serve are highly cyclical, such as the metals, mining, industrial equipment and energy markets, including oil and gas. In such an environment, expected cyclical activity or sales may not occur or may be delayed and may result in significant quarter-to-quarter variability in our performance. Any sustained weakness in demand, downturn or uncertainty in cyclical markets may reduce our sales and profitability.\nWe rely on independent distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives, we depend on the services of independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers. We support an extensive distribution network, with over 3,000 distributor locations worldwide. Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, our independent distributors are active participants in the overall competitive dynamics in the MPT industry. During the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 31% of our net sales from continuing operations were generated through independent distributors. In particular, sales through our largest distributor accounted for approximately 7% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers. In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically non-exclusive and cancelable by the distributor after a short notice period. The loss of any major distributor or a substantial number of smaller distributors or an increase in the distributors\u2019 sales of our competitors\u2019 products to our customers could materially reduce our sales and profits.\nWe must continue to invest in new technologies and manufacturing techniques; however, our ability to develop or adapt to changing technology and manufacturing techniques is uncertain and our failure to do so could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy requires us to continuously invest in new technologies and manufacturing techniques to evolve our existing products and introduce new products to meet our customers\u2019 needs in the industries we serve and want to serve. For example, motion control products offer more precise positioning and control compared to industrial clutches and brakes. If manufacturing processes are developed to make motion control products more price competitive and less complicated to operate, our customers may decrease their purchases of MPT products.\nOur products are characterized by performance and specification requirements that mandate a high degree of manufacturing and engineering expertise. We believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022product quality and availability;\n\u2022price competitiveness;\n\u2022technical expertise and development capability;\n\u2022reliability and timeliness of delivery;\n\u2022product design capability;\n\u2022manufacturing expertise; and\n\u2022sales support and customer service.\nOur success depends on our ability to invest in new technologies and manufacturing techniques to continue to meet our customers\u2019 changing demands with respect to the above factors. We may not be able to make required capital expenditures and, even if we do so, we may be unsuccessful in addressing technological advances or introducing new products necessary to remain competitive within our markets. Furthermore, our own technological developments may not be able to produce a sustainable competitive advantage. If we fail to invest successfully in improvements to our technology and manufacturing techniques, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations are subject to international risks that could affect our operating results.\nOur net sales outside North America represented approximately 40% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, we sell products to domestic customers for use in their products sold overseas. We also source a significant portion of our products and materials from overseas, a practice which is increasing. Our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, and our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nexchange rate controls;\n\u2022\ntariffs or other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign intellectual property law;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\nrequirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments or acquire new businesses in various jurisdictions;\n\u2022\npotential political instability and the actions of foreign governments; and\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. However, any of these factors could materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our operating results.\nOur operations depend on commercial activities and production facilities throughout the world, many of which may be located in jurisdictions that are subject to increased risks of disrupted production or commercial activities causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue.\nWe operate businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, many of which are located outside the United States including in Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Mexico, Russia, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. Serving a global customer base requires that we place production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and cost efficiencies. Our international production facilities and operations and commercial activities could be disrupted by currency fluctuations and devaluation, capital and currency exchange controls, low or negative economic growth rates, natural disaster, labor strike, military activity or war, political unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equipped to handle such occurrences. Any such disruptions could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on estimated forecasts of our OEM customers\u2019 needs, and inaccuracies in such forecasts could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of under long-term purchase commitments. Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture. Because our sales are based on purchase orders, our customers may cancel, delay or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us. For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers\u2019 actual product needs. The quantities or timing required by our customers for our products could vary significantly. Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer\u2019s specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay or other modification in our customers\u2019 orders could significantly reduce our revenue, impact our working capital, cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue. In the event of a cancellation or reduction of an order, we may not have enough time to reduce operating expenses to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business and we may purchase too much inventory and spend more capital than expected, which may materially adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses. In addition, during periods of economic difficulty, our customers may not be able to accurately estimate demand forecasts and may scale back orders in an abundance of caution. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Such cancellations, reductions or inability to fulfill obligations could significantly reduce our revenue, impact our working capital, cause our operating results to fluctuate adversely from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue.\nOur inability to efficiently utilize or re-negotiate minimum purchase requirements in certain supply agreements could decrease our profitability.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to continue to obtain raw materials and component parts on favorable terms from various suppliers. Agreements with some of our suppliers contain minimum\npurchase requirements. We can give no assurance that we will be able to utilize the minimum amount of raw materials or component parts that we are required to purchase under certain supply agreements which contain minimum purchase requirements. If we are required to purchase more raw materials or component parts than we are able to utilize in the operation of our business, the costs of providing our products would likely increase, which could decrease our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability, including manufacturing or distribution capabilities, and that of our suppliers, business partners and contract manufacturers, to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at our facilities, excessive demand, raw material shortages, or other reasons, could impair our ability, and that of our suppliers, to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nThe materials used to produce our products are subject to price fluctuations that could increase costs of production and adversely affect our profitability.\nThe materials used to produce our products, especially copper and steel, are sourced on a global or regional basis and the prices of those materials are susceptible to price fluctuations due to supply and demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances. From the first quarter of 2004 to the fourth quarter of 2014, the average price of copper and steel has increased approximately 109% and 77%, respectively. If we are unable to continue to pass a substantial portion of such price increases on to our customers on a timely basis, our future profitability may be materially adversely affected. In addition, passing through these costs to our customers may also limit our ability to increase our prices in the future.\nWe face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or distribute, which could result in our having to expend significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material damages or settlement amounts.\nWe face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects. We currently have several product liability claims against us with respect to our products. Although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful product liability defense could exceed any insurance that we maintain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or our ability to make payments under our debt obligations when due. In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed. In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.\nWe also risk exposure to product liability claims in connection with products sold by businesses that we acquire. Although in some cases third parties have retained responsibility for product liabilities relating to products manufactured or sold prior to our acquisition of the relevant business and in other cases the persons from whom we have acquired a business may be required to indemnify us for certain product liability claims subject to certain caps or limitations on indemnification, we cannot assure you that those third parties will in fact satisfy their obligations to us with respect to liabilities retained by them or their indemnification obligations. If those third parties become unable to or otherwise do not comply with their respective obligations including indemnity obligations, or if certain product liability claims for which we are obligated were not retained by third parties or are not subject to these indemnities, we could become subject to significant liabilities or other adverse consequences. Moreover, even in cases where third parties retain responsibility for product liabilities or are required to indemnify us, significant claims arising from products that we have acquired could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the benefits from an acquisition, could result in our reducing the value of goodwill that we have recorded in connection with an acquisition, or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operations.\nWe may be subject to work stoppages at our facilities, or our customers may be subjected to work stoppages, which could seriously impact our operations and the profitability of our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 3,957 full-time employees, of whom approximately 51% were located in North America (primarily U.S.), 33% in Europe, and 16% in Asia and the rest of the world. Approximately 15% of our full-time factory U.S. employees are represented by labor unions. In addition, approximately 733 employees or 56% of our European employees are represented by labor unions or works councils. Approximately 60 employees in the Kilian production facilities\nin Toronto, Canada are unionized under a collective bargaining agreement. Approximately 55 employees in the Lamiflex production facilities in Brazil are represented by a works council. Additionally, approximately 45 employees in the TB Wood\u2019s production facilities in Mexico are unionized under collective bargaining agreements that are subject to annual renewals.\nWe are a party to four U.S. collective bargaining agreements. The agreements will expire in July 2015, October 2016, June 2017 and February 2018.\nWe are also party to a collective bargaining agreement with union employees at our Toronto, Canada manufacturing facility. That agreement will expire in July 2015. We may be unable to renew these agreements on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all.\nOne of the four U.S. collective bargaining agreements contains provisions for additional, potentially significant, lump-sum severance payments to all employees covered by that agreement who are terminated as the result of a plant closing and one of our collective bargaining agreements contains provisions restricting our ability to terminate or relocate operations.\nOur facilities in Europe and Brazil have employees who are generally represented by local or national social works councils. Social works councils meet with employer industry associations periodically to discuss employee wages and working conditions. Our facilities in Denmark, France, Germany, Slovakia, and Brazil often participate in such discussions and adhere to any agreements reached.\nIf our unionized workers or those represented by a works council were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown in the future, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations. Such disruption could interfere with our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and could have other negative effects, including decreased productivity and increased labor costs. In addition, if a greater percentage of our work force becomes unionized, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Many of our direct and indirect customers have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these customers or their suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of assembly plants where our products are used and could cause cancellation of purchase orders with us or otherwise result in reduced revenues from these customers.\nChanges in employment laws could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.\nVarious federal, state and international labor laws govern our relationship with employees and affect operating costs. These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates paid, leaves of absence, mandated health and other benefits, and citizenship requirements. Significant additional government-imposed increases or new requirements in these areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow.\nIn the event our employee-related costs rise significantly, we may have to curtail the number of our employees or shut down certain manufacturing facilities. Any such actions would not only be costly but could also materially adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, the loss of whom could materially harm our business.\nOur senior executives are important to our success because they are instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating our business, maintaining and expanding relationships with distributors, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, identifying expansion opportunities and arranging necessary financing. Losing the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement could be found. We believe that our senior executives could not easily be replaced with executives of equal experience and capabilities. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our key domestic executives, we cannot prevent our key executives from terminating their employment with us. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executives.\nIf we lose certain of our key sales, marketing or engineering personnel, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled sales, marketing and engineering personnel. Competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel. If we fail to retain and recruit the necessary personnel, our business and our ability to obtain new customers, develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer. If certain of these key personnel were to terminate their employment with us, we may experience difficulty replacing them, and our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, foreign and provincial environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the management and disposal of hazardous\nsubstances and wastes and the responsibility to investigate and cleanup contaminated sites that are or were owned, leased, operated or used by us or our predecessors. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits, which contain terms and conditions that impose limitations on our ability to emit and discharge hazardous materials into the environment and periodically may be subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. Fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and the failure to have or to comply with the terms and conditions of required permits. From time to time, our operations may not be in full compliance with the terms and conditions of our permits. We periodically review our procedures and policies for compliance with environmental laws and requirements. We believe that our operations generally are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, requirements and permits and that any lapses in compliance would not be expected to result in us incurring material liability or cost to achieve compliance. Historically, the costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental laws, and requirements and permits have not been material; however, the operation of manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and a failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations, or permits could result in civil or criminal fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the costs of cleanup, or regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions. Moreover, if applicable environmental laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, become more stringent in the future, we could incur capital or operating costs beyond those currently anticipated.\nCertain environmental laws in the United States, such as the federal Superfund law and similar state laws, impose liability for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated sites upon the current or, in some cases, the former site owners or operators and upon parties who arranged for the disposal of wastes or transported or sent those wastes to an off-site facility for treatment or disposal, regardless of when the release of hazardous substances occurred or the lawfulness of the activities giving rise to the release. Such liability can be imposed without regard to fault and, under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. As a practical matter, however, the costs of investigation and remediation generally are allocated among the viable responsible parties on some form of equitable basis. Liability also may include damages to natural resources. In addition, from time to time, we are notified that we are a potentially responsible party and may have liability in connection with off-site disposal facilities. To date, we have generally resolved matters involving off-site disposal facilities for a nominal sum although there can be no assurance that we will be able to resolve pending and future matters in a similar fashion.\nHowever, there is contamination at some of our current facilities, primarily related to historical operations at those sites, for which we could be liable for the investigation and remediation under certain environmental laws. The potential for contamination also exists at other of our current or former sites, based on historical uses of those sites. We currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigations and our costs or liability in connection with potential contamination conditions at our facilities cannot be predicted at this time because the potential existence of contamination has not been investigated or not enough is known about the environmental conditions or likely remedial requirements. Currently, other parties with contractual liability are addressing or have plans or obligations to address those contamination conditions that may pose a material risk to human health, safety or the environment. In addition, while we attempt to evaluate the risk of liability associated with our facilities at the time we acquire them, there may be environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our prior, existing or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are being indemnified, or expect to be indemnified by third parties subject to certain caps or limitations on the indemnification, for certain environmental costs and liabilities associated with certain owned or operated sites. Accordingly, based on the indemnification and the experience with similar sites of the environmental consultants who we have hired, we do not expect such costs and liabilities to have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or earnings. We cannot assure you, however, that those third parties will in fact satisfy their indemnification obligations. If those third parties become unable to, or otherwise do not, comply with their respective indemnity obligations, or if certain contamination or other liability for which we are obligated is not subject to these indemnities, we could become subject to significant liabilities.\nOur future success depends on our ability to integrate acquired companies and manage our growth effectively.\nOur growth through acquisitions has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational and financial resources. Realization of the benefits of acquisitions often requires integration of some or all of the acquired companies\u2019 sales and marketing, distribution, manufacturing, engineering, finance and administrative organizations. Integration of companies demands substantial attention from senior management and the management of the acquired companies. In addition, we will continue to pursue new acquisitions, some of which could be material to our business if completed. We may not be able to integrate successfully our recent acquisitions, or any future acquisitions, operate these acquired companies profitably, or realize the potential benefits from these acquisitions.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of acquisitions if, among other things, we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings, or if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of the acquired businesses are not realized, or if the transaction costs related to the acquisitions are greater than expected. The market price of our common stock also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisitions on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, brands or technology effectively, which could allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our technology and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as on license, non-disclosure, employee and consultant assignment and other agreements and domain names registrations in order to protect our proprietary technology and rights. Applications for protection of our intellectual property rights may not be allowed, and the rights, if granted, may not be maintained. In addition, third parties may infringe or challenge our intellectual property rights. In some cases, we rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. In addition, in the ordinary course of our operations, we pursue potential claims from time to time relating to the protection of certain products and intellectual property rights, including with respect to some of our more profitable products. Such claims could be time consuming, expensive and divert resources. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies or proprietary protection of our brands, our ability to market or be competitive with respect to some or all of our products may be affected, which could reduce our sales and profitability.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles comprises a significant portion of our total assets, and if we determine that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles become impaired in the future, net income in such years may be materially and adversely affected.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Due to the acquisitions we have completed historically, goodwill comprises a significant portion of our total assets. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations. Our review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles at December 2014 resulted in no reduction to the value of such assets in our financial statements. Future reviews of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could result in reductions. Any reduction in net income resulting from the write down or impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could adversely affect our financial results. If economic conditions deteriorate we may be required to impair goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in future periods.\nUnplanned repairs or equipment outages could interrupt production and reduce income or cash flow.\nUnplanned repairs or equipment outages, including those due to natural disasters, could result in the disruption of our manufacturing processes. Any interruption in our manufacturing processes would interrupt our production of products, reduce our income and cash flow and could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur operations are highly dependent on information technology infrastructure and failures could significantly affect our business.\nWe depend heavily on our information technology, or IT, infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives. If we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure, such as a computer virus, a problem with the functioning of an important IT application, or an intentional disruption of our IT systems by a third party, the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns.\nComputer viruses, malware, and other \u201chacking\u201d programs and devices may cause significant damage, delays or interruptions to our systems and operations or to certain of the products that we sell resulting in damage to our reputation and brand names.\nComputer viruses, malware, and other \u201chacking\u201d programs and devices may attack our infrastructure, industrial machinery, software, or hardware causing significant damage, delays or other service interruptions to our systems and operations. \u201cHacking\u201d involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems or to cause intentional malfunctions, loss or corruption of data, software, hardware, or other computer equipment. In addition, increasingly sophisticated malware may target real-world infrastructure or product components, including certain of the products that we currently or may in the future sell by attacking, disrupting, reconfiguring and/or reprogramming industrial control software. Hacking, computer viruses, and other malware could result in significant damage to our infrastructure, industrial machinery, systems, or databases. We may incur significant costs to protect our systems and equipment against the threat of, and to repair\nany damage caused by, computer viruses and hacking. Moreover, if a computer virus or hacking affects our systems or products, our reputation and brand names could be materially damaged and use of our products may decrease.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement our new ERP system across the Company or such implementation is delayed, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning system entitled \u201cSAP\u201d worldwide, with the aim of enabling management to achieve better control over the Company through: improved quality, reliability and timeliness of information; improved integration and visibility of information stemming from different management functions and countries; and optimization and global management of corporate processes. The adoption of the new SAP system, which replaces the existing accounting and management systems, poses several challenges relating to, among other things, training of personnel, communication of new rules and procedures, changes in corporate culture, migration of data, and the potential instability of the new system. In order to mitigate the impact of such critical issues, the Company decided to implement the new SAP system on a step-by-step basis, both geographically and in terms of processes. To date, we have completed implementation at 17 of our 26 business units. Currently, we do not have a time line to complete implementations at the remaining business units. If the remaining implementation of the SAP system is delayed, in whole or in part, we would continue to use our current systems which may not be sufficient to support our planned operations and significant upgrades to the current systems may be warranted or required to meet our business needs pending SAP implementation. In addition, we rely on third-party vendors to provide long-term software maintenance support and hosting services for our information systems. Software vendors may decide to discontinue further development, integration or long-term software maintenance support for our information systems, which may increase our operational expense as well as disrupt the management of our business operations. In addition, we do not control the operation of any third party hosting facilities. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. The occurrence of any of these disasters or other unanticipated problems with our third party hosting vendors could disrupt the management of, and have a material adverse effect on, our business operations. However, there can be no assurance that the new SAP system will be successfully implemented and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations.\nOur leverage could adversely affect our financial health and make us vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $268.5 million of gross indebtedness outstanding including (i) a principal balance of $85.0 million outstanding under our Convertible Notes (as defined herein); (ii) $40.0 million outstanding and $149.0 million available under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein); and (iii) $87.3 million and \u20ac38.2 million outstanding under our Term Loan Facility (as defined herein). Our indebtedness has important consequences; for example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more challenging for us to obtain additional financing to fund our business strategy and acquisitions, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to interest rate changes and general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to finance acquisitions and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate activities;\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under our credit and other debt agreements;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our markets; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt.\nSubstantially all of the domestic personal property of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and certain shares of certain non-domestic subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral against any outstanding borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated December 6, 2013 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) governing our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives.\nIn the future, the then current economic and credit market conditions may limit our access to additional capital, to the extent that the Credit Agreement would otherwise permit additional financing, or may preclude our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that there will not be a deterioration in the credit markets, a deterioration in the financial condition of our lenders or their ability to fund their commitments or, if necessary, that we will be able to find replacement financing, if need be, on similar or acceptable terms. An inability to access sufficient financing or capital could have an adverse impact on our operations and thus on our operating results and financial position.\nOur Credit Agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing our business strategies or favorable business opportunities.\nSubject to a number of important exceptions, the Credit Agreement may limit our ability to:\n\u2022incur more debt;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022redeem stock;\n\u2022issue stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022reorganize our corporate structure;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022merge or consolidate; and\n\u2022transfer or sell assets.\nThe restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. A breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Agreement may elect to declare all of the outstanding debt, under the Credit Agreement together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the Credit Agreement also have the right in those circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders under the Credit Agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral described above that secures the debt. If the debt under the Credit Agreement were to be accelerated, we may not have the ability to refinance that debt, and if we can, the terms of such refinancing may be less favorable than the current financing terms under the Credit Agreement. In the event that the indebtedness is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full all of our debt.\nWe face risks associated with our exposure to variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Some of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, generally linked to market benchmarks such as LIBOR. Any increase in interest rates would increase our finance expenses relating to our variable rate indebtedness and increase the costs of refinancing our existing indebtedness and issuing new debt. A portion of our indebtedness is also euro denominated. In addition, we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of the countries in which we operate. As we continue expanding our business into markets such as Europe, China, Australia and South America, we expect that an increasing percentage of our revenue and cost of sales will be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, our reporting currency. As a result, we are subject to currency translation risk, whereby changes in exchange rates between the dollar and the other currencies in which we borrow and do business could result in foreign exchange losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to swap counterparty credit risk that could materially and adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we rely on interest rate swap contracts and hedging arrangements to effectively manage our interest rate risk. We entered into an interest rate swap in 2013 to hedge exposure to variable rate interest rates payable on $82.5 million of our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Failure to perform under a derivatives contract by one or more of our counterparties could disrupt our hedging operations, particularly if we were entitled to a termination payment under the terms of the contract that we did not receive, if we had to make a termination payment upon default of the counterparty, or if we were unable to reposition the swap with a new counterparty.\nOur stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of our Convertible Notes.\nOur Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock beginning March 1, 2030 or, under certain circumstances including where our stock trades above 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time as set forth in the Convertible Notes, earlier. Upon conversion, we must deliver shares of our common stock or cash. The conversion rate of our Convertible Notes was initially 36.0985 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of our convertible notes (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $27.70 per share of common stock), and as of December 31, 2014 is 37.44\nshares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of our convertible notes (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $26.71 per share of common stock), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Based on the current conversion rate, the maximum number of shares of common stock that would be issued upon conversion of the $85.0 million convertible debt currently outstanding is 3,182,761. In addition, our stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of our common stock upon our issuance of common stock in connection with the conversion of our convertible notes and any dividends paid on our common stock will also be paid on shares issued in connection with such conversion after such issuance. In the event the average price of our stock exceeds the conversion price we will be required to include the maximum number of shares of common stock that would be issued upon conversion in our calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding which will have the effect of decreasing our earnings per share.\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions and the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities related to our current or acquired businesses could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nWe conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position.\nCertain of our businesses are exposed to renewable energy markets which depend significantly on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives.\nCertain of our businesses sell product to customers within the renewable energy market, which among other energy sources includes wind energy and solar energy. At present, the cost of many forms of renewable energy exceeds the cost of conventional power generation in many locations around the world. Various governments have used different policy initiatives to encourage or accelerate the development and adoption of renewable energy sources such as wind energy and solar energy. Renewable energy policies are in place in the European Union, certain countries in Asia, including China, Japan and South Korea, and many of the states in Australia and the United States. Examples of government- sponsored financial incentives include capital cost rebates, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, net metering and other incentives to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of renewable energy products to promote the use of renewable energy and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. Governments may decide to reduce or eliminate these economic incentives for political, financial or other reasons. Reductions in, or eliminations of, government subsidies and economic incentives before renewable energy markets reach a sufficient scale to be cost-effective in a non-subsidized marketplace could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These new requirements required country of origin inquiries and potentially due diligence, with initial disclosure requirements beginning in May 2014 relating to activities in 2013. There have been and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for country of origin inquiries and due diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.\nContinued volatility and disruption in global financial markets could significantly impact our customers, suppliers, weaken the markets we serve and harm our operations and financial performance.\nOur financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve and on the U.S. and global economies in general. As widely reported, U.S. and global financial markets have been experiencing disruption in recent years. Further, economic conditions in the European Union have deteriorated and, with the Bauer Acquisition and the Svendborg Acquisition, our exposure to European markets has increased. Given the significance and widespread nature of these circumstances, the U.S., European, and global economies could remain significantly challenged for an indeterminate period of time. While currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies. In\naddition, a tight credit market may adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, a tight credit market may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. These conditions would harm our business by adversely affecting our sales, results of operations, profitability, cash flows, financial condition and long-term anticipated growth rate, which could result in potential impairment of certain long-term assets including goodwill.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of the Guardian Acquisition, the Svendborg Acquisition and the Lamiflex Acquisition because of integration difficulties and other challenges.\nThe success of the Guardian Acquisition, the Svendborg Acquisition and the Lamiflex Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from integrating the Guardian, Svendborg, and Lamiflex businesses with our existing businesses. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of integrating the operations of the Guardian, Svendborg, and Lamiflex businesses include, among others:\n\u2022\nfailure to implement our business plan for the combined business;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\npossible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, and compensation structures;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key employees;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key customers;\n\u2022\noperating risks inherent in the Guardian business, the Svendborg business, the Lamiflex business, and our business;\n\u2022\nthe impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.\nWe may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of Altra, Guardian, Svendborg and Lamiflex had achieved or might achieve separately. In addition, we may not accomplish the integration of the Guardian, Svendborg and Lamiflex\u2019s businesses smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe.\nWe face risks associated with the Purchase Agreement in connection with the Svendborg Acquisition.\nIn connection with the Svendborg Acquisition, we are subject to substantially all of the liabilities of Svendborg that were not satisfied on or prior to the closing date. There may be liabilities that we underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of Svendborg. Under the Purchase Agreement, the seller agreed to provide us with a limited set of representations and warranties, including with respect to outstanding and potential liabilities. Claims for a breach of a representation or warranty are secured by a limited escrow and warranty and indemnity insurance. There can be no assurance, however, that this limited security will be adequate or available to satisfy potential claims. Damages resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and there is no guarantee that we would actually be able to recover all or any portion of the sums payable to us in connection with such breach.\nWe may not realize the expected growth and production savings from our facility in Changzhou, China.\nWe have completed the construction of a new plant in Changzhou, China at the end of 2012. There are numerous risks and uncertainties that may prevent us from achieving the revenues necessary to sustain and grow this facility. Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to: offer new and innovative products to attract and retain a larger customer base; attract additional customers; undertake more contracted projects; maintain effective control of our costs and expenses; respond to evolving social, economic and political changes in China; respond to competitive market conditions; manage risks associated with intellectual property rights; and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. If we are unsuccessful in addressing any of these risks and uncertainties and such growth or production savings do not materialize, or should the timeline for full production at the facility be delayed, we may be unable to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 91658, "SIC": 3560, "TIC": "AIMC"}
