{"cik": "1644406", "company": "Hostess Brands, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are those which we believe are the material risks that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. Any risk described below may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition. Under these circumstances, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BRANDS, REPUTATION AND COMPETITION\nMaintaining, extending and expanding our reputation and brand images are essential to our business success.\nWe have many iconic brands with long-standing consumer recognition. Our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand images for our existing products, extend our brands to new platforms, and expand our brand image with new product offerings.\nWe seek to maintain, extend, and expand our brand images through marketing investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, and product innovation. Increasing attention on the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand images. It could also lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of marketing practices. Existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our labeling, advertising, consumer promotions and marketing, or our response to those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend and expand our brands. Moreover, regulatory or legal action against us, product recalls or other adverse publicity could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers\u2019 confidence and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if these actions are unfounded or not material to our operations.\nOur reputation could be adversely impacted by the perception that we don't maintain high ethical, social or environmental standards for all of our operations and activities or a perceived negative environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, energy use and waste management. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment. We increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media, whether or not valid, could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain, extend, and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to leverage our brand value to compete against lower-priced alternative brands.\nIn most of our product categories, we compete with lower-priced alternative products. Our products must provide higher value and/or quality to our consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands change in favor of competitors\u2019 products or if consumers perceive this type of change. If consumers choose the lower-priced brands, then we could lose market share and sales volumes, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may be unable to correctly predict, identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new products or methods of distribution to meet those changes.\nConsumer preferences for food and snacking products continually change. Our success will depend on our ability to predict, identify and interpret the tastes, dietary habits, purchasing behavior and other preferences of consumers and to offer products that appeal to these preferences. Moreover, weak economic conditions, recession or other factors could affect consumer preferences and demand. If we do not offer products that appeal to consumers or if we misjudge consumer preferences and demand for our products, our sales and market share will decrease and our financial condition and operating results could suffer.\nWe continually introduce new products or product extensions and our operating results and growth will depend upon the market reception of such new products. There can be no assurance that new products will find widespread acceptance among consumers, and unsuccessful product launches may decrease our profitability and damage our brands\u2019 reputation.\nThe continued prevalence of e-commerce and other methods of distribution outside of traditional retail shopping could also impact our sales and profitability if we are unable to adequately modify the marketing and distribution of our products in response.\nIn addition, prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. For example, consumers are increasingly focused on health and wellness and are aware of product ingredients such as added sugar and artificial flavors or colors. We might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and social expectations.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and our failure to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets and trade dress, to be a significant and valuable part of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of applicable laws, registrations of our intellectual property, third-party agreements (including non-disclosures, assignments, distribution and/or manufacturing, licenses, consents and co-existence) and policing and enforcement of third-party misuse or infringement of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business. In addition, third-party claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products.\nAny litigation regarding intellectual property (including third-party infringement claims or litigation initiated by us to protect our intellectual property rights) could be costly and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s and other key personnel\u2019s attention from our business operations. Any of the occurrences outlined above could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and operating results.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe snacking industry is highly competitive. Numerous brands and products compete for shelf space and sales, with competition based primarily on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, price, trade promotion, consumer promotion, and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences. We face competition from other large national brands, smaller regional operators, supermarket chains with their own private labeled brands and diversified food companies. Our competitors include a significant number of companies of varying sizes, including divisions, subdivisions, or subsidiaries of larger companies. Many of these competitors have multiple product lines, substantially greater financial and other resources available to them, and may be substantially less leveraged than us. We may not be able to compete successfully with these companies. Competitive pressures or other factors could cause us to lose market share, which may require us to lower prices, increase marketing and advertising expenditures, or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns, each of which could materially and adversely affect our margins and could result in an adverse effect to our financial condition and operating results.\nOur success will depend on our continued ability to produce and successfully market products with extended shelf life.\nWe have invested to extend our product shelf life, while maintaining our products\u2019 taste, texture and quality. Extended shelf life, or ESL, is an important component of our DTW model. Our ability to produce and successfully market existing and new products with ESL, while maintaining taste, texture and quality, is essential to our success. If we are unable to continue to produce products with ESL or if the products are not accepted by consumers, we could be forced to make changes to our distribution model or products that could have an adverse effect on our product sales, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be limited in our ability to pass cost increases on to our customers in the form of price increases.\nWe may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials, labor, energy, and other input costs to our customers by raising prices. In the event we increase our prices, customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lower-priced offerings, which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may realize a decrease in sales volume in the event price increases are implemented.\nConsumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products, and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether. Retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lower-priced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes. Accordingly, sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward our lower-margin offerings. As a result, decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES\nOur growth may be limited by our inability to maintain or add additional shelf or retail space for our products.\nOur results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth, in part, by expanding the distribution channels for our products. However, our ability to do so may be limited by our inability to secure additional shelf, display, or other retail space for our products. Retail space for snacks is limited and subject to competitive and other pressures, and there can be no assurance that retail operators will provide us sufficient space for our products to enable us to meet our growth objectives. If we are unable to maintain or increase our retail space we could experience an adverse impact on our product sales, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not successfully identify or complete strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate acquisition candidates, alliances or joint ventures that may strategically fit our business objectives, or we may consider divesting businesses that no longer meet our strategic objectives, growth or profitability targets. These activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks, including, but not limited to, diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing core businesses. In addition, to the extent we undertake acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures or other developments outside our core geography or in new categories, we may face additional risks related to such developments. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses or brands.\nFrom time to time, we acquire businesses or brands to expand our product portfolio and distribution. We may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with the acquisition, integration, or management of the acquired businesses or brands and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in integrating them into our operating and internal control structures. We may also experience delays in extending our internal control over financial reporting to a newly acquired business, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. Our financial performance depends in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of acquired businesses or brands. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for such acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve such objectives or successfully integrate acquired businesses or brands, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected.\nWe may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key products or add products that are faster-growing and more profitable.\nThe snacking industry\u2019s overall growth is linked to population growth. Our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key products. Because our operations are concentrated in the North American snacking industry, our success also depends in part on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manufacture or source new products or that new products will find widespread acceptance among consumers. Our failure to drive revenue growth in our key products or develop innovative new products could materially and adversely affect our profitability, financial condition and operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic, or the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could adversely impact or cause disruption to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy, may further disrupt financial markets and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues.\nIn response to COVID-19, certain governmental authorities have issued orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of the pandemic. More restrictive proclamations and/or directives may be issued in the future. As a food producer, we are an essential service and the majority of our employees continue to work within our bakeries and distribution facilities. However, we have had increased labor costs resulting from the payment of overtime to certain of our employees while other employees have been on paid sick leave or unpaid leaves of absence. We have also incurred expenses related to additional sanitization and safety measures we have instituted throughout our facilities. Although the temporary reductions in production at our bakeries to enable sanitization and implementation of our other safety and employee welfare programs have not materially affected our operations, other food producers have experienced significant shutdowns of production. We cannot assure you that our health and safety measures will prevent a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 at our facilities. Such an outbreak could lead to a suspension of production or increased labor and other costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are actively monitoring the potential impact of the pandemic on our operations and distribution. Our products are manufactured in North America, and we may experience disruptions to our operations including in our supply chain and in our ability to obtain ingredients, packaging, and other sourced materials due to labor shortages, governmental restrictions, or the failure of our suppliers, distributors, or manufacturers to meet their obligations to us. We are unable to accurately predict the impact that the coronavirus will have due to various uncertainties, including the severity of the disease and its potential variants, the duration of outbreaks, the effectiveness of vaccines or other treatments and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities. We also cannot predict the effects of any future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate conditions in our other risk factors noted in this Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d If we are unable to successfully manage our business through the challenges and uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are not within our control, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe cost to manufacture our products is subject to pricing volatility.\nWe purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including flour, sweeteners, edible oils and compound coating to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of corrugate and films to package our products.\nPrices for commodities, labor, energy, transportation and other inputs are volatile and can fluctuate due to inflationary pressures that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather, the potential effects of climate change, consumer, industrial or investment demand, and changes in regulatory, trade, alternative energy, or agricultural policies. Rising commodity, energy, transportation and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program, and seek to utilize forward buying strategies through short-term and long-term advance purchase contracts, to lock in prices for certain high-volume raw materials, packaging components and fuel inputs. These strategies, however, may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs.\nDamage or disruption to our supply chain, including third-party manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities, due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), strikes, government action, or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe source the significant majority of our ingredients, raw materials and packaging within North America. However, global supply may become constrained, which may cause the price of certain ingredients, raw materials and packaging used in our products to increase, such ingredients may become unavailable and/or we may experience disruptions to our operations.\nContinued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities, transportation and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer. Moreover, increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes. If we are not successful in our buying strategies and production efficiencies, or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs, then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nThe loss of one or more of our current co-manufacturing arrangements could adversely affect our business.\nWe use independent contract manufacturers, or co-manufacturers, to manufacture a portion of our products. In some cases, an individual co-manufacturer may produce all of our requirements for a particular product. There are a limited number of qualified co-manufacturers in the industry. Therefore, if we lose or need to change one or more co-manufacturers or fail to retain co-manufacturers for newly acquired or developed products or brands, production of our products may be delayed or postponed and/or the availability of some of our products may be reduced or eliminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe ability to distribute our products is subject to significant changes in the availability and pricing of transportation.\nWe utilize third-party carriers to ship our products to our distribution centers and to customers. The availability of timely and reliable transportation and the associated costs are subject to market demand, carrier capacity, fuel prices and regulatory oversight. Our procurement of transportation services from a diversified group of carriers and continuous monitoring of carrier usage and pricing could be insufficient to protect us from changes in market demand or carrier capacity. The inability to distribute our products in a cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nClimate change may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as sugar and wheat. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of transporting and storing raw materials, or disrupt our production schedules. As a result of climate change, we may also be subjected to decreased availability of water, deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIf we lose one or more of our major customers, or if any of our major customers experience significant business interruption, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales. Wal-Mart together with its affiliates is our largest customer and represented approximately 18.9% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cumulatively, including Wal-Mart, our top ten customers accounted for 59.5% of total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nWe do not have long-term supply contracts with any of our major customers. The loss of one or more major customers, a material reduction in sales to these customers for any reason, including but not limited to, a significant business interruption of our customers\u2019 operations or our inability to forecast demand and plan production to fulfill customer orders would result in a decrease in our product sales, financial condition and operating results.\nOur results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased labor and employee-related expenses.\nInflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market have increased and may continue to increase labor costs or constrain production capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition. While we have historically experienced some level of ordinary course turnover of employees, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting actions and impacts have exacerbated labor shortages and increased turnover. A number of factors have had and may continue to have adverse effects on the labor force available to us, including reduced employment pools, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers\u2019 health and safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. Our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits, including health and welfare, and severance benefits. The annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements. Labor shortages and increased turnover rates within our team members have led to and could in the future lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our bakeries or otherwise operate at full capacity. An overall or prolonged labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern our relationships with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include employee classifications as exempt or non-exempt, minimum wage requirements, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, overtime, family leave, safety standards, payroll taxes, citizenship requirements and other wage and benefit requirements for employees classified as non-exempt. As our employees are paid at rates set above, but related to, the applicable minimum wage, further increases in the minimum wage could increase our labor costs. Significant additional government regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA portion of our workforce belongs to unions. Failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or work stoppages could cause our business to suffer.\nApproximately 44% of our employees, as of December 31, 2021, are covered by collective bargaining agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms, which could impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or result in a loss of sales, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy, which could have an adverse effect to our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims should the consumption of any of our products cause injury, illness or death.\nWe sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, mislabeling, product tampering and other adulteration of food products. Consumption of a mislabeled, adulterated, contaminated or spoiled product may result in personal illness or injury. We could be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury, and we could incur liabilities that are not insured or exceed our insurance coverage. Even if product liability claims against us are not successful or fully pursued, these claims could be costly and time consuming and may require our management to spend time defending the claims rather than operating the business. In addition, publicity regarding these claims could adversely affect our reputation and brands.\nProduct recalls may increase our costs, negatively impact our brands\u2019 reputation, and adversely affect our business.\nA product that has been actually or allegedly misbranded or becomes adulterated could result in product withdrawals or recalls, destruction of product inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, substantial cost of compliance or remediation, and potentially significant product liability judgments against us. Any of these events could result in a loss of demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. While we carry insurance to cover the direct costs of such events, we cannot guarantee that these costs will be recovered. We could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in our product quality, safety and integrity generally.\nWe rely on third parties for services related to sales, marketing and distribution.\nWe utilize third-party brokerage and merchandising services and common carriers to execute order fulfillment for the majority of our products. While these services have increased our market penetration and expanded our distribution reach, we are dependent upon these third parties to effectively market, sell and distribute our products. We do not have long-term contracts with any of these third-party service providers. Accordingly, any termination by a third-party provider of their services to us, or any failure by these third parties to perform their obligations to us, would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy, may further disrupt financial markets and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain governmental authorities have issued orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of the pandemic. Additional, more restrictive proclamations and/or directives may be issued in the future. We cannot predict the economic impact of additional waves of COVID-19 infections or governmental measures and directives in response thereto. Although several vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, the effectiveness and public acceptance of the vaccines remain uncertain. While we do not expect that the virus will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results at this time, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that the coronavirus will have due to various uncertainties, including new variants of the virus and their severity, the duration of the outbreak, the economic impact on our customers, and\nactions that may be taken by governmental authorities. We also cannot predict the effects of another wave of COVID-19 or any future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases.\nOur geographic focus makes us particularly vulnerable to economic and other events and trends in North America.\nWe operate in North America and are particularly susceptible to adverse United States regulations, trade policies, economic climate, consumer trends, market fluctuations, including commodity price fluctuations or supply shortages of our ingredients and other production inputs, and other adverse events. The concentration of our businesses in North America could present challenges and may increase the likelihood that an adverse event in the United States would materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and operating results.\nThe consolidation of retail customers could adversely affect us.\nRetail customers may continue to consolidate, resulting in fewer customers for our business. Consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their position to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased promotional programs, or specifically tailored products. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands. Retail consolidation and increased retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nRetail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers\u2019 business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material and adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nOTHER GENERAL RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nUnsuccessful implementation of business strategies to reduce costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our costs, such as freight, raw materials and energy, are subject to factors outside of our control. Therefore, we must seek to reduce costs in other areas, such as through operating efficiency. If we are not able to complete projects designed to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted. In addition, if the cost-saving initiatives we have implemented, or any future cost-saving initiatives, do not generate the expected cost savings and synergies, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nLegal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penalties.\nAs a large food company, we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. Various laws and regulations govern food production, storage, distribution, sales, labeling, advertising and marketing, as well as licensing, trade, labor, tax and environmental matters, and health and safety practices. Government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations. Consequently, we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies and procedures. Moreover, a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. Legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales, reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, worker health, and workplace safety. Costs to comply with these laws and regulations, or claims with respect to environmental, health and safety matters, could have a significant negative impact on our business.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, employee exposure to hazards in the workplace and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits for many of our operations, and sometimes we are required to install pollution control equipment or to implement operational changes to limit air emissions or wastewater discharges and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental releases of hazardous materials.\nWe could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, civil or criminal fines or penalties, and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of any violations of environmental laws and regulations, noncompliance with environmental permit conditions or contamination for which we may be responsible that is identified or that may occur in the future. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases and replenish water. If such laws are enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products.\nUnder federal and state environmental laws, we may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, as well as related costs of investigation and damage to natural resources, at various properties, including our current and former properties and the former properties of our predecessors, as well as off-site waste handling or disposal sites that we or our predecessors have used. Liability may be imposed upon us without regard to whether we knew of or caused the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Any such locations we currently own or occupy, or locations that we may acquire in the future, may result in liability to us under such laws or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits based on alleged conduct or environmental conditions. In addition, we may be liable if hazardous or toxic substances migrate from properties for which we may be responsible to other properties.\nIn addition to regulations applicable to our operations, failure by any of our suppliers to comply with regulations, or allegations of compliance failure, may disrupt their operations and could result in potential liability. Even if we were able to obtain insurance coverage or compensation for any losses or damages resulting from the noncompliance of a supplier with applicable regulations, our brands and reputation may be adversely affected by negative perceptions of our brands stemming from such compliance failures.\nWe cannot predict what environmental or health and safety legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted. We also cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with such environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or to respond to environmental claims. These potential expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur operations are subject to regulation by the FDA, FTC and other governmental entities, and such regulations are subject to change from time to time which could impact how we manage our production and sale of products.\nOur and our contract manufacturers\u2019 operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the FTC and other national, state, and local authorities in the U.S., as well as the CFIA and provincial and local authorities in Canada. For example, we are subject to the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d) and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the registration of all points in the food supply chain, manufacturing, processing, composition and ingredients, labeling, packaging, holding, distribution and safety of food. Under this program, the FDA regulates manufacturing practices for foods through, among other things, its current \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d regulations, or cGMPs, and specifies the ingredients for certain foods. Our bakeries and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state, and local authorities. The Food Safety Modernization Act increased the number of inspections at food facilities in the United States in an effort to enhance the detection of food-borne illness outbreaks and order recalls of tainted food products. It also imposes greater responsibility upon parties throughout the food chain to design and implement effective\nhazard analysis and preventive control programs in food safety programs throughout the supply chain. Failure to follow cGMPs and have an adequate food safety program results in food being adulterated and could require product recalls. The FDCA requires certain reports of hazardous food products to be submitted to the FDA and provides authority to the FDA to take corrective action including recall of adulterated or misbranded food products.\nSimilarly, the bakery in Burlington, Ontario is subject to the Canadian Food and Drugs Act (\u201cCFDA\u201d) and the Safe Food for Canadian\u2019s Act (\u201cSFCA\u201d) and regulations promulgated thereunder by Health Canada and the CFIA. The CFDA and SFCA govern the import, export, manufacture, distribution, composition, packaging, labelling, advertising, and sale of food products in Canada. Under the SFCA, the CFIA, among other things, issues licenses for the importation, manufacturing, processing, packaging and labelling of foods, and enforces requirements for food safety, preventive controls, traceability, and product complaints, investigations and recalls. Failure to implement appropriate preventive controls and have an adequate food safety program may result in food being unsafe and could require product recalls. Under the SFCA, companies are required to report to the CFIA if a food presents a risk of injury to human health, whether due to adulteration or misbranding, and CFIA has authority to take corrective action including recall of the affected food products.\nThe FDA also has extensive and specific regulations concerning food labeling, including use of certain terms such as sugar free, healthy, low sodium and low fat. Improper labeling of a food causes it to be misbranded and could result in a recall. Under the FDCA, the FDA can issue a Warning Letter or Untitled Letter, or take other regulatory action such as a product seizure and detention, product recall, refuse to allow the export of the product, or with the Department of Justice, criminal or civil penalties, injunction against or restriction of product manufacture or distribution, consent decrees, disgorgement, restitution, against misbranded or adulterated food products. The FTC and state authorities regulate how we market and advertise our products, and we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. In Canada, the CFIA enforces the detailed labelling and advertising requirements and restrictions promulgated under the CFDA and the SFCA, and has broad authority to take regulatory action such as product seizure and detention, stop sale, product recall, license suspension, impose administrative monetary penalties or pursue criminal prosecution for noncompliant food product or food advertising that is allegedly false or deceptive. Changes in these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions, causing our financial condition and operating results to be adversely affected.\nWe seek to comply with applicable laws and regulations through a combination of employing internal personnel to ensure quality-assurance and food safety programs compliance and contracting with third-party laboratories. Compliance with regulations is costly and time-consuming. From time to time, we have been subject to civil claims alleging that we failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Any failure to comply or maintain permits and licenses relating to our operations could subject us to fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions or suspensions or revocations of our registration, permits or licenses, which could result in increased operating costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSignificant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may reduce demand for such products and could adversely affect our business or operating results.\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products and have also prohibited or limited the use of certain words or phrases in connection with describing a product\u2019s qualities. For example, in California, Proposition 65 requires a specific warning on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level. We have been subject to civil claims alleging non-compliance with these requirements and may be subject to such claims in the future.\nIn addition, the United States imposed nutrition labeling regulations that required large food manufacturers to declare the quantity of added sugar by January 1, 2020, as well as a national bio-engineered food disclosure standard that required food manufacturers to disclose bio-engineered food ingredients by January 1, 2022. Our new product labeling may impact the consumption and public perception of our products.\nThe imposition or proposed imposition of additional product labeling or warning requirements could reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based in scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs. Such factors could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and operating results.\nA material impairment in the carrying value of acquired goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth.\nA significant portion of our assets are goodwill and other intangible assets, the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually and more often if indicators of impairment exist. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired, and this would result in a non-cash charge to earnings, which could be material. Events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our Class A common stock, increased competition or loss of market share, obsolescence, product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life, deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems, most of which are managed by third-party service providers. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and operating results to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, the potential effects of climate change, power outages, systems failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, and other events that could have a security impact. We invest to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber-attacks. We believe our security processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches. Nevertheless, despite continued vigilance in these areas, disruptions in information technology systems, including unauthorized use of data, are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation. Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber-attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our operations, our employees and those with whom we do business. This in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse workforce or manage changes in our workforce.\nWe must hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse workforce. We compete to hire new personnel in the many regions in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies. Unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or hire and retain a diverse workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness.\nWe also face increased personnel-related risks. These risks could lead to operational challenges, including increased competition for employees with the skills we require to achieve our business goals, and higher employee turnover, including employees with key capabilities. Furthermore, we might be unable to manage changes in, or that affect, our workforce appropriately or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees. These risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation, ability to meet the needs of our customers, product sales, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total balance on long term debt, excluding deferred financing charges, discount, premium, and lease obligations, was $1,091.6 million. Our degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities or to pay dividends;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because the portion of our borrowings not hedged by swap agreements are subject to variable rates;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022subjecting us to restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility in operating our business;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nDespite our significant leverage, we may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage.\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and/or cash flows.\nOur term loan and revolving line of credit bear interest at variable interest rates that use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark rate. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority and the administrator of LIBOR have announced that the publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR setting will cease to be published or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023 and the publication of all other LIBOR settings will cease to be published as of December 31, 2021. Starting January 1, 2022, banks in the United States have ceased entering into new credit and other contractual agreements using U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate, and instead began incorporating alternative reference rates such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), within such agreements. SOFR is observed and backward-looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). Although our credit agreement provides for successor base rates, the successor base rates may be related to LIBOR, and the consequences of any potential cessation, modification or other reform of LIBOR cannot be predicted at this time. We work to reduce our exposure to LIBOR through swap contracts which effectively fix a portion of our variable-rate interest payments. Our interest expense may increase, and our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and growth.\nWe may require additional financing to fund our operations or growth. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our continued development or growth. None of our officers, directors or stockholders are required to provide any financing to us.\nOur only significant asset is our ownership interest in our operating subsidiaries and such ownership may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock or satisfy our other financial obligations, including our obligations under the tax receivable agreement.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than our ownership interest in our operating subsidiaries. We depend on our operating subsidiaries for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including our expenses as a publicly traded company, to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock, and to satisfy our obligations under the tax receivable agreement. See Note 9. Tax Receivable Agreement to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information on the tax receivable agreement. The financial condition and operating requirements of our operating subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our operating subsidiaries. The earnings from, or other available assets of, our operating subsidiaries may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock or satisfy our other financial obligations, including our obligations under the tax receivable agreement.\nThe ability of our operating subsidiaries (other than subsidiaries which have been designated as unrestricted pursuant to our ability to do so in certain limited circumstances) to make distributions, loans and other payments to us for the purposes described above and for any other purpose are governed by the terms of our credit facilities and will be subject to the negative covenants set forth therein. Any loans or other extensions of credit will be subject to the investment covenants contained therein, which provide for several exceptions including, among others (i) a general investment basket equal to the greater of a fixed dollar amount and a percentage of EBITDA and (ii) an unlimited investment basket based on satisfying a total net leverage ratio on a pro forma basis. Similarly, any dividends, distributions or similar payments will be subject to the dividends and distributions covenant under such credit facilities, which also provide for several exceptions including, among others (i) for payment of overhead and certain fees and expenses of parent companies, (ii) for tax distributions, subject to certain limitations, (iii) a general dividend and distribution basket equal to the greater of a fixed dollar amount and a percentage of EBITDA and (iv) an unlimited dividend and distribution basket based on satisfying a total net leverage ratio on a pro forma basis.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Purchases or sales of large quantities of our stock, or significant short positions in our stock could have an unusual or adverse effect on our market price. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to periodically enter the market in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. Abnormal trading activity, including activity that is considered market manipulation, can lead to irrational and/or temporary movements in the price of our Class A common stock, which, in turn, may increase its risk and volatility. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our Class A common stock will be stable or appreciate over time.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. These provisions include:\n\u2022no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022the right of our board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting and the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members of our board, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a meeting of stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE AMENDMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED REPORTS\nThe restatement of certain of our financial statements may subject us to risks and uncertainties, including the increased possibility of legal proceedings.\nOn April 30, 2021, management and the audit committee of our Board of Directors determined that our previously issued quarterly and year-to-date unaudited consolidated financial statements for March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020, December 31, 2020 and our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ending December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 should no longer be relied upon. In addition, we determined that the related press releases, earnings releases, and investor communications describing our financial statements for these periods should no longer be relied upon. The errors identified were non-cash and related to our classification of certain outstanding warrants. Accordingly, we restated the annual, quarterly and year-to-date audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements for the foregoing periods on May 17, 2021.\nAs a result of our restatement, we may become subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the increased possibility of legal proceedings or a review by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. The costs of defending against such legal proceedings or administrative actions could be significant. In addition, we could face monetary judgments, penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.", "PERMNO": 15785, "SIC": 2050, "TIC": "TWNK"}
