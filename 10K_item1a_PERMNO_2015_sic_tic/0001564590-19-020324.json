{"cik": "90896", "company": "Skyline Champion Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-05-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves a number of risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. The items described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe factory-built housing industry is cyclical, is affected by seasonality and is sensitive to changes in general economic or other business conditions.\nThe factory-built housing industry is affected by seasonality. Sales during the period from March to November are typically higher than in other months. As a result, the Company\u2019s sales and operating results sometimes fluctuate and may continue to fluctuate in the future.\nThe factory-built housing industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as employment rates, job growth, population growth, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, interest rate levels and an oversupply of homes for sale. Changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where the Company operates, could reduce demand and constrain pricing for new factory-built homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending shipments. Reductions in the number of homes shipped by the Company or constraints on the prices it can charge, could result in a decrease in the Company\u2019s net sales and earnings, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to demand fluctuations in the housing industry. Reductions in demand could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s homes is subject to fluctuations in the housing market generally. In a housing market downturn, the Company\u2019s sales and results of operations could be adversely affected; it may have significant inventory impairments and other write-offs; its gross margins may decline significantly from historical levels; and it may incur losses from operations. The Company cannot predict the continuation of the current housing recovery, nor can it provide assurance that should the recovery not continue its response will be successful.\nFuture increases in interest rates, more stringent credit standards, tightening of financing terms, or other increases in the effective costs of owning a factory-built home (including those related to regulation or other government actions) could limit the purchasing power of the Company\u2019s potential customers and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nA large majority of the Company\u2019s customers finance their home purchases through third-party lenders. While interest rates have increased moderately, they have been near historical lows for several years, which has made purchasing new factory-built homes more affordable. Increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of consumer financing could adversely affect the market for homes. Potential customers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain financing. Lenders may increase the qualifications needed for financing or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk. These factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of the Company\u2019s factory-built homes. These developments have historically had, and may once again have, an adverse effect on the overall demand for factory-built housing and its competitiveness with other forms of housing, and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe liquidity provided by GSEs and the FHA is also critical in insuring or purchasing home mortgages and creating or insuring investment securities that are either sold to investors or held in their portfolios. The impact of the federal government\u2019s conservatorship of GSEs on the short-term and long-term demand for new housing as well as any potential restructuring of the GSEs remains unclear. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates, financing, and the Company\u2019s sales of new homes.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) to regulate consumer financial products and services. Since 2014, the CFPB has promulgated rules concerning consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling, which include real property mortgages and chattel loans (financed without land) secured by factory-built homes. The rules have caused some lenders to curtail underwriting such loans, and some investors are reluctant to own or participate in owning such loans because of the uncertainty of potential litigation and other costs. Consequently, such regulatory developments could cause some prospective buyers of factory-built homes to be unable to secure the financing necessary to complete purchases. In addition, compliance with the law and ongoing rule implementation has caused lenders to incur additional costs to implement new processes, procedures, controls, and infrastructure required to comply with the regulations. Compliance may constrain lenders\u2019 ability to profitably price certain loans. Failure to comply with these regulations, changes in these or other regulations, or the imposition of additional regulations, could affect the Company\u2019s earnings, limit its access to capital, and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nThe CFPB rules amending the Truth in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act expand the types of mortgage loans that are subject to the protections of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (\u201cHOEPA\u201d), revise and expand the tests for coverage under HOEPA, and impose additional restrictions on mortgages that are covered by HOEPA. As a result, certain factory-built home loans are now subject to HOEPA limits on interest rates and fees. Loans with rates or fees in excess of the limits are deemed \u201chigh cost mortgages\u201d and provide additional protections for borrowers, including with respect to determining the value of the home. Most loans for the purchase of factory-built homes have been written at rates and fees that would not appear to be considered high cost mortgages under the rule. Although some lenders may continue to offer loans that are now deemed high cost mortgages, the rate and fee limits appear to have deterred some lenders from offering loans to certain borrowers and may continue to make them reluctant to enter into loans subject to the provisions of HOEPA. As a result, some prospective buyers of factory-built homes may be unable to secure financing necessary to complete factory-built home purchases.\nThe availability of wholesale financing for retailers is limited due to a limited number of floor plan lenders and reduced lending limits.\nFactory-built housing retailers generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesale floor plan financing provided by lending institutions. The availability of wholesale financing is significantly affected by the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits. Limited availability of floor plan lending negatively affects the inventory levels of the Company\u2019s independent retailers, the number of retail sales center locations and related wholesale demand, and adversely affects the availability of and access to capital on an ongoing basis. As a result, if the availability of wholesale financing is reduced, the Company could experience sales declines or a higher level of customer defaults and its operating results and cash flows could suffer.\nThe Company has contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industry retailers.\nAs is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s manufacturing sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan agreements with financing companies. In connection with the floor plan financing programs, the Company generally has separate agreements with the financing companies that require the Company to repurchase homes upon default by the retailer and repossession of the homes by the financing companies. These repurchase agreements are applicable for various periods of time, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. However, certain homes are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. The Company\u2019s contingent repurchase obligation as of March 30, 2019, was estimated to be approximately $173.4 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. The Company may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incur additional expense and reduced cash flows because of these repurchase agreements.\nIf the Company is unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent distributors who sell its homes, the Company\u2019s sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer.\nAlthough the Company maintains its own factory direct retail business in select markets, it conducts a majority of its business through independent distributors. For example, over 90% of the Company\u2019s shipments of homes in fiscal 2019 were made to independent distributors throughout the United States and western Canada. The Company may not be able to establish relationships with new independent distributors or maintain good relationships with independent distributors that sell its homes. Even if the Company does establish and maintain relationships with independent distributors, these customers are not obligated to sell the Company\u2019s homes exclusively and may choose to sell competitors\u2019 homes instead. The independent distributors with whom the Company has relationships can cancel these relationships on short notice. In addition, these customers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to similar industry, economic, demographic and seasonal trends that the Company faces. If the Company does not establish and maintain relationships with solvent independent distributors in the markets it serves, sales in those markets could decline, and if the Company cannot effect offsetting expansion of its factory-direct retail business, the Company\u2019s operating results and cash flows could suffer.\nPrices of certain materials can fluctuate and availability of certain materials may be limited at times.\nPrices of certain materials used in the construction of homes, such as lumber, insulation, steel, drywall, oil-based products and fuel, can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Additionally, availability of certain materials such as drywall and insulation may be limited at times, resulting in higher prices or the need to find alternative suppliers. The Company may attempt to pass the higher material costs on to customers, but it is not certain that it will be able to achieve this without affecting demand. Limited availability of materials may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s production capabilities and results of operations.\nFor some of the components used in production, the Company depends on a small group of suppliers and the loss of any of these suppliers could affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in a timely manner or at competitive prices, which would decrease its sales and profit margins. Some components are sourced from foreign sources and delays in obtaining these components or the imposition of new or additional tariffs could result in increased costs and decreased sales and profit margins.\nThe Company depends on timely and sufficient delivery of components from its suppliers. Most components are readily available from a variety of sources. However, a few key components are currently produced by only a small group of quality suppliers that have the capacity to supply large quantities. Some of these components are foreign sourced and their supply is subject to disruption from government actions. If the Company cannot obtain an adequate supply of these key components its sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages and turnover.\nThe homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced labor shortages and other labor-related issues. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to the Company and its subcontractors in one or more of its markets, including high employment levels, construction market conditions, and government regulation, which include laws and regulations related to workers\u2019 health and safety, wage and hour practices, and immigration. The Company\u2019s direct labor has historically experienced high turnover rates, which can lead to increased spending on training and retention and, as a result, increased costs of production. An overall labor shortage or a lack of skilled labor could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction of homes, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s net sales and results of operations.\nIndustry conditions and future operating results could limit the Company\u2019s sources of capital. If the Company is unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed, it may be unable to maintain or expand its business.\nThe Company depends on its cash balances, cash flows from operations, and its revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) to finance its operating requirements, capital expenditures, and other needs. If the Company\u2019s cash balances, cash flows from operations, and availability under the Credit Facility are insufficient to finance its operations and alternative capital is not available, the Company may not be able to expand its business and make acquisitions, or it may need to curtail or limit its existing operations.\nFactory-built housing operates in the highly competitive housing industry, and, if other home builders are more successful or offer better value to the Company\u2019s customers, the Company\u2019s business could decline.\nThe Company operates in a very competitive environment and faces competition from a number of other home builders in each market in which it operates. The Company competes with large national and regional home building companies and with smaller local home builders for financing, raw materials, and skilled management and labor resources. Some of the Company\u2019s manufacturing competitors have captive retail distribution systems and consumer finance and insurance operations. In addition, there are independent factory-built housing retail locations that sell competitors\u2019 products in most areas where the Company\u2019s homes are sold and in most areas where it has retail operations. Because barriers to entry to the industry at both the manufacturing and retail levels are low, the Company believes that it is relatively easy for new competitors to enter its markets. In addition, the Company\u2019s products compete within the housing industry more broadly with other forms of low to moderate-cost housing, including site-built homes, panelized homes, apartments, townhouses, condominiums, and repossessed homes. The Company also competes with resale homes, also referred to as \u201cpreviously owned\u201d or \u201cexisting\u201d homes, as well as rental housing.\nAn oversupply of homes available for sale or the heavy discounting of home prices by the Company\u2019s competitors could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s homes and the results of its operations. An increase in competitive conditions could have any of the following impacts on the Company: delivering fewer homes; sale of fewer homes or higher cancellations by the Company\u2019s home buyers; an increase in selling incentives or reduction of prices; and realization of lower gross margins due to lower selling prices or an inability to increase selling prices to offset increased costs of the homes delivered. If the Company is unable to compete effectively in its markets, its business could decline disproportionately to that of its competitors. As a result, its sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer.\nChanges in consumer preferences for the Company\u2019s products or its failure to gauge those preferences could lead to reduced sales.\nThe Company cannot be certain that historical consumer preferences for factory-built homes in general, and for its products in particular, will remain unchanged. The Company\u2019s ability to remain competitive depends heavily on its ability to provide a continuing and timely introduction of innovative product offerings. The Company believes that the introduction of new features, designs, and models will be critical to the future success of its operations. Managing frequent product introductions poses inherent risks. Delays in the introduction or market acceptance of new models, designs, or product features could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Products may not be accepted for a number of reasons, including changes in consumer preferences or the Company\u2019s failure to properly gauge consumer preferences. Further, the Company cannot be certain that new product introductions will not reduce net sales from existing models and adversely affect its results of operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s net sales may be adversely affected if its new models and products are not introduced to the market on time or are not successful when introduced. Finally, the Company\u2019s competitors\u2019 new products may obtain better market acceptance.\nWhen the Company introduces new products into the marketplace, it may incur expenses that it did not anticipate, which, in turn, can result in reduced earnings.\nThe introduction of new models, floor plans, and features are critical to the Company\u2019s future success, however, the Company may incur unexpected expenses when it makes such introductions. For example, it may experience unexpected engineering or design flaws that may cause increased warranty costs. The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and could have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s earnings. Estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of product sale to reflect the Company\u2019s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products. An increase in actual warranty claims costs as compared to the Company\u2019s estimates could result in increased warranty reserves and expense which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and gross margin and could harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s products contain thousands of parts, many of which are supplied by a network of approved vendors. Product defects may occur, including components purchased from material vendors. The Company cannot assure that all such defects will be detected prior to the distribution of its products. In addition, although the Company endeavors to compel suppliers to maintain appropriate levels of insurance coverage, it cannot assure that if a defect in a vendor-supplied part were to occur that the vendor would have the ability to financially rectify the defect. Failure to detect defects in the Company\u2019s products, including vendor-supplied parts, could result in lost revenue, increased warranty and related costs, and could harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nIf the factory-built housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, the Company\u2019s sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer.\nLimitations on the number of sites available for placement of factory-built homes or on the operation of factory-built housing communities could reduce the demand for factory-built homes and, as a result, the Company\u2019s sales. Factory-built housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning ordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways. In the past, some property owners have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting the use of factory-built homes in residential areas, which the Company believes has restricted the growth of the industry. Factory-built homes may not receive widespread acceptance and localities may not adopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of factory-built home communities. If the factory-built housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, the Company\u2019s sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer.\nThe Company may not be able to manage its business effectively if it cannot retain current management team members or if it is unable to attract and motivate key personnel.\nOur success depends on upon the skills, experience, and active participation of our senior management and key employees, including at our Titan Factory Direct and Star Fleet Trucking operations, many of whom have been with the Company for a significant number of years. In May 2019, we announced that our Chief Executive Officer, Keith Anderson, will retire on June 1 and will be succeeded by Mark Yost, our current Executive Vice President and President of U.S. Operations. This transition, in the Company\u2019s senior management team or other key employees, as well any future changes may result in operational disruptions and changes to the strategy of Company\u2019s business, so the Company\u2019s business may be harmed as a result. The Company\u2019s business could be further disrupted and harmed if we were unable to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis following future departures.\nThe Company may not be able to attract or motivate qualified management and operations personnel in the future. If the Company is not able to attract and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish its business objectives, it will experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of its objectives. The Company may also have difficulty attracting experienced personnel and may be required to expend significant financial resources in its employee recruitment efforts.\nProduct liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nAs a home builder, the Company is subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the home building industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be restricted and become more costly. If the limits or coverages of the Company\u2019s current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or the Company is not able to obtain adequate, or reasonably priced insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, the Company may experience losses that could negatively impact its financial results.\nThe Company records expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover its self-insured liability under its insurance policies, and estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above its coverage limits or that are not covered by its insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of the Company\u2019s historical claims and industry data, and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Due to the degree of judgment required and the potential for variability in the underlying assumptions when deriving estimated liabilities, the Company\u2019s actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to its consolidated financial statements.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company\u2019s information and expose it to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business, it collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, its proprietary business information and that of its suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of its customers and employees. The Company also has outsourced elements of its information technology structure, and as a result, it is managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to the Company\u2019s confidential information. Similarly, the Company\u2019s business partners and other third party providers possess certain of its sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to the Company\u2019s operations and business strategy. Despite its security measures, the Company\u2019s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. The Company, its partners, vendors, and other third party providers could be susceptible to third party attacks on the Company\u2019s, and their, information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including criminal groups. Any such breach could compromise the Company\u2019s networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, and damage its reputation, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing, which could adversely affect its profitability.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with such laws and regulations could expose it to a wide variety of sanctions, including closing one or more manufacturing facilities. Regulatory matters affecting the Company\u2019s operations are under regular review by governmental bodies and the Company cannot predict what effect, if any, new laws and regulations would have on it or the factory-built housing industry. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nThe cost of operations could be adversely impacted by increased costs of healthcare benefits provided to employees.\nIn 2010, the Affordable Care Act, was passed into law. As enacted, the health reform law changes, among other things, certain aspects of health insurance. The Affordable Care Act, coupled with the uncertainty in the insurance markets associated with the future of the Act, could increase the Company\u2019s healthcare costs, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s earnings.\nA prolonged delay by Congress and the President to approve budgets or continuing appropriation resolutions to facilitate the operations of the federal government could delay the completion of home sales or cause cancellations, and thereby negatively impact the Company\u2019s deliveries and revenues.\nCongress and the President may not timely approve budgets or appropriation legislation to facilitate the operations of the federal government, as was the case with the government shut-down that ended January 25, 2019. As a result, many federal agencies have historically and may again cease or curtail some activities. The affected activities include Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) verification of loan applicants\u2019 tax return information, the funding of orders by the FEMA as part of its disaster relief efforts, and approvals by the FHA and other government agencies to fund or insure mortgage loans under programs that these agencies operate. As many of the Company\u2019s home buyers use these programs to obtain financing to purchase its homes, and many lenders require ongoing coordination with these and other governmental entities to originate home loans, a prolonged delay in the performance of their activities could prevent prospective qualified buyers of its homes from obtaining the loans they need to complete such purchases, which could lead to delays or cancellations of home sales. These and other affected governmental bodies could cause interruptions in various aspects of the Company\u2019s business and investments. Depending on the length of disruption, such factors could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in the after-tax costs of owning a factory-built home could prevent potential customers from buying the Company\u2019s products and adversely affect its business or financial results.\nSignificant expenses of owning a factory-built home, including mortgage interest expenses and real estate taxes, generally were, under prior tax law, deductible expenses for an individual\u2019s federal, and in some cases state, income taxes, subject to certain limitations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in December 2017, includes provisions that would impose limitations with respect to these income tax deductions. Increases in property tax rates or fees on developers by local governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding or to fund local initiatives, such as funding schools or road improvements, or increases in insurance premiums can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes, and can have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nThe transportation industry is subject to government regulation, and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results or financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s Star Fleet Trucking subsidiary provides transportation services. The transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes, including potential limits on carbon emissions under climate change legislation and Department of Transportation regulations regarding, among other things, driver breaks, classification of independent drivers, \u201crestart\u201d rules, and the use of electronic logging devices that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. The Company may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions or limits on vehicle weight and size. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or increase the cost of providing transportation services, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nNatural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs, and decrease demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay factory-built home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials, and negatively impact the demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. Furthermore, if the Company\u2019s insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, the Company\u2019s earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected.\nChanges in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s investments in Canada and cause foreign exchange losses.\nThe Company has substantial investments in businesses in Canada. Unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s investments in these businesses.\nFollowing completion of the secondary offering of our common stock on September 25, 2018, the Company is no longer a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under NYSE rules. However, the Company will continue to qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to our shareholders during a one-year transition period.\nFollowing the completion of the secondary offering of our common stock on September 25, 2018, affiliates of Bain Capital Credit, L.P., Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and MAK Capital (collectively, the \u201cPrincipal Shareholders\u201d) ceased to control a majority of the voting power of our common stock. As a result, the Company is no longer a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards.\nConsequently, the NYSE rules will require that the Company (i) have a majority of independent directors on its board of directors within one year after the date the Company no longer qualified as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d; (ii) have compensation and nominating and governance committees composed entirely of independent directors within one year of such date; and (iii) perform an annual performance evaluation of the compensation and nominating and governance committees.\nDuring this transition period, we will continue to qualify for and may continue to utilize the available exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements as permitted by NYSE rules. Accordingly, during the transition period, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements, which could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nAnti-takeover provisions in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could prohibit a change of control that the Company\u2019s shareholders may favor and could negatively affect the Company\u2019s stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of the Company, even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of the Company\u2019s shareholders. These provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by the Company\u2019s shareholders to replace or remove the Company\u2019s management. For example, the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws:\n\u2022\npermit the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as they determine, without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominations; and\n\u2022\ncontain limitations on convening shareholder meetings and shareholder action by written consent.\nThese provisions make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirers to acquire the Company without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe integration of Skyline and Champion Holdings may not be successful or the anticipated benefits from their combination may not be realized in their entirety.\nFollowing the consummation of the Exchange contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, the Company\u2019s management has been integrating the operations, as well as financial and other systems, of Skyline and Champion Holdings. The Company\u2019s management has been, and will continue to be, required to devote a great deal of time and attention to the process of integrating the operations while carrying on the ongoing operations. A significant degree of difficulty and management involvement is inherent in the integration process. The integration process includes but is not limited to:\n\u2022\nintegrating the operations while carrying on the ongoing business;\n\u2022\ncreating uniform policies, procedures, standards, internal controls, and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters;\n\u2022\nintegrating information technology, purchasing, accounting, sales, payroll and regulatory compliance systems;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; and\n\u2022\nintegrating two business cultures, which may prove to be incompatible.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be successful or cost effective at integrating the two companies. The integration may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in the activities of the business after the consummation of the Exchange. If the Company\u2019s management is unable to manage the integration process effectively, or any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, the Company\u2019s business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even if the Company is able to combine the two business operations successfully, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits of the expected synergies, which are expected to result from the Exchange, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is expected. For example, the benefits from the Exchange may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies. If the Company fails to realize the benefits it anticipates from the Exchange, the business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company incurs substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company, and the Company\u2019s management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, the Company currently incurs substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. The Company\u2019s management devotes both time and financial resources to these compliance initiatives.\nIf the Company fails to staff its accounting and finance functions adequately, or fails to maintain internal controls adequate to meet the demands that are placed upon it as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or in a timely manner and our business and stock price may suffer. The costs of being a public company, as well as diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future business.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that the Company would prevent or detect a misstatement of its financial statements or fraud. Skyline identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2017 as it relates to the accuracy and valuation of its inventory. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company has completed remediation measures on this material weakness. The Company is performing initial testing of the internal control framework for Champion Holdings and these activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements.\nThe Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company currently intends to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to fund the development and growth of the Company\u2019s business. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, if any, will be investors\u2019 only source of gain on an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends to shareholders will be at the sole discretion of the Company\u2019s board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including general economic conditions, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, the Company\u2019s available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders or by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to the Company and any other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant.\nAn impairment of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our operating results and net worth.\nAs of March 30, 2019, 25% of our total assets consisted of goodwill, all of which is allocated to reporting units included in the U.S. Factory-Built Housing segment. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"), we test goodwill at least annually for impairment or more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If goodwill has become impaired, we charge the impairment as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurred. See Item 7,\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies\" and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A write off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 38850, "SIC": 2451, "TIC": "SKY"}
