RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to Our LED Business\nIf LED lighting technology fails to gain widespread market acceptance or we are unable to respond effectively as new lighting technologies and market trends emerge, our competitive position and our ability to generate revenue and profits may be harmed.\nTo be successful, we depend on continued market acceptance of our existing LED technology. Although adoption of LED lighting continues to grow, the use of LED lighting products for general illumination is in its early stages, is still limited and faces significant challenges. Potential customers may be reluctant to adopt LED lighting products as an alternative to traditional lighting technology because of its higher initial cost or perceived risks relating to its novelty, reliability, usefulness, light quality and cost-effectiveness when compared to other established lighting sources available in the market. Changes in economic and market conditions may also affect the marketability of some traditional lighting technologies such as declining energy prices in certain regions or countries may favor existing lighting technologies that are less energy efficient, reducing the rate of adoption for LED lighting products in those areas. Even if LED lighting products continue to achieve performance improvements and cost reductions, limited customer awareness of the benefits of LED lighting products, lack of widely accepted standards governing LED lighting products and customer unwillingness to adopt LED lighting products in favor of entrenched solutions could significantly limit the demand for LED lighting products and adversely impact our results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. An economic downturn may adversely impact our business. Slow growth in the economy or an economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to meet our working capital requirements and growth objectives, or could otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, any general or market-specific economic downturns, particularly those affecting building renovation, or that cause end-users to reduce or delay their purchases of lighting products, services, or retrofit activities, would have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to factors that are difficult to forecast and not within our control.\nOur past operating results may not be accurate indicators of future performance, and you should not rely on such results to predict our future performance. Our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past, and could fluctuate in the future. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations include:\n\u25cf\nchanges in aggregate capital spending, cyclicality and other economic conditions, or domestic and international demand in the industries we serve;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of large customer orders;\n\u25cf\nour ability to effectively manage our working capital;\n\u25cf\nour ability to satisfy customer demands in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u25cf\nour inability to adjust certain fixed costs and expenses for changes in demand;\n\u25cf\nseasonal fluctuations in demand and our revenue; and\nIf we are unable to manage any future growth effectively, our profitability and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to achieve our desired growth depends on our execution in functional areas such as management, sales and marketing, and general administration and operations. To manage any future growth, we must continue to improve our product development, distribution, operational and financial processes and systems and expand, train and manage our employee base. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to effectively develop, manage and expand our distribution channels for our products, our operating results may suffer.\nWe have expanded into business channels that are different from those in which we have historically operated as we grow our business and sell LED lighting products. If we are unable to effectively penetrate these channels or develop alternate channels to ensure our products are reaching the appropriate customer base, our financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, if we successfully penetrate or develop these channels, we cannot guarantee that customers will accept our products or that we will be able to deliver them in the timeline established by our customers.\nWe intend to sell a portion of our products to sub-distributors. We will rely on sub-distributors to develop and expand their customer base as well as anticipate demand from their customers. If they are not successful, our growth and profitability may be adversely impacted. Distributors must balance the need to have enough products in stock in order to meet their customers\u2019 needs against their internal target inventory levels and the risk of potential inventory obsolescence.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and have evolving technical requirements. If we are not able to compete effectively against companies with greater resources, our prospects for future success will be jeopardized.\nThe lighting industry is highly competitive. Management expects competition to intensify in the future. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources. The markets for our products are highly competitive. In the LED market, we compete with companies that manufacture or sell LED chips and LED components as well as those that sell LED lighting products. Competitors continue to offer new LED products with aggressive pricing and improved performance. Competitive pricing pressures may change and could impact our gross margins.\nMoreover, we encounter competition from an even greater number of companies in the general lighting market. Our competitors also include the large, established companies in the general lighting industry, such as General Electric Company, Osram Sylvania, CREE, Inc. and Royal Philips Electronics. Each of these competitors offers lighting products utilizing LED technology. These companies have global marketing capabilities and substantially greater resources to devote to research and development and other aspects of the development, manufacture and marketing of LED lighting products than we possess. The relatively low barriers to entry into the lighting industry and the limited proprietary nature of many lighting products also permit new competitors to enter the industry easily.\nWe operate in an industry that is subject to significant fluctuation in supply and demand that affects our LED revenue and profitability.\nThe LED lighting industry is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life-cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. The industry has experienced significant fluctuations, often in connection with, or in anticipation of product cycles and declines in general economic conditions. These fluctuations have been characterized by lower product demand, production overcapacity, higher inventory levels and increased pricing pressure.\nThe adoption of or changes in government and/or industry policies, standards or regulations relating to the efficiency, performance or other aspects of LED lighting or changes in government and/or industry policies, standards or regulations that discourage the use of certain traditional lighting technologies, could impact the demand for our LED products.\nThe adoption of or changes in government and/or industry policies, standards or regulations relating to the efficiency, performance or other aspects of LED lighting may impact the demand for our LED products.\nDemand for our LED products may also be impacted by changes in government and/or industry policies, standards or regulations that discourage the use of certain traditional lighting technologies. For example, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States imposed constraints on the sale of incandescent lights which began in 2012. These constraints may be eliminated or delayed by legislative action, which could have a negative impact on demand for our products.\nIntegration of acquired businesses may be difficult to achieve and will consume significant financial and managerial resources which may adversely affect operations.\nA very significant part of our strategy to increase revenue and market share is to grow through strategic acquisitions in order to complement and expand our business. During 2014 we acquired ALD and ESCO. These acquisitions involve risks related to the integration of operations and personnel of separate companies. The integration of these businesses will be a complex, time-consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner.\nWe may encounter substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in integrating the operations recently acquired, including:\n\u25cf\nexposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies or its assets;\n\u25cf\npotential constraints of management resources;\n\u25cf\ninability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cf\nloss of key employees and/or the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other ongoing business concerns.\nThe geographic distance between the companies and their respective offices and operations increases the risk that the integration will not be completed successfully or in a timely and cost-effective manner. We may not successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the integration of the companies.\nIf we fail to raise additional capital, including from sales revenues, loans or other external funding sources, we may be required to change our planned business strategies.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing on favorable terms, we may not be able to successfully develop and market our products and services. As a result, we would need to curtail business operations, which would have a material negative effect on operating results, the value of our outstanding stock is likely to fall, and our business may fail, causing our stockholders to lose their entire investments.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions in the past and may do so in the future, which may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and existing business.\nWe may continue to expand our business through strategic acquisitions as we have in the past. The success of any acquisition will depend on, among other things:\n\u25cf\nthe availability of suitable candidates;\n\u25cf\nhigher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;\n\u25cf\ncompetition from other companies for the purchase of available candidates;\n\u25cf\nour ability to value those candidates accurately and negotiate favorable terms for those acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of funds to finance acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to establish new informational, operational and financial systems to meet the needs of our business;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to achieve anticipated synergies, including with respect to complementary products or services; and\n\u25cf\nthe availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the acquired businesses.\nWe may not be successful in effectively integrating acquired businesses and completing acquisitions in the future. We also may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time. Acquired businesses may fail to meet our performance expectations. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition as rapidly as expected, or at all, investors or analysts may not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do.\nOur acquisitions could result in future impairment charges and other charges which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a result of our acquisitions of ALD and ESCOI and in consideration of future acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets have been and will be recorded. At the purchase date, the recorded amounts for goodwill and other intangible assets represent fair values estimated at a point in time and are based on valuations that require significant estimates and assumptions about future events, which are derived from information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses and our business plans for the acquired businesses or intellectual property. If estimates and assumptions used to initially record goodwill and intangible assets do not materialize, ongoing reviews of the carrying amounts of such goodwill and intangible assets may result in impairments which will require us to record a charge in the period in which such an impairment is identified. Such charge could have a severe negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The following factors also could result in material charges that would adversely affect our results:\n\u25cf\nChanges to our contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition;\n\u25cf\nAccrual of newly identified pre-acquisition contingent liabilities, in which case the related charge could be required to be included in earnings in the period in which the accrual is determined to the extent it is identified subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation; and\nCustomers may be unable to obtain financing to make purchases from us.\nSome of our customers require financing in order to purchase our products. The potential inability of these customers to access the capital needed to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our customers become insolvent due to market and economic conditions or otherwise, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe reduction or elimination of investments in, or incentives to adopt, LED lighting or the elimination of, or changes in, policies, incentives or rebates in certain states or countries that encourage the use of LEDs over some traditional lighting technologies could cause the growth in demand for our products to slow, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues, profits and margins.\nWe believe the near-term growth of the LED market will be accelerated by government policies in certain countries that either directly promote the use of LEDs or discourage the use of some traditional lighting technologies. Today, the upfront cost of LED lighting exceeds the upfront cost for some traditional lighting technologies that provide similar lumen output in many applications. However, some governments around the world have used policy initiatives to accelerate the development and adoption of LED lighting and other non-traditional lighting technologies that are seen as more environmentally friendly compared to some traditional lighting technologies. Reductions in (including as a result of any budgetary constraints), or the elimination of, government investment and favorable energy policies could result in decreased demand for our products and decrease our revenues, profits and margins. Further, if our products fail to qualify for any financial incentives or rebates provided by governmental agencies or utilities for which our competitors\u2019 products qualify, such programs may diminish or eliminate our ability to compete by offering products at lower prices than our competitors.\nWe believe that certification and compliance issues are critical to the LED business.\nWe are required to comply with certain legal requirements governing the sale of LED products. Although we are not aware of any efforts to amend any existing legal requirements or implement new legal requirements in a manner with which we cannot comply, our revenue might be materially harmed if such an amendment or implementation were to occur.\nMoreover, although not legally required to do so, we strive to obtain certification for substantially all our products.\nGeneral Risks\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer.\nTo a significant extent our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team including our Executive Chairman, CEO, Chief Financial Officer and key technical personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. All of our employees, including our senior management, are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time Competition for highly skilled technical people is extremely intense, and we face challenges identifying, hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business. If we fail to retain our senior management and other key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our business could suffer.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of being a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time and financial resources to meet compliance obligations.\nAs a public company reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission, we incur significant legal, accounting, investor relations, board compensation and other expenses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including section 404(a) that requires that we annually evaluate and report on our systems of internal controls. In the future, there may be material weaknesses in our internal controls that would be required to be reported in our annual and quarterly reports. A negative reaction by the equity markets to the reporting of a material weakness could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may be subject to legal claims against us or claims by us which could have a significant impact on our resulting financial performance.\nAt any given time, we may be subject to litigation related to our products, suppliers, customers, employees, stockholders, distributors, sales representatives, sales of our assets, among other things, the disposition of which may have an adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, or results of operation. The outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify. Lawsuits can result in the payment of substantial damages by defendants. If we are required to pay substantial damages and expenses as a result of these or other types of lawsuits our business and results of operations would be adversely affected. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations. Insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends to our shareholders, which means that you could receive little or no return on your investment.\nPayment of dividends from our earnings and profits may be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors, subject to the provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes, our articles and restrictions imposed by our creditors. There is no assurance that we will generate any distributable cash from operations. Our board may elect to retain cash for operating purposes, debt retirement, plant improvements or expansion. Consequently, you may receive little or no return on your investment.\nWe may authorize and issue shares of new classes that could be superior to or adversely affect you as a holder of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors and shareholders have the power to authorize and issue shares of classes that have voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations and special rights, including preferred distribution rights, conversion rights, redemption rights and liquidation rights. These shares may be issued at a price and on terms determined by our board of directors. The terms of the shares and the terms of issuance of the shares could have an adverse impact on your rights and could dilute your financial interest in us.\nOur shares will be subordinate to all of our debts and liabilities, which increases the risk that you could lose your entire investment.\nOur shares are equity interests that will be subordinate to all of our current and future indebtedness with respect to claims on our assets. In any liquidation, all of our debts and liabilities must be paid before any payment is made to our shareholders. The amount of any debt financing we incur to finance the construction and commencement of operations at the plant, plus possible additional borrowings and operating liabilities, creates a substantial risk that in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, we may have no assets remaining for distribution to our shareholders after payment of our debts.\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market imposes listing standards on our common stock that we may not be able to fulfill, thereby leading to a possible delisting of our common stock.\nAs a listed Nasdaq Capital Market company, we are subject to rules covering, among other things, certain major corporate transactions, the composition of our Board of Directors and committees thereof, minimum bid price of our common stock and minimum stockholders\u2019 equity. The failure to meet the Nasdaq Capital Market requirements may result in the de-listing of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market price thereof.\nThe NASDAQ Capital Market may not continue to list our common stock for trading on its exchange if we do not comply with its continued listing requirements, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock and its liquidity.\nWe must comply with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements related to, among other things, stockholders\u2019 equity, market value, minimum bid price and corporate governance in order to remain listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Although we expect to meet the continued listing requirements, there can be no assurance we will continue to do so in the future. If we do not remain compliant with these continued listing requirements, we could be delisted. If we were delisted, it would be likely to have a negative impact on our stock price and liquidity. The delisting of our common stock could also deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise generating interest in or recommending our common stock, and would adversely affect our ability to attract investors in our common stock. Furthermore, our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. As a result of these factors, the value of the common stock could decline significantly.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is likely to be influenced by any research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. In the event securities or industry analysts cover us and one or more of these analysts downgrades our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. These risks could be especially significant for us since we have a small public float and limited analyst coverage.", "PERMNO": 14246, "SIC": 5063, "TIC": "FNRG"}
