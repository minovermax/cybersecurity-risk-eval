Risk Factors.\nYou should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nThe Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Have Had, and Are Expected to Continue to Have, a Significant Adverse Impact on Our Business, Liquidity, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental actions and restrictions, have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant adverse impact on the global economy, including the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas, and the level of demand for our services, which has impacted and is expected to continue to impact our business, liquidity, results of operations and our financial condition.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities have imposed mandatory closures, sought voluntary closures and imposed restrictions on, or advisories with respect to, travel, business operations and public gatherings or interactions. While many governmental authorities have loosened these restrictions, the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak may significantly worsen, and new strains of COVID-19 may emerge, which may cause governmental authorities to reconsider restrictions on travel, business and social activities. In the event governmental authorities retain, increase or reimpose restrictions, the loosening of restrictions may be further curtailed.\nIn early March 2020, OPEC+ was initially unable to reach an agreement to continue to impose limits on the production of crude oil, and shortly thereafter the World Health Organization determined the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. The convergence of these events created the unprecedented dual impact of a global oil demand decline coupled with the risk of a substantial increase in supply. In response to the rapid decline in commodity prices, exploration and production companies acted swiftly to reduce drilling and completion activity starting late in the first quarter of 2020. While oil prices and demand for our services have recovered in 2021, customer spending has not returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nGiven the nature and significance of the events described above, we are not able to enumerate all potential risks to our business from the recent volatility in crude oil prices and the COVID-19 pandemic; however, we believe that in addition to the impacts described above, other current and potential impacts of these recent events include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022liquidity challenges, including impacts related to delayed customer payments and payment defaults associated with customer liquidity issues and bankruptcies;\n\u2022customers, suppliers and other third parties seeking to terminate, reject, renegotiate or otherwise avoid, and otherwise failing to perform, their contractual obligations to us;\n\u2022additional credit rating downgrades of our corporate debt and potentially higher borrowing costs in the future;\n\u2022a need to preserve liquidity, which could result in a further reduction or suspension of our quarterly dividend or a delay or change in our capital investment plan;\n\u2022cybersecurity issues, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of cyberattacks in the current environment of remote connectivity;\n\u2022litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to COVID-19 and its impact, including with respect to commercial contracts, employee matters and insurance arrangements;\n\u2022disruption to our supply chain for raw materials essential to our business;\n\u2022loss of workers and labor shortages;\n\u2022general oilfield cost inflation, including increases in the cost of labor, services and supplies;\n\u2022a further reduction of our workforce to adjust to market conditions, including severance payments, retention issues, and an inability to hire employees when market conditions improve;\n\u2022additional costs associated with rationalization of our portfolio of real estate facilities, including exit of leases and facility closures to align with expected activity and workforce capacity;\n\u2022additional asset impairments, along with other accounting charges;\n\u2022additional infections and quarantining of our employees and the personnel of our customers, suppliers and other third parties in areas in which we operate and delays or suspensions of operations resulting therefrom;\n\u2022additional actions undertaken by international, national, regional and local governments and health officials, including mandates and testing, to contain the virus or treat its effects; and\n\u2022a structural shift in the global economy and its demand for oil and natural gas as a result of changes in the way people work, travel and interact, or in connection with a global recession or depression.\nThe full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will depend largely on future developments, including the duration and further spread of the virus, including any new strains of COVID-19, and the related impact on the oil and gas industry, the impact of governmental actions designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and the further development, availability, timely distribution and acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines, all of which are highly uncertain.\nWe Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas. Declines in Customers\u2019 Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. When these expenditures decline, our business may suffer. The rapid decline in oil prices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the activities of OPEC+ caused a significant decline in both customer activity and prices for our services in 2020. While oil prices and demand for our services have recovered in 2021, activity has not fully recovered to its 2019 levels, and these events therefore continue to have, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our business. Our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:\n\u2022the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including current natural gas storage capacity and usage,\n\u2022the prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas,\n\u2022the supply of and demand for drilling, pressure pumping and directional drilling services,\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas,\n\u2022the availability of capital for oil and natural gas industry participants, including our customers, and the extent to which they are willing or able to deploy capital,\n\u2022the availability of and constraints in pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity in the basins in which we operate,\n\u2022the environmental, tax and other laws and governmental regulations regarding the exploration, development, production, use and delivery of oil and natural gas, and in particular, public pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state, foreign, regional and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate drilling and pressure pumping activities, including hydraulic fracturing,\n\u2022 increased focus by the investment and financing community on sustainability practices in the oil and natural gas industry, and\n\u2022merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.\nIn particular, our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices. Oil and natural gas prices and markets can be extremely volatile. Prices, and expectations about future prices, are affected by factors such as:\n\u2022market supply and demand, including impacts on supply and demand due to economic repercussions from the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\u2022the desire and ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d), its members and other oil-producing nations, such as Russia, to set and maintain production and price targets,\n\u2022the level of production by OPEC and non-OPEC countries,\n\u2022domestic and international military, political, economic, health and weather conditions, including the impacts of war or terrorist activity, pandemics and other unexpected disasters or events such as the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\u2022changes to tax, tariff and import/export regulations by the United States or other countries,\n\u2022legal and other limitations or restrictions on exportation and/or importation of oil and natural gas,\n\u2022technical advances affecting energy consumption and production, and\n\u2022the development, price, availability and market acceptance of alternative fuels and energy sources.\nAll of these factors are beyond our control. Oil prices remain extremely volatile, as the closing price of oil (WTI-Cushing) reached a first quarter 2020 high of $63.27 per barrel on January 6, 2020, declined to negative $36.98 per barrel on April 20, 2020, and recovered to reach a 2021 high of $85.64 per barrel on October 26, 2021. In response to the rapid decline in commodity prices, E&P companies acted swiftly to reduce drilling and completion activity starting late in the first quarter of 2020. While oil prices have recovered in 2021, and demand for our services has improved since the commodity price decline in 2020, our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs, and a significant portion of our pressure pumping horsepower remains stacked. Oil prices averaged $77.45 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital. Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers\u2019 expectations of future oil and natural gas prices, as well as our customers\u2019 ability to access sources of capital to fund their operating and capital expenditures. A decline in demand for oil and natural gas, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices, expectations of decreases in oil and natural gas prices or a reduction in the ability of our customers to access capital would likely result in reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Even during periods of historically moderate or high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our services.\nGlobal Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nConcerns regarding global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, supply chain disruptions, inflation, the availability and cost of credit and the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to increased economic uncertainty. Demand for energy and for oil and natural gas end products is highly sensitive to economic conditions; as a result, global economic conditions, indications that economic growth is slowing and volatility in commodity prices may cause our customers to reduce or curtail their drilling and well completion programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our services. In addition, uncertainty in the capital markets, whether due to global economic conditions, including economic repercussions from the COVID-19 pandemic, low commodity prices or otherwise, may result in reduced access to, or an inability to obtain, financing by us, our customers and our suppliers and result in reduced demand for our services. An economic slowdown or recession in the United States or in any other country that significantly affects the supply of or demand for oil or natural gas could negatively impact our operations and therefore adversely affect our results. Furthermore, these factors may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability or unwillingness to pay suppliers, including us. The global economic environment in the past has experienced significant deterioration in a relatively short period, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is no assurance that the global economic environment, or expectations for the global economic environment, will not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors, including due to uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. A deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nA Surplus of Equipment and a Highly Competitive Oil Service Industry May Adversely Affect Our Utilization and Profit Margins and the Carrying Value of our Assets.\nThe land drilling and pressure pumping industries in the United States are highly competitive, and at times available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment. A low commodity price environment or capital spending reductions by our customers due to customer consolidation, investor requirements or other reasons can result in substantially more drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment being available than are needed to meet demand. In addition, in recent years there has been a substantial increase in new and upgraded drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment. Low commodity prices and new and upgraded equipment can result in excess capacity and substantial competition for a declining number of drilling and pressure pumping contracts. Even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and/or increased drilling and completion activity, reactivation and improvement of existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, construction of new technology drilling rigs and new pressure pumping equipment, and movement of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment from region to region in response to market conditions or otherwise can lead to a surplus of equipment.\nIn times of reduced demand for our industry\u2019s services, certain of our industry competitors may initiate bankruptcy proceedings or engage in debt refinancing transactions, management changes, or other strategic initiatives in an attempt to reduce operating costs to maintain a position in the market. This could result in such competitors emerging with stronger or healthier balance sheets and, in turn, an improved ability to compete with us in the future. We may also see corporate consolidations among both our customers and competitors, which could significantly alter industry conditions and competition within the industry, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe periodically seek to increase the prices on our services to offset rising costs, earn returns on our capital investment, and otherwise generate higher returns for our stockholders. However, we operate in a very competitive industry, and we are not always successful in raising or maintaining our existing prices. With drilling and completion activity well below the peak seen in 2014 and many rigs, including highly capable AC-powered rigs, and pressure pumping equipment still idle, there are limitations on the ability to raise or maintain prices across our fleet. Even if we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset rising costs without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain our pricing and to increase our pricing as costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, we may be unable to replace fixed-term contracts that expire or are terminated early, extend expiring contracts or obtain new contracts in the spot market, and the rates and other material terms under any new or extended contracts may be on substantially less favorable rates and terms.\nAccordingly, high competition and a surplus of equipment can cause oil and natural gas service contractors to have difficulty maintaining pricing, utilization and profit margins and, at times, result in operating losses. We cannot predict the future level of competition or surplus equipment in the oil and natural gas service businesses or the level of demand for our contract drilling, pressure pumping or directional drilling services.\nThe surplus of operable land drilling rigs, increasing rig specialization and surplus of pressure pumping and directional drilling equipment, which can be exacerbated by capital spending reductions by our customers, could affect the fair market value of our contract drilling, pressure pumping and directional drilling equipment, which in turn could result in additional impairments of our assets. A prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices or changes in customer preferences and requirements could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. For example, we recognized impairment charges of $267 million, $423 million and $221 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims. We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the businesses in which we operate, including inclement weather, blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, motor vehicle accidents, equipment failure, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage. These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages. These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages. An accident or other event resulting in significant environmental or property damage, or injuries or fatalities involving our employees or other persons could also trigger investigations by federal, state or local authorities. Such an accident or other event could cause us to incur substantial expenses in connection with the investigation, remediation and resolution, as well as cause lasting damage to our reputation, loss of customers and an inability to obtain insurance.\nWe have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance. In general, our contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage. Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers. In addition, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\nOur customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons. Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our equipment and certain other assets, employer\u2019s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers\u2019 compensation and insurance for other specific risks. We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available, or available on terms that are acceptable to us. While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, a substantial portion of our equipment and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of such equipment or other assets. We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies. For example, in the United States we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage, a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our equipment insurance coverage, a $10.0 million per occurrence deductible on our general liability coverage, a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our primary automobile liability insurance coverage, and a $5.0 million per occurrence deductible on our excess automobile liability insurance coverage. We also self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption and most of our cybersecurity risks, and we do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.\nOur insurance may not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations. Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions. As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage. There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive, or that our coverage will cover a specific loss. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable and recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.\nFixed-term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. However, in certain circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time, our bankruptcy, or a breach of our contract obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us. Additionally, during depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations or may seek to terminate or renegotiate or otherwise fail to honor their contractual obligations, including as a result of their bankruptcy. In addition, we may not be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control, and our customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons, including those described above. As a result, we may be unable to realize all of our current contract drilling backlog. In addition, the termination or renegotiation of fixed-term contracts without the receipt of early termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, our contract drilling backlog in the United States for future revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more, was approximately $325 million. Please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for a description of our calculation of backlog. Our contract drilling backlog may decline, as fixed-term drilling contract coverage over time may not be offset by new contracts or may be reduced by price adjustments to existing contracts, including as a result of the decline in the price of oil and natural gas, capital spending reductions by our customers or other factors. For these and other reasons, our contract drilling backlog may not generate sufficient liquidity for us during periods of reduced demand for our services.\nNew Technologies May Cause Our Operating Methods, Equipment and Services to Become Less Competitive, and Higher Levels of Capital Expenditures May Be Necessary to Remain Competitive.\nThe market for our services is characterized by continual technological and process developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance, including environmental performance, of drilling rigs and pressure pumping and other equipment. Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs and pressure pumping and other equipment, as well as new and improved technology, such as drilling automation technology and lower-emissions operations and services, and data analytics. Accordingly, we may have to allocate a higher proportion of our capital expenditures to maintain and improve existing rigs and pressure pumping and other equipment, purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs and pressure pumping and other equipment to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and develop new and improved technology and data analytics. In addition, technological changes, process improvements and other factors that increase operational efficiencies could continue to result in oil and natural gas wells being drilled and completed more quickly, which could reduce the number of revenue earning days. Technological and process developments in the pressure pumping and directional drilling businesses could have similar effects.\nIn recent years, we have added drilling rigs to our fleet through new construction and acquisitions, purchased new pressure pumping equipment and acquired a directional drilling services company. We have also improved existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment by adding equipment and technology designed to enhance functionality and performance and reduce emissions. Although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced oil and natural gas drilling, pressure pumping and directional drilling technology, changes in technology, improvements in competitors\u2019 equipment, increasing customer demands for new and improved technology, such as drilling automation technology and lower-emissions operations and services, and changes relating to the wells to be drilled and completed could make our equipment less competitive.\nWe continually attempt to develop new technologies for use in our business. In the event that we are successful in developing or acquiring new technologies for use in our business, there is no guarantee of future demand for those technologies. Customers may be reluctant or unwilling to adopt our new technologies. We may also have difficulty negotiating satisfactory terms for our new technologies, including terms that would enable us to obtain acceptable returns on our investment in the development or acquisition of new technologies.\nDevelopment and acquisition of new technology is critical to maintaining our competitiveness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop or acquire technology that our customers demand. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to enjoy technological advantages and develop, acquire and implement new technology on a more timely basis or in a more cost-effective manner. If we are not successful keeping pace with technological advances in a timely and cost-effective manner, demand for our services may decline. If any technology that we need to successfully compete is not available to us or that we implement in the future does not work as we expect, we may be adversely affected. Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our equipment and services obsolete, which could reduce our competitiveness and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operation.\nLoss of Key Personnel and Competition for Experienced Personnel May Negatively Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe greatly depend on the efforts of our key employees to manage our operations. The loss of members of management could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we utilize highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting our businesses and in developing new technologies. In times of increasing demand for our services, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly after a prolonged industry downturn. During periods of high demand for our services or inflation, wage rates for operations personnel are also likely to increase, resulting in higher operating costs. During periods of lower demand for our services, we may experience reductions in force and voluntary departures of key personnel, which could adversely affect our business and make it more it difficult to meet customer demands when demand for our services improves. In addition, even in a period of generally lower demand for our services, if there is a high demand for our services in certain areas, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel to perform services in such areas. We may also face a loss of workers and labor shortages as a result of quarantines, vaccine mandates or requirements and enforcement of other COVID-19 regulations in jurisdictions where we operate. The loss of key employees, the failure to attract and retain qualified personnel and the increase in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Loss of Large Customers Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWith respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2021, we received approximately 57% from our ten largest customers and approximately 39% from our five largest customers and 16% from our largest customer. The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nShortages, Delays in Delivery, and Interruptions in Supply, of Equipment and Materials Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nPeriodically, the oilfield services industry has experienced shortages of equipment for upgrades, drill pipe, replacement parts and other equipment and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, proppants, acid, gel and water. These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use. In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations. Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons:\n\u2022effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\u2022weather issues, whether short-term such as a hurricane, or long-term such as a drought,\n\u2022transportation and other logistical challenges, and\n\u2022a shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties or bankruptcies or consolidation.\nThese price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to delay operations, increase capital and repair expenditures or otherwise incur higher operating costs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been significant disruptions and delays across the global supply chain, which have created a tightening of supplies and shortages in a number of areas, including basic raw materials. Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could increase our costs and limit our ability to operate, maintain, upgrade and construct our drilling rigs and pressure pumping and other equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur Business Is Subject to Cybersecurity Risks and Threats.\nOur operations are increasingly dependent on effective and secure information technologies and services. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems, theft, viruses, malware, design defects, human error, or complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:\n\u2022theft or misappropriation of funds, including via \u201cphishing\u201d or similar attacks directed at us or our customers;\n\u2022loss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary or confidential information (including customer, supplier, or employee data);\n\u2022disruption or impairment of our and our customers\u2019 business operations and safety procedures;\n\u2022personal injuries and destruction or damage to our and our customers\u2019 property;\n\u2022downtime and loss of revenue;\n\u2022injury to our reputation, including the perception of our products or services as having security vulnerabilities;\n\u2022negative impacts on our ability to compete;\n\u2022loss or damage to our information technology systems, including operational technologies and worksite data delivery systems;\n\u2022exposure to litigation and legal and regulatory costs; and\n\u2022increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our office personnel have moved to a \u201cremote work\u201d model. This model has significantly increased the use of remote networking and online conferencing services that enable employees to work outside of our corporate infrastructure and, in some cases, use their own personal devices. This may expose us to additional cybersecurity risks or related incidents.\nAlthough we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to the risks described above, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. There can be no assurance that the procedures and controls that we implement, or that we cause third party service providers to implement, will be sufficient to protect our people, systems, information or other property. Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period of time. We self-insure most of our cybersecurity risks, and any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to incur additional costs to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate the effects of cyber incidents.\nOur Commitments Under Supply Agreements Could Exceed Our Requirements, Exposing Us to Risks Including Price, Timing of Delivery and Quality of Equipment and Materials Upon Which Our Business Relies.\nWe have purchase commitments with certain vendors to supply equipment and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping business, proppants. Some of these agreements are take-or-pay agreements with minimum purchase obligations. If demand for our services decreases from current levels, demand for the equipment that we use and the materials that we supply as part of these services will also decrease. In addition, our customers may self-source certain materials. If demand for our services and/or materials decreases enough, we could have contractual minimum commitments that exceed the required amount of materials we need to supply to our customers. In this instance, we could be required to purchase materials that we do not have a present need for, pay for materials that we do not take delivery of or pay prices in excess of market prices at the time of purchase.\nGrowth Through Acquisitions, the Building or Upgrading of Equipment and the Development of Technology Is Not Assured.\nWe have grown our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping fleet and expanded our business lines and use of technology in the past through mergers, acquisitions, upgrades, new construction and technology development. For example, we completed the Pioneer acquisition during 2021. There can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future or that we will be able to execute timely or efficiently any plans for building or upgrading equipment or developing new technology. We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities. In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, our competitors may continue to upgrade and build new equipment and develop new technology, including drilling automation technology and lower-emissions operations and services.\nThere can be no assurance that we will:\n\u2022have sufficient capital resources to complete additional acquisitions, build or upgrade equipment or develop new technology,\n\u2022successfully integrate additional equipment, acquired or developed technology or other assets or businesses, including Pioneer,\n\u2022effectively manage the growth and increased size, complexity and geography of our organization, including as a result of the Pioneer acquisition,\n\u2022successfully deploy idle, stacked, upgraded or additional equipment and acquired or developed technology,\n\u2022maintain the crews necessary to operate additional equipment or the personnel necessary to evaluate, acquire, develop and deploy new technology, or\n\u2022successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition, the building or upgrading equipment or the development of new technology.\nOur failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate acquired businesses and technology and other assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may incur liabilities arising from events prior to any acquisitions, prior to our establishment of adequate compliance oversight or in connection with disputes over acquired or developed technology. While we generally seek to obtain indemnities for liabilities arising from events occurring before such acquisitions, these are limited in amount and duration, may be held to be unenforceable or the seller may not be able to indemnify us.\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build or upgrade equipment or acquire or develop new technology, and we also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building or upgrade program. Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.\nFuel Conservation Measures Could Reduce Demand for Oil and Natural Gas, Which Would, In Turn, Reduce the Demand for Our Services.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar geothermal, tidal, and biofuels) or increased focus on reducing the use of oil and natural gas (such as governmental mandates that ban the sale of new gasoline-powered automobiles) could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and therefore for our services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nPotential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing or Other Aspects of the Oil and Gas Industry Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.\nNumerous political and regulatory authorities, governmental bodies and officials, and environmental groups devote resources to campaigns aimed at eradicating hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production.\nPresident Biden and other political candidates and officeholders stated that they would support either increased regulation or a ban on hydraulic fracturing; however, we cannot predict whether hydraulic fracturing regulations will be enacted during the Biden Administration or how stringent they may be. In addition, members of the U.S. Congress and the EPA have reviewed proposals for more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, and various state and local initiatives have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against other industry participants alleging damages and regulatory violations in connection with such activity. These and other ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of the oil and gas industry.\nIn addition, legislation has been proposed, but not enacted, and may be proposed in the future, in the U.S. Congress to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process are impairing ground water or causing other damage. These bills, if enacted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could limit or delay operational activities or increase operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform or limit hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nRegulatory efforts at the federal level and in many states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. Certain states where we operate have adopted or are considering disclosure legislation and/or regulations, including a variety of well construction, set back and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure.\nSome parties believe that there is a correlation between hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such seismic activity is called induced seismicity. The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies of both state and federal agencies. In light of concerns about induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity.\nFinally, several jurisdictions have taken steps to enact hydraulic fracturing bans, moratoria or increased regulations on hydraulic fracturing practices. These actions have been the subject of legal challenges.\nThe full impact of the foregoing actions remains unclear, but the adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could restrict our ability, or make it more difficult, to perform hydraulic fracturing and could increase our costs of compliance and doing business and reduce demand for our services. Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, the adoption of significant restrictions or a prohibition on hydraulic fracturing by a state, region or locality could result in a surplus of oilfield equipment in other states, regions or localities where hydraulic fracturing remains allowed.\nOur and Our Customers\u2019 Operations are Subject to a Number of Risks Arising Out of the Threat of Climate Change That Could Result in Increased Operating and Capital Costs, Limit the Areas in Which Oil and Natural Gas Production May Occur and Reduce Demand for Our Services.\nThe physical and regulatory effects of climate change could have a negative impact on our operations, our customers\u2019 operations and the overall demand for our customers\u2019 products and, accordingly, our services. There is an increasing focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. Some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislation, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain oil and natural gas system sources, implement CAA emission standards directing the reduction of methane emissions from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the DOT, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States.\nIn April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. Under the Paris Agreement, the Biden Administration has committed the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels by 2030. In November 2021, the Unites States and other countries entered into the Glasgow Climate Pact, which includes a range of measures designed to address climate change, including but not limited to the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, reducing methane emissions 30% by 2030, and cooperating toward the advancement of the development of clean energy. Several states and geographic regions in the United States have also adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs, including cap and trade regimes and commitments to contribute to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States. President Biden and the Democratic Party, which currently controls Congress, have identified climate change as a priority, and it is likely that additional executive orders, regulatory action, and/or legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions, or prohibiting or restricting oil and gas development activities in certain areas, will be proposed and/or promulgated during the Biden Administration. President Biden issued an executive order imposing a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. President Biden\u2019s order also established climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security consideration, affirms that achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or before midcentury is a critical priority, affirms the Biden Administration\u2019s desire to establish the United States as a leader in addressing climate change, generally further integrates climate change and environmental justice considerations into government agencies\u2019 decision-making, and eliminates fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures. Other actions impacting oil and natural gas production activities that could be pursued by the Biden administration may include more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of liquified natural gas export facilities.\nIt is not possible at this time to predict the timing and effects of climate change or whether additional climate-related legislation, regulations or other measures will be adopted at the local, state, regional, national and international levels. However, continued efforts by governments and non-governmental organizations to reduce GHG emissions appear likely, and additional legislation, regulation or other measures that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our business. The cost of complying with any new law, regulation or treaty will depend on the details of the particular program. We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations increase compliance costs, add operating restrictions, or reduce demand for our customers\u2019 products and, accordingly, our services.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for oil and natural gas producers, as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in oil and natural gas companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change, ESG and other sustainability-related issues may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors, or into competitors who are perceived to have stronger ESG practices and disclosures. Our ESG practices and disclosures may not satisfy investor requirements or their requirements may not be made known to us. We may continue to face increasing pressure regarding our ESG practices and disclosures, which pressures have intensified recently in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, significant societal events and worldwide efforts to mitigate climate change. Additionally, the lending and investment practices of institutional lenders and investors have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, not to provide funding for oil and natural gas producers. Limitation of investments in and financings for oil and natural gas could result in the restriction, delay, or cancellation of drilling and completion programs or development of production activities. An increasing number of our customers consider sustainability factors in awarding work. If we are unable to meet the ESG standards or investment criteria set by our customers, investors and other parties, or if we are unable to successfully continue our sustainability enhancement efforts, we may lose customers, we may lose investors, our cost of capital may increase, our stock price may be negatively impacted, our reputation may be negatively affected, and it may be more difficult for us to effectively compete.\nIncreasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of lawsuits or investigations brought by public and private entities against oil and natural gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions. Should we be targeted by any such litigation or investigations, we may incur liability, which, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, could be imposed without regard to the causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.\nThese political, litigation, and financial risks may result in our customers restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damage as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for our products and services. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nEnvironmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial. A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to:\n\u2022substantial civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties or judgments,\n\u2022modification, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations,\n\u2022imposition of limitations on our operations, and\n\u2022performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.\nIn addition, environmental laws and regulations in the places that we operate impose a variety of requirements on \u201cresponsible parties\u201d related to the prevention of spills and liability for damages from such spills. As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, a manufacturer and servicer of equipment and automation to the energy, marine and mining industries and a provider of directional drilling and other services, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.\nTechnology Disputes Could Negatively Impact Our Operations or Increase Our Costs.\nOur services and products use proprietary technology and equipment, which can involve potential infringement of a third party\u2019s rights, or a third party\u2019s infringement of our rights, including patent rights. The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to our drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and directional drilling services are owned by us or certain of our supplying vendors. However, in the event that we or one of our customers or supplying vendors becomes involved in a dispute over infringement of intellectual property rights relating to equipment or technology owned or used by us, services performed by us or products provided by us, we may lose access to important equipment or technology or our ability to provide services or products, or we could be required to cease use of some equipment or technology or forced to modify our equipment, technology, services or products. We could also be required to pay license fees or royalties for the use of equipment or technology or provision of services or products. In addition, we may lose a competitive advantage in the event we are unsuccessful in enforcing our rights against third parties. Regardless of the merits, any such claims may result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business. Technology disputes involving us or our customers or supplying vendors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Design, Manufacture, Sale and Servicing of Products, including Electrical Controls, May Subject Us to Liability for Personal Injury, Property Damage and Environmental Contamination Should Such Equipment Fail to Perform to Specifications.\nWe provide products, including electrical controls, to customers involved in oil and gas exploration, development and production and in the marine and mining industries. Because of applications that use our products and services, a failure of such equipment, or a failure of our customer to maintain or operate the equipment properly, could cause harm to our reputation, contractual and warranty-related liability, damage to the equipment, damage to the property of customers and others, personal injury and environmental contamination, leading to claims against us.\nLegal Proceedings and Governmental Investigations Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time. In addition, during periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers, vendors, current and former employees and others initiating legal proceedings against us. Additionally, actions or decisions we have taken or may take as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in investigations, litigation or legal claims against us. Lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any legal proceedings or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. Please see \u201cOur Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims. We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.\u201d\nPolitical, Economic and Social Instability Risk and Laws Associated with Conducting International Operations Could Adversely Affect Our Opportunities and Future Business.\nWe provide contract drilling services in Colombia, we sell products, including electrical controls, for use in numerous oil and gas producing regions outside of North America, and through our Superior QC business, we occasionally provide remote data analytics and other services to customers to support their operations outside of the United States. We also continue to evaluate opportunities from time to time to provide our other services outside of the United States. International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties generally not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of social and political unrest, changing political conditions and changing laws and policies affecting trade and investment, strikes, work stoppages, labor disputes and other slowdowns, terrorism, war, kidnapping of employees, regional economic downturns, nationalization, forced negotiation or modification of contracts, difficulty resolving disputes and enforcing contractual rights, difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable, potentially longer payment cycles, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of oil and gas exploration and drilling rights, foreign taxation and customs regulations, the overlap of different tax structures, changes in taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions and restrictions on repatriation of income and capital, currency rate fluctuations, increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy and industry in the markets in which we may operate, economic and financial instability of national oil companies, and restrictive governmental regulation, bureaucratic delays and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted.\nThere can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements, or the interpretation thereof, which could have a material adverse effect on the cost of entry into international markets, the profitability of international operations or the ability to continue those operations in certain areas. Because of the impact of local laws, any future international operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable. Additionally, we may be subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nThere can be no assurance that we will:\n\u2022identify attractive opportunities in international markets,\n\u2022have sufficient capital resources to pursue and consummate international opportunities,\n\u2022successfully integrate international drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets or businesses, such as the Colombia contract drilling business acquired through the Pioneer acquisition,\n\u2022effectively manage the start-up, development and growth of an international organization and assets,\n\u2022hire, attract and retain the personnel necessary to successfully conduct international operations, or\n\u2022receive awards for work and successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of the entry into one or more international markets.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Some parts of the world where our services could be provided or where our consumers for products are located have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practice and could impact business. Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject to us to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, investors could negatively view potential violations, inquiries or allegations of misconduct under the FCPA or similar laws, which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our shares. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets.\nMany countries, including the United States, control the import and export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related import and export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities. In particular, U.S. sanctions are targeted against certain countries that are heavily involved in the oil and gas industry. The laws and regulations concerning import and export activity, recordkeeping and reporting, including customs, export controls and economic sanctions, are complex and constantly changing. Any failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements governing international trade could also result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from government contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges.\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness to finance an international transaction or operations, and we also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such transactions or operations. Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, international expansion could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.\nThe occurrence of one or more events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nWe Are Dependent Upon Our Subsidiaries to Meet our Obligations Under Our Long-Term Debt.\nWe have borrowings outstanding under our senior notes and, from time to time, our revolving credit facility. Our ability to meet our interest and principal payment obligations depends in large part on cash flows from our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flows, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations.\nVariable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly.\nWe have in place a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility. Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit facility at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate. The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 1.00% to 2.00% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 0.00% to 1.00%, in each case determined based upon our credit rating. As of December 31, 2021, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 1.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 0.75%. As of December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nWe also have in place a reimbursement agreement pursuant to which we are required to reimburse the issuing bank on demand for any amounts that it has disbursed under any of our letters of credit issued thereunder. We are obligated to pay the issuing bank interest on all amounts not paid by us on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum. As of December 31, 2021, no amounts had been disbursed under any letters of credit.\nInterest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase our total interest expense, depending upon the amounts borrowed at floating rates under these agreements or under future agreements.\nA Downgrade in Our Credit Rating Could Negatively Impact Our Cost of and Ability to Access Capital.\nOur ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by major U.S. credit rating agencies. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, commodity pricing levels, industry conditions and other considerations, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability in the future to access debt markets, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations.\nWe May Not Be Able to Generate Sufficient Cash to Service All of Our Debt and We May Be Forced to Take Other Actions to Satisfy Our Obligations Under Our Debt, which May Not Be Successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIn addition, if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements. In the absence of such cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. However, our debt agreements contain restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and any proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Corporate Structure\nThe Market Price of Our Common Stock May Be Highly Volatile, and Investors May Not Be Able to Resell Shares at or Above the Price Paid.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as other general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating and/or financial performance. The following factors, in addition to other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Report, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022investor perception of us and the industry and markets in which we operate;\n\u2022general financial, domestic, international, economic, and market conditions, including overall fluctuations in the U.S. equity markets;\n\u2022increased focus by the investment community on sustainability practices at our company and in the oil and natural gas industry generally;\n\u2022changes in customer needs, expectations or trends and our ability to maintain relationships with key customers;\n\u2022our ability to implement our business strategy;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, including the issuance of additional debt;\n\u2022public announcements (including the timing of these announcements) regarding our business, financial performance and prospects or new services or products, service or product enhancements, technological advances or strategic actions, such as acquisitions or divestitures, restructurings or significant contracts, by our competitors or us;\n\u2022trading activity in our stock, including portfolio transactions in our stock by us, our executive officers and directors, and significant stockholders or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which we may be included;\n\u2022short-interest in our common stock, which could be significant from time to time;\n\u2022our inclusion in, or removal from, any stock indices;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022whether or not we meet earnings estimates of securities analysts who follow us; and\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the United States and foreign countries where we operate.\nAnti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price.\nWe are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law. Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock. It also prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent without the holding of a meeting. In addition, our bylaws impose certain advance notification requirements as to business that can be brought by a stockholder before annual stockholder meetings and as to persons nominated as directors by a stockholder. As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us. This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions.", "PERMNO": 79857, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "PTEN"}
