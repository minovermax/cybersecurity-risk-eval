{"cik": "1526520", "company": "TripAdvisor, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report as they may impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, results of operations or financial condition. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to continue to increase visitors to our websites and to cost-effectively convert these visitors into repeat users or contributors, our advertising revenue could decline.\nThe primary asset that we use to attract visitors to our websites and convert these visitors into repeat users is our ability to collect, create, organize and distribute high-quality, commercially valuable content that meets users\u2019 specific interests and enables them to use the content and interact with the supporting communities. There can be no assurances that we will continue to obtain content in a cost-effective manner or in a manner that meets rapidly changing consumer demand. Any failure to obtain and manage such content in a manner that will engage users, or a failure to provide content and products that are perceived as useful, reliable and trustworthy, could adversely affect user experiences and reduce traffic to our websites, which would make our websites less attractive to advertisers. Any change in the cost structure pursuant to which we obtain our content, in travelers\u2019 relative appreciation of user-based versus expert content, in the quality of our content versus other sites\u2019 content or any other changes that could reduce traffic to our websites would negatively impact our business and financial performance.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from advertising and any significant reduction in spending by advertisers could harm our business.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of advertising, primarily through click-based advertising and, to a lesser extent, display-based advertising. We enter into master advertising contracts with our advertising partners, however, these agreements are generally limited to matters such as privacy and compliance, payment terms and conditions, termination and indemnities and most can be terminated by our partners at will or on short notice. Our ability to grow advertising revenue with our existing or new advertising partners is dependent in large part on our ability to generate revenue for them. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in such advertising does not generate sales leads, customers, bookings, or revenue and profit on a cost-effective basis. If we are unable to provide value to our advertising partners, they will likely stop placing ads on our websites, which would harm our revenues and business. We cannot guarantee that our current advertisers will fulfill their obligations under existing contracts, continue to advertise beyond the terms of existing contracts or enter into any additional contracts with us.\nClick-based advertising accounts for the majority of our advertising revenue. Any changes we make to our business model may impact our advertising revenue in ways that we do not expect. In addition, if new, more effective advertising models were to emerge, there can be no assurance that we will have the ability to offer these models, or offer them in an effective manner.\nFurthermore, our CPC pricing for click-based advertising depends, in part, on competition between advertisers. If our large advertisers become less competitive with each other, merge with each other or with our competitors, focus more on per-click profit than on traffic volume, or are able to reduce CPCs, this could have an adverse impact on our click-based advertising revenue which would, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExpenditures by advertisers also tend to be cyclical, subject to variation based on budgetary constraints, project cancellation or delay, and to reflect overall economic conditions and buying patterns. If we are unable to generate advertising revenue due to factors outside of our control, our business and financial performance would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a relatively small number of significant advertising partners and any reduction in spending by or loss of these partners advertisers could seriously harm our business.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of advertising partners and rely significantly on our relationships. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2015, our two most significant advertising partners, Expedia and\nPriceline (and their subsidiaries), accounted for a combined 46% of total revenue. While we enter into master advertising contracts with our partners, the terms of these agreements generally address matters such as privacy and compliance, payment terms and conditions, termination and indemnities and most of these contracts can be terminated by our partners at will or on short notice. If any of our significant advertisers were to cease or significantly curtail advertising on our websites, we could experience a rapid decline in our revenue over a relatively short period of time which would have a material impact on our business.\nOur businesses could be negatively affected by changes in Internet search engine algorithms and dynamics, or search engine disintermediation.\nWe rely heavily on Internet search engines, such as Google, to generate traffic to our websites, principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords. Search engines, including Google, frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user\u2019s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected. In addition, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing our websites to place lower in search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking of our websites or those of our partners, or if competitive dynamics impact the cost or effectiveness of SEO or SEM in a negative manner, our business and financial performance would be adversely affected, potentially to a material extent. Furthermore, our failure to successfully manage our SEO and SEM strategies could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic.\nIn addition, to the extent that Google or other leading search or metasearch engines that have a significant presence in our key markets, disintermediate OTA\u2019s or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning or shopping capabilities, or refer those leads to suppliers directly, or to other favored partners, there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance. To the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic, whether on desktop, tablet or mobile devices, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe continue to work aggressively on rolling out our \u201cinstant booking\u201d feature despite anticipated and potential unanticipated challenges and risks which could have a negative impact on our business and financial performance.\nInstant booking is a feature that enables users to book a hotel reservation directly with a hotel or online travel agency partner while remaining on the TripAdvisor website. We have been gradually rolling this feature out in the U.S. since June 2014, and, in 2015, accelerated the rollout of instant booking for hotels across our U.S. and U.K. platforms to all users on all devices. We plan to continue rolling out this feature to additional international markets in 2016. We believe that allowing users to book directly online without leaving the TripAdvisor site will result in a better user experience as well as, ultimately, additional revenue to the Company. However, there are additional risks associated with this feature.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with partners in the travel industry, including hotel chains, online travel agencies and travel suppliers and other online travel partners. We are working with some of these partners to \u201cpower\u201d the instant booking function on our website and believe that these partners will also benefit from this feature, through increased reservations and more direct relationships with travelers. Some partners, however, may view this new functionality as directly competitive and take action that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. They could reduce or eliminate advertising revenue paid to us, charge for or otherwise restrict access to content, further reduce their average daily rates, decide not to make their travel inventory available to us, or decide not to provide accurate booking information. Any of these actions could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe roll out of our new \u201cinstant booking\u201d feature may not meet our expectations and may subject us to additional and ongoing operational risks.\nCurrently our instant booking feature is monetizing at a lower revenue per hotel shopper rate compared to our metasearch feature. While we expect to close this monetization gap, primarily by continuing to streamline our booking path to enhance user experience, persistently promoting the TripAdvisor brand as a booking channel and continuing to seek partners with strong branding and supply channels, there is no guarantee that these initiatives will ultimately be successful and, if not, our revenue may be materially adversely affected.\nOur instant booking revenue recorded under the consumption model is recognized at the time the traveler completes his or her stay. Comparatively, revenue under the transaction model is recorded at the time the user books the stay and revenue from our metasearch feature is recorded when a traveler makes the click-through to the travel partners\u2019 websites. Based on our internal data, we currently estimate the average time between a user booking a stay to consuming a stay is approximately three to five weeks, subject to seasonal variations. In future periods, greater contribution of revenue from our instant booking consumption model would result in additional revenue recognized at the time of a consumed stay and thus a shift in the timing of our revenue recognition.\nWe expect the instant booking functionality to significantly increase the number of transactions that will occur on our website. Even though the transaction and customer care associated with these transactions are provided by our hotel partners, each reservation is completed on TripAdvisor\u2019s instant booking platform. Failure to effectively manage the process for instantly booking on our website and the safeguard data that is obtained during the course of arranging for such bookings could negatively impact our reputation and, consequently, our business.\nGrowth in the use of devices other than desktop computers may negatively affect our revenue and financial results.\nOur content was originally designed for users accessing the Internet on a desktop computer. The number of people who access the Internet through devices other than desktops computers, including mobile phone devices and handheld computers such as notebooks and tablets, has increased substantially in the last few years. We anticipate that the rate of use of these computing devices will continue to grow. To address these growing user demands, we continue to extend our platform to develop mobile phone and tablet applications and our advertising revenues continue to grow. However, currently, we monetize users of these devices at a lower rate compared to users who access our websites through desktop computers. In addition, given the device sizes and technical limitations of these devices, mobile consumers may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple companies providing similar service and instead prefer to use one or a limited number of apps for their hotel, restaurant and attractions activity. The consumer experience with mobile apps as well as brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important.\nAs a result, we continue to develop and improve upon our mobile app and websites and mobile monetization strategies. If we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new, user-friendly and differentiated mobile offerings and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms, or if our mobile offerings are not used by consumers, our future growth and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nDeclines or disruptions in the economy in general and travel industry in particular could adversely affect our businesses and financial performance.\nOur businesses and financial performance are affected by the health of the global economy generally as well as the travel industry and leisure travel in particular. Sales of travel services tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns and recessions when consumers engage in less discretionary spending, are concerned about unemployment or inflation, have reduced access to credit or experience other concerns that reduce their ability or willingness to travel. The global economy may be adversely impacted by unforeseen events beyond our control including acts of terrorism, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters, political instability and health concerns (including epidemics or pandemics such as Zika virus, Ebola, H1N1 and SARS), defaults on government debt, significant increases in fuel and energy costs, tax increases and other matters that could reduce discretionary spending, tightening of credit markets and further declines in consumer confidence. Decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for our services, thereby causing a reduction in revenue.\nIn addition, the uncertainty of macro-economic factors and their impact on consumer behavior, which may differ across regions, makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on our markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on the value of our brand and consumer trust in our brand. If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, or if events occur that damage our reputation and brand, our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that the TripAdvisor brand has contributed significantly to our success and that maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our base of users, to creating content and to attracting advertisers. As a result, we invest significantly in brand marketing. We expect these investments to continue, or even increase, as a result of a variety of factors, including increased spending from competitors, the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands, expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known, inflation in media pricing, and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines as destination sites for travelers. Such efforts may not maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and, even if we are successful in our branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective or as efficient as they have been historically. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands or to generate demand in a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe receive significant media coverage in our various geographic markets. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our practices relating to privacy and data protection, product changes, competitive pressures, the accuracy of user-generated content, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, could adversely affect our reputation with our users and our advertisers. Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe operate in an increasingly competitive global environment and our failure to compete effectively could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\nWe face competition for content, users, advertisers, online travel search and price comparison services (or hotel metasearch) and online reservations. We also face competition from large companies that also offer comprehensive on-line resources for destinations, lodging, attractions and restaurants. Many of our competitors have significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do and may be able to leverage other aspects of their business to enable them to compete more effectively against us.\nMore specifically:\n\u00b7\nFor content, we face competition from large online portals, social networking sites and search engines, such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Baidu, which competition will only increase should they choose to compete more directly with us in the travel review space, and create commercially valuable online content at significant scale. For example, Google + Local, with its aggregated reviews and local recommendations, competes with us and Google\u2019s access to more comprehensive data regarding user search queries through its search algorithms gives it a significant competitive advantage over other companies in the industry, including us. In addition, if significant numbers of users adopt Facebook\u2019s newly released Graph Search to get travel recommendations, it could have the effect of reducing traffic and user engagement on TripAdvisor.\n\u00b7\nWe face competition from online travel agents, such as Expedia and Priceline (and their subsidiaries), and this competition may increase to the extent that these online travel agents accumulate and develop a comprehensive offering of travel-related reviews and resources.\n\u00b7\nWe face competition from travel service providers such as major hotel companies, airlines and rental car companies, many of which have their own websites to which they drive business. Major hotel companies may also attempt to improve their competitive position by offering lower room rates, better room availability or additional features or amenities through their reservation service than are available through services like ours.\n\u00b7\nWe also face competition from wholesalers, tour operators, traditional offline travel agencies and operators of travel industry reservation databases such as Galileo, Travelport, Amadeus and Sabre.\n\u00b7\nIn addition, we compete with newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide offline and online advertising opportunities.\n\u00b7\nIn our vacation rental business, we face competition from several companies, including HomeAway (a subsidiary of Expedia) and Airbnb, Inc., some of whom have a larger inventory of rooms available.\n\u00b7\nIn our restaurant reservation and attractions business, we face competition from certain companies like OpenTable (a subsidiary of Priceline), SeatMe (which is owned by Yelp) and Table8 (which was recently launched by Amazon) as well as other regional players operating in various parts of the world.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources compared to us and have expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating Internet traffic as well as large client bases. We expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the travel advertising market.\nCertain of the companies we do business with, including some of our click-based advertising partners, are also our competitors. The consolidation of our competitors and partners, including Expedia (through its acquisitions of Trivago, Orbitz, Travelocity, and HomeAway) and Priceline (through its acquisitions of Kayak and OpenTable), may affect our relative competitiveness and our partner relationships. Competition and consolidation could result in higher traffic acquisition costs, reduced margins on our advertising services, loss of market share, reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites. For example, Google has taken steps to appeal more directly to travel customers, which could lead to diversion of customer traffic to their own websites or those of a favored partner, or undermine our ability to obtain prominent placement in paid or unpaid search results at a reasonable cost, or at all. Competition in our industry may result in pricing pressure, loss of market share or decreased member engagement, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving competition, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, free speech issues, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. In addition, our businesses face intellectual property litigation that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell products and services.\nSuch claims, suits, and government investigations are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, injunctions or damage awards and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in our business practices or other field action, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon the quality of traffic in our network to provide value to online advertisers, and any failure in our quality control could have a material adverse effect on the value of our websites to our advertisers and adversely affect our revenue.\nWe use technology and processes to monitor the quality of and to identify metrics associated with, the Internet traffic that we deliver to online advertisers. These metrics are used to not only identify the value of advertising on our website but also to identify low quality clicks such as non-human processes, including robots, spiders or other software; the mechanical automation of clicking; and other types of invalid clicks or click fraud. Even with such monitoring in place, there is a risk that a certain amount of low-quality traffic, or traffic that online advertisers deem to be invalid, will be delivered to such online advertisers. As a result, we may be required to credit amounts owed to us by our advertisers. Furthermore, low-quality or invalid traffic may be detrimental to our relationships with advertisers, and could adversely affect our advertising pricing and revenue.\nWe rely on assumptions and estimates and data to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe believe that certain metrics are key to our business, including unique visitors, hotel shoppers, revenue per hotel shopper, downloads of our mobile apps, and number of reviews and opinions. As the industry in which we operate continues to evolve and as our business continues to evolve, so too might the metrics by which we evaluate our business. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates, our internal tools have a number of limitations and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time. For example, a single person may have multiple accounts or browse the internet on multiple browsers or devices, some users may restrict our ability to accurately identify them across visits, some mobile applications automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action, and we are not always able to capture user information on all of our platforms. As such, the calculations of our unique visitors may not accurately reflect the number of people actually visiting our platforms. Also if the internal tools we use to track these metrics under-count or over-count performance or contain algorithm or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. In addition, historically, certain metrics were calculated by independent third parties. Accordingly readers should not place undue reliance on these numbers.\nMore recently, we started to calculate metrics, primarily using internal tools, which are not independently verified by a third party. We continue to improve upon our tools and methodologies to capture data and believe that our current metrics are more accurate; however, the improvement of our tools and methodologies could cause inconsistency between current data and previously reported data, which could confuse investors or lead to questions about the integrity of our data.\nWe rely on information technology to operate our business and remain competitive, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our businesses.\nWe depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems. As our operations grow in size and scope, we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. Our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance, features and reliability of our services in response to competitive service and product offerings. The emergence of alternative platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology. New developments in other areas, such as cloud computing, could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower up-front technology costs. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a cost-effective manner.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and provide tools and services that are useful to travelers, we may not remain competitive, and our business and financial performance could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on continued innovation to provide features and services that make our websites and smartphone and tablet computing applications useful for travelers. Our competitors are continually developing innovations in online travel-related services and features. As a result, we are continually working to improve our business model and user experience in order to drive user\ntraffic and conversion dates. We can give no assurances that the changes we make will yield the benefits we expect and will not have adverse impacts that we did not anticipate. If we are unable to continue offering innovative products and services and quality features that travelers want to use, existing users may become dissatisfied and use competitors\u2019 offerings and we may be unable to attract additional users, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nOur culture emphasizes rapid innovation and prioritizes user engagement over short-term financial results.\nWe operate in a culture that encourages rapid development and release of new and improved products, which may at times result in unintended consequences or decisions that are poorly received by users or advertisers. Our culture also prioritizes user engagement, or website \u201cstickiness,\u201d over short-term financial results. We have taken actions in the past and may continue to make product decisions going forward that have the effect of reducing our short-term revenue or profitability if we believe that the decisions benefit the aggregate user experience, conversion rates and/or CPC pricing, thereby ultimately improving our financial performance over the long-term. The short-term reductions in revenue or profitability could be more severe than we anticipate or these decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our user growth and engagement, our relationships with users and advertisers, and our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe online vacation rental market is rapidly evolving and if we fail to predict the manner in which the market develops, our business and prospects may suffer.\nWe offer vacation rental services on our TripAdvisor-branded sites as well as through our U.S.-based FlipKey and Vacation Home Rentals and European-based Holiday Lettings and Niumba businesses. The online vacation rental market is rapidly evolving in many respects, including acceptance of the business model by travelers, property owners and property managers; from a business and marketing perspective as well as the regulatory environment. We operate in various disparate jurisdictions and markets and have limited insight into trends that may develop in those markets and may affect our business. Since we began offering such services, there have been and continue to be significant business, marketing and regulatory developments. Operating in new and untested jurisdictions requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot assure that our expansion efforts will be successful, and the investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth may not produce the desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nIf we fail to attract and maintain a critical mass of vacation rental listings and travelers, our vacation rental marketplaces will become less valuable and this may have a negative impact on our business.\nIn our vacation rental business, revenue is generated when owners and/or travelers pay us fees upon booking a transaction, owners or managers pay us fees to list and market vacation rental properties to users who visit the websites comprising our marketplace and property managers pay us fees for email and telephone leads from potential travelers or fees upon booking a transaction. As a result, our success in this area primarily depends on our ability to attract owners, managers, travelers and advertisers to our marketplace. If property owners and managers do not perceive the benefits of marketing their properties through our websites, or elect to list them with a competitor instead of listing with us, our volume of new listings and listing renewals may suffer. As a result, we may be unable to offer a sufficient supply and variety of vacation properties to attract travelers to our websites. Larger competitors already exist in the vacation rental space, with significantly more users, listed properties and financial resources.\nWe may be subject to claims that we violated intellectual property rights of others and these claims can be extremely costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages and limit our ability to operate.\nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of those intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and may in the future receive, notices that claim we have misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims also could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using technology or content found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. We might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, or content, which could require significant effort and expense and make us less competitive in the relevant market. Any of these results could harm our business and financial performance.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business and present new challenges and risks.\nWe have invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital, and issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions. We may decide to make minority investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have limited or no management or operational control. The controlling person in such case may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and decisions of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment. Further, we may issue shares of our common stock in these transactions, which could result in dilution to our stockholders.\nIf the businesses we have acquired or invested in do not perform as expected or we are unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nWe have acquired a number of businesses in the past and our future growth may depend, in part, on future acquisitions, any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There are certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions that may have a material impact on our business including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nExpected and unexpected costs incurred in identifying and pursuing acquisitions, and performing due diligence on potential acquisition targets that may or may not be successful;\n\u00b7\nUse of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in funding acquisitions that may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nAmortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and other adverse accounting consequences; Diversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from our existing business;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties and expenses in integrating the operations, products, technology, privacy protection systems, information systems or personnel of the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nThe assumption of known and unknown debt and liabilities of the acquired company, including costs associated with litigation and other claims relating to the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nFailure of any acquired company to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flows or to retain key management or employees;\n\u00b7\nFailure to generate adequate returns on acquisitions and investments;\n\u00b7\nEntrance into markets in which we have no direct prior experience and increased complexity in our business;\n\u00b7\nImpairment of goodwill or other intangible assets such as trademarks or other intellectual property arising from acquisitions; and\n\u00b7\nAdverse market reaction to acquisitions.\nMoreover, we rely heavily on the representations and warranties provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies, including as they relate to ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements. Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, results of operations and business could be harmed.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which places substantial demands on management and our operational infrastructure. We continue to make substantial investments in our technology, sales and marketing and community management organizations. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees, including employees in international markets, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our company culture. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our platform and efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could harm our brand, results of operations and business.\nOur international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks increases as our business continues to expand globally.\nWe operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United States and continue to expand our international operations. Many of these regions have different economic conditions, languages, currencies, consumer expectations, levels of consumer acceptance and\nuse of the Internet for commerce, legislation, regulatory environments (including labors laws and customs), tax laws and levels of political stability. We are subject to associated risks typical of international businesses, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nPolitical instability;\n\u00b7\nThreatened or actual acts of terrorism;\n\u00b7\nAbility to comply with additional laws applicable to companies operating internationally as well as local laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti-competition regulations;\n\u00b7\nDiminished ability to legally enforce contractual rights;\n\u00b7\nIncreased risk and limits on enforceability of intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on, or adverse consequences related to, the withdrawal of non-U.S. investment and earnings;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on repatriation of cash as well as restrictions on investments in operations in certain countries;\n\u00b7\nFinancial risk arising from transactions in multiple currencies as well as currency exchange restrictions;\n\u00b7\nSlower adoption of the Internet as an advertising, broadcast and commerce medium in certain of those markets as compared to the United States;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in managing staff and operations due to distance, time zones, language and cultural differences; and\n\u00b7\nUncertainty regarding liability for services, content and intellectual property rights, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of precedent.\nWe have a business operating in China, which creates particular risks and uncertainties relating to the laws in China. The laws and regulations of China restrict foreign investment in areas including air-ticketing and travel agency services, Internet content provision, mobile communication and related businesses. Although we have established effective control of our Chinese business through a series of agreements, future developments in the interpretation or enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations or a dispute relating to these agreements could restrict our ability to operate or restructure this business or to engage in strategic transactions. The success of this business, and of any future investments in China, is subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the application, development and interpretation of China\u2019s laws and regulations.\nFurthermore, we are also accumulating a greater portion of our cash flows in foreign jurisdictions than previously, which we consider indefinitely reinvested. The repatriation of such funds for use in the United States, including for corporate purposes such as acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or debt refinancings, may result in additional U.S. income tax expense and higher cost for such capital.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.\nOur future success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior corporate management and other key employees. In particular, the contributions of Stephen Kaufer, our President and Chief Executive Officer, are critical to our overall management. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of these individuals, and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could seriously harm our business. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.\nIn addition, competition remains intense for well-qualified employees in certain aspects of our business, including software engineers, developers, product management and development personnel, and other technology professionals. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees, our business would be adversely affected.\nA failure to comply with current laws, rules and regulations or changes to such laws, rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business or financial performance.\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws, rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to us and our business, including those relating to the Internet and online commerce, Internet advertising, consumer protection, data security and privacy. Unfavorable changes could decrease demand for products and services, limit marketing methods and capabilities, increase costs and/or subject us to additional liabilities.\nFor example, there is, and will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the Internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet, online editorial and user-generated content, user privacy, data security, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, liability for third-party activities and the quality of products and services. Our current business partner arrangements with third parties, including Facebook, could be negatively impacted to the extent that more restrictive privacy laws or regulations are enacted, particularly in the United States or European Union. In addition, enforcement authorities in the United States continue to rely on their authority under existing consumer protection laws to take action against companies relating to data privacy and security practices. The growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts, which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally.\nWe also have been subject, and we will likely be subject in the future, to inquiries from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with consumer protection, competition, tax and travel industry-specific laws and regulations. The failure of our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against us by governmental agencies and/or consumers, which if material, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market, our compliance with such laws may put us a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis competitors who do not comply with such requirements.\nThe promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations, or the new interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations, in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide services could require us to change certain aspects of our business, operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenues, increase costs and/or subject the company to additional liabilities.\nWe cannot be sure that our intellectual property is protected from copying or use by others, including potential competitors.\nOur websites rely on content, brands and technology, much of which is proprietary. We protect our proprietary content, brands and technology by relying on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and confidentiality agreements. In connection with our license agreements with third parties, we seek to control access to, and the use and distribution of, proprietary technology, content and brands. Even with these precautions, it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology, content or brands without authorization or to develop similar technology, content or brands independently. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which our services are made available, and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our business or ability to compete. We cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement our intellectual property. Any misappropriation or violation of our rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, we may need to go to court or other tribunals or administrative bodies in order to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Our failure to protect our intellectual property in a cost-effective or effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to protect our technology, content and brands.\nWe currently license from third parties and incorporate the technologies and content into our websites. As we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies and content, we may be required to license additional technology, or content. We cannot be sure that such technology or content will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nSystem interruption and the lack of redundancy in some of our internal information systems may harm our business.\nWe rely on computer systems to deliver content and services. We have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently providing content and services to users and third parties. Significant interruptions, outages or delays in internal systems, or systems of third parties that we rely upon, or deterioration in the performance of any such systems, would impair our ability to process transactions or display content and decrease the quality of the services we offer to travelers and users. These interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption (called \u201cdenial of service\u201d or \u201cbot\u201d attacks). If we were to experience frequent or persistent system failures, our business, reputation, and brand could be harmed.\nWe do not have a completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business and our backup systems and disaster recovery, business continuity /or contingency plans for certain critical aspects of our operations or business processes may not be sufficient. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time. Although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets, any of these\nevents could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing content and services to users, travelers and/or third parties for a significant period of time. If we experience frequent or persistent system failures, our reputation and brand could be permanently and significantly harmed. In addition, remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs. Moreover, the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain.\nOur processing, storage and use personal information and other data exposes us to risks of external and internal security breaches and could give rise to liabilities.\nThere are numerous laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other consumer data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. In addition, the security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential to maintaining consumer and travel service provider confidences in our services. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements that could harm our reputation and cause our customers and members to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business, brand, market share and results of operations.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the Internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet. Various U.S. courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes, including computer trespass and wiretapping laws, to the collection and exchange of information online. In addition, the European Union is in the process of proposing reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies, including us, with users in Europe and increased costs of compliance.\nPotential security breaches to our systems, whether resulting from internal or external sources, could significantly harm our business. A party, whether internal or external, that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate user information or proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in our operations. In the past, we have experienced \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our websites unavailable for short periods of time as well as unauthorized access of our systems and data. We have acquired a number of companies over the years and may continue to do so in the future. While we make significant efforts to address any information technology security issues with respect to our acquisitions, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate the acquired businesses. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to investigate and address problems caused by breaches, and reductions in website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident. Because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Security breaches could result in negative publicity, damage to reputation, exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions. Security breaches could also cause travelers and potential users to lose confidence in our security, which would have a negative effect on the value of our brand. Failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions, whether for our own systems or systems of vendors, could expose us to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance.\nWe also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties conducting business over the Internet. Much of our business is conducted with third party marketing affiliates or, more recently, though business partners powering our instant booking feature. In addition, we frequently use third parties to process credit card payments. A security breach at such third party could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of our systems and could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions. In addition, such third parties may not comply with applicable disclosure requirements, which could expose us to liability.\nWe face increased risks as the level of our debt increases.\nOn June 26, 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement with respect to a $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility. These arrangements include restrictive covenants that may impact the way we manage our business and may limit our ability to secure significant additional financing in the future on favorable terms. Our ability to secure additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to then prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and\ncredit markets, there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments.\nWe have indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe currently have outstanding approximately $200 million in long-term debt. Risks relating to our indebtedness include:\n\u00b7\nIncreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nRequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nMaking it more difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our businesses;\n\u00b7\nLimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nPossibly placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u00b7\nLimiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms that we find acceptable; and\n\u00b7\nExposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because our outstanding debt is expected to be subject to variable rates of interest.\nIn addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. The terms of our revolving credit facility will allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations; however, there is no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on terms favorable to us, if at all. In addition, if new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.\nThe agreements that govern our revolving credit facility contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants. The failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are party to a credit agreement providing for the revolving credit facility. The agreements that govern the revolving credit facility contain various covenants, including those that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nIncur indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nPay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u00b7\nEnter into certain asset sale transactions, including partial or full spin-off transactions;\n\u00b7\nEnter into secured financing arrangements;\n\u00b7\nEnter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u00b7\nEnter into unrelated businesses.\nThese covenants may limit our ability to optimally operate our business. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests, including a leverage ratio test. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility may result in an event of default under the agreements governing such facilities. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the debt incurred thereunder. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds (including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings).\nOur effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results.\nDue to the global nature of our business, we are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. In the event we incur net income in certain jurisdictions but incur losses in other jurisdictions, we generally cannot offset the income from one jurisdiction with the loss from another, which could increase our effective tax rate. Furthermore, significant judgment is required to calculate our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. By virtue of our previously filed separate company and consolidated income tax returns with Expedia we are routinely under audit by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions\nand accruals. The results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nAdditionally, we earn an increasing portion of our income, and accumulate a greater portion of cash flow, in foreign jurisdictions, which we consider indefinitely reinvested. Any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and incremental cash tax payments. In addition, there have been proposals to amend U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact the manner in which U.S. companies are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any legislation will pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our U.S. tax expense and cash flows.\nWe are subject to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange risk.\nWe conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States but report our results in U.S. dollars. As a result, we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, particularly those related to the Euro, British pound sterling, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar, and Chinese renminbi. These exposures include, but are not limited to re-measurement of gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities; translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation; and planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur.\nDepending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates, if we were to choose not to hedge or were to fail to hedge effectively our exposure, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition. As seen in some recent periods, in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates the impact of these exposures can increase, and the impact on results of operations can be more pronounced. In addition, the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business have made hedging these exposures both more complex and costly. We hedge certain short-term foreign currency exposures with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only help mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counter-party failure. There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects.\nSignificant fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect consumer travel behavior. Volatility in foreign exchange rates and its impact on consumer behavior, which may differ across regions, makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on our markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nUnder the Tax Sharing Agreement between us and Expedia entered into in connection with the Spin-Off, we are generally required to indemnify Expedia for any taxes resulting from the Spin-Off (and any related interest, penalties, legal and professional fees, and all costs and damages associated with related stockholder litigation or controversies) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) any act or failure to act by us described in the covenants in the tax sharing agreement, (ii) any acquisition of our equity securities or assets or those of a member of our group, or (iii) any failure of the representations with respect to us or any member of our group to be true or any breach by us or any member of our group of any covenant, in each case, which is contained in the separation documents or in the documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel.\nWe continue to be responsible for potential tax liabilities in connection with consolidated income tax returns filed with Expedia prior to or in connection with the Spin-Off. We are currently under an IRS audit for the 2009 and 2010 tax years, and have various ongoing state income tax audits. These audits include questioning of the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The outcome of these matters or any other audits could subject us to significant tax liabilities.\nLiberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. currently is a controlling stockholder.\nLiberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc., or LTRIP, effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders (other than with respect to the election by the holders of our common stock of 25% of the members of our Board of Directors and matters as to which Delaware law requires separate class votes, including but not limited to, corporate transactions such as mergers, business combinations or dispositions of assets, the authorization or issuance of new equity or debt securities and determinations with respect to our business direction and policies). LTRIP, which has investments in other companies, may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders and they may vote in a way with which our other stockholders may not agree or that may be adverse to other stockholders\u2019 interests. LTRIP is not restricted from investing in other businesses involving or related to our business. Liberty\u2019s control of us, as well as the existing provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law, may discourage or prevent a change of control of us, which may reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe are currently relying on the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption under NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Rules, pursuant to which \u201ccontrolled companies\u201d are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements otherwise applicable under NASDAQ listing rules.\nThe NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Rules exempt \u201ccontrolled companies,\u201d or companies of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company, from certain corporate governance requirements, including those requirements that:\n\u00b7\nA majority of the Board of Directors consist of independent directors;\n\u00b7\nCompensation of officers be determined or recommended to the Board of Directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and\n\u00b7\nDirector nominees be selected or recommended to the Board of Directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nWe currently rely on the controlled company exemption from the above requirements. Accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections generally as stockholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements.\nIf we are unable to successfully maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and our stock price and business may be adversely impacted.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and our management is required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. Additionally, we are required to disclose in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K our management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a registered public accounting firm\u2019s attestation report on this assessment. If we are not successful in maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, there could be inaccuracies or omissions in the consolidated financial information we are required to file with the SEC. Additionally, even if there are no inaccuracies or omissions, we could be required to publicly disclose the conclusion of our management that our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. These events could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, adversely impact our stock price, result in increased costs to remediate any deficiencies, attract regulatory scrutiny or lawsuits that could be costly to resolve and distract management\u2019s attention, limit our ability to access the capital markets or cause our stock to be delisted from NASDAQ or any other securities exchange on which we are then listed.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile and may face negative pressure.\nOur stock price has experienced, and could continue to experience in the future, substantial volatility. The market price of our common stock is affected by a number of factors, including the risk factors described in this section and other factors beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock could include:\n\u00b7\nQuarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u00b7\nChanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nFailure to meet market expectations;\n\u00b7\nThe announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nRepurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program which could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock;\n\u00b7\nDevelopments in our industry, including changes in governmental regulations; and\n\u00b7\nGeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors related to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations and general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nFor the period ended December 31, 2015, the average daily trading volume of our common stock on NASDAQ was approximately 2.0 million shares. If our existing stockholders or their distributees sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of the common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress the trading price of our common stock. In addition, certain stockholders have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If LTRIP or some other stockholder sells substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if there is a perception in the public market that LTRIP might sell shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our Board of Directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\n\u00b7\nAuthorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the Board of Directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of our common stock; and\n\u00b7\nProhibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies or calling special stockholder meetings.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board of Directors, including a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 13168, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "TRIP"}
