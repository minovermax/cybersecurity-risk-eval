{"cik": "1562476", "company": "Taylor Morrison Home Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks related to our industry and our business\nOur business is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions.\nOur business can be substantially affected by adverse changes in general economic or business conditions that are outside of our control, including changes in:\n\u2022\nshort- and long-term interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of financing for homebuyers;\n\u2022\nemployment levels, job and personal income growth and household debt-to-income levels;\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular;\n\u2022\nthe ability of existing homeowners to sell their existing homes at prices that are acceptable to them;\n\u2022\nU.S. and global financial system and credit markets, including stock market and credit market volatility;\n\u2022\nprivate and federal mortgage financing programs and federal and state regulation of lending practices;\n\u2022\nfederal and state income tax provisions, including provisions for the deduction of mortgage interest payments;\n\u2022\nhousing demand from population growth and demographic changes (including immigration levels and trends in urban and suburban migration);\n\u2022\ndemand from foreign buyers for our homes, which may fluctuate according to economic circumstances in foreign markets;\n\u2022\nthe supply of available new or existing homes and other housing alternatives, such as apartments and other residential rental property;\n\u2022\nreal estate taxes; and\n\u2022\nthe supply of developable land in our markets and in the United States generally.\nAdverse changes in these conditions may affect our business nationally or may be more prevalent or concentrated in particular regions or localities in which we operate. During the most recent economic downturn, unfavorable changes in many of the above factors negatively affected all of the markets we serve. Economic conditions in all our markets continue to be characterized by levels of uncertainty, which has impacted business or consumer confidence in those markets. For example, fluctuations in oil and gas prices may create economic uncertainty, particularly in regions of Texas where we have significant operations. Any deterioration in economic conditions or continuation of uncertain economic conditions would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, a public health issue such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect economic conditions. The U.S. and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public perception of health risk. In the event of a widespread, prolonged, actual or perceived outbreak of a contagious disease, our operations could be negatively impacted by a reduction in customer traffic or other factors that could reduce demand for new homes.\nInclement weather, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and fires), and other environmental conditions may delay the delivery of our homes and/or increase our costs. Civil unrest or acts of terrorism, or other acts of violence or threats to national security, may also have a negative effect on our business.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions can cause demand and prices for our homes to diminish or cause us to take longer to build our homes and make it more costly for us to do so. We may not be able to recover these increased costs by raising prices because of weak market conditions and because the price of each home we sell is usually set several months before the home is delivered, as many customers sign their home purchase contracts before construction begins. The potential difficulties described above could impact our customers\u2019 ability to obtain suitable financing and cause some homebuyers to cancel or refuse to honor their home purchase contracts altogether.\nThe recent improvement in housing market conditions follows a significant downturn, and the likelihood of a full recovery is uncertain in the current state of the economy. A slowdown in our business could have additional adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn connection with the most recent downturn in the U.S. housing market, we incurred substantial losses, after impairments, in our U.S. operations during 2008 and 2009. Although the U.S. housing market continues to recover, we cannot predict the extent of further recovery or its timing. Some markets and submarkets have been stronger than others. We expect that such unevenness will continue, whether or not the present housing recovery progresses and prevailing conditions in various housing markets and submarkets will continue to fluctuate. These fluctuations may be significant and unfavorable. In addition, while some of the many negative factors that contributed to the housing downturn may have moderated, several remain, and they could return and/or intensify to inhibit any future improvement in housing market conditions in 2015.\nIn addition, as a result of the recent disposition of our Canadian business, we are more exposed to economic conditions in the United States and are therefore less diversified than we were prior to the disposition. Consequently, our results of operations may be more volatile in the future than they have been historically.\nThough we have taken steps to alleviate the impact of these conditions on our business, given the most recent downturn in the homebuilding industry and global economic uncertainty, there can be no guarantee that steps taken by us will continue to be effective, and to the extent the current economic environment does not improve or any improvement takes place over an extended period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf homebuyers are not able to obtain suitable financing, our results of operations may decline.\nA substantial majority of our homebuyers finance their home purchases through lenders that provide mortgage financing. The availability of mortgage credit remains constrained, due to various regulatory changes and lower risk appetite by lenders, with many lenders requiring increased levels of financial qualification, including lenders adhering to the new \u201cQualified Mortgage\u201d requirements and ability to repay standard, and lending lower multiples of income. Investors and first-time homebuyers are generally more affected by the availability of financing than other potential homebuyers. These buyers are a key source of our demand. A limited availability of home mortgage financing may adversely affect the volume of our home sales and the sales prices we achieve.\nDuring the last several years, the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant instability, beginning with increased defaults on subprime loans and other nonconforming loans and compounded by expectations of increasing interest payments requirements and further defaults. Lending requirements and standards remain tightened and as a result, investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities has declined. The liquidity provided by government sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the FHA and Veterans Administration, to the mortgage industry has been very important to the housing market. Several federal government officials have proposed changing the nature of the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the federal government and even nationalizing or eliminating these entities entirely. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were dissolved or if the federal government determined to stop providing liquidity support to the mortgage market, there would be a reduction in the availability of the financing provided by these institutions. Any such reduction would likely have an adverse effect on interest rates, mortgage availability and our sales of new homes. For instance, in March 2014, a proposal was introduced in the U.S. Senate to overhaul the mortgage market by replacing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with a new system of federally insured mortgage securities. The proposal may not be enacted, and its effects on the residential mortgage market are not predictable at this time. Such an overhaul may reduce the availability of residential mortgage loans or increase the cost of such loans to borrowers, which could materially and adversely affect both our homebuilding and Mortgage Operations businesses.\nThe FHA insures mortgage loans that generally have lower loan payment requirements and qualification standards compared to conventional guidelines, and as a result, continue to be a particularly important source for financing the sale of our homes. In recent years, lenders have taken a more conservative view of FHA guidelines causing significant tightening of borrower eligibility for approval. Further restrictions are expected on FHA-insured loans, including limitations on seller-paid closing costs and concessions. This or any other restriction may negatively affect the\navailability or affordability of FHA financing, which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes in the U.S. In addition, changes in federal regulatory and fiscal policies relating to currently available benefits for homeowners (including a repeal of the currently available home mortgage interest tax deduction) may also negatively affect potential homebuyers\u2019 ability to purchase homes.\nIn each of our markets, decreases in the availability of credit and increases in the cost of credit adversely affect the ability of homebuyers to obtain or service mortgage debt. Even if potential homebuyers do not themselves need mortgage financing, where potential homebuyers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a new home, increases in mortgage costs, lack of availability of mortgages and/or regulatory changes could prevent the buyers of potential homebuyers\u2019 existing homes from obtaining a mortgage, which would result in our potential customers\u2019 inability to buy a new home. Similar risks apply to those buyers who are awaiting delivery of their homes and are currently in backlog. The success of homebuilders depends on the ability of potential homebuyers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of homes. If our customers (or potential buyers of our customers\u2019 existing homes) cannot obtain suitable financing our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAn inability to obtain additional performance, payment and completion surety bonds and letters of credit could limit our future growth.\nWe are often required to provide performance, payment and completion and warranty/maintenance surety bonds or letters of credit to secure the completion of our construction contracts, development agreements and other arrangements. We have obtained credit facilities to provide the required volume of performance, payment and completion and warranty maintenance surety bonds and letters of credit for our expected growth in the medium term; however, unexpected growth may require additional facilities. We may also be required to renew or amend our existing facilities. Our ability to obtain additional performance, payment and completion and warranty/maintenance surety bonds and letters of credit primarily depends on our credit rating, capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and certain external factors, including the capacity of the markets for such bonds. Performance, payment and completion and warranty/maintenance surety bond and letter of credit providers consider these factors in addition to our performance and claims record and provider-specific underwriting standards, which may change from time to time.\nIf our performance record or our providers\u2019 requirements or policies change, if we cannot obtain the necessary consent from our lenders, or if the market\u2019s capacity to provide performance, payment and completion or warranty/maintenance bonds or letters of credit is not sufficient for any unexpected growth and we are unable to renew or amend our existing facilities on favorable terms or at all, we could be unable to obtain additional performance, payment and completion and warranty/maintenance surety bonds or letters of credit from other sources when required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHigher cancellation rates of existing agreements of sale may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur backlog reflects sales contracts with our homebuyers for homes that have not yet been delivered. We have received a deposit from a homebuyer for each home reflected in our backlog, and generally we have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to retain the deposit if the homebuyer fails to comply with his or her obligations under the sales contract, including as a result of state and local law, the homebuyer\u2019s inability to sell his or her current home or the homebuyer\u2019s inability to make additional deposits required prior to the closing date. If prices for new homes decline, if competitors increase their use of sales incentives, if interest rates increase, if the availability of mortgage financing diminishes or if there is a downturn in local or regional economies or in the national economy, U.S. homebuyers may terminate their existing home purchase contracts with us in order to negotiate for a lower price or because they cannot, or will not, complete the purchase and our remedies generally do not extend beyond the retention of deposits as our liquidated damages.\nCancellation rates may rise in the future. If uncertain economic conditions in the U.S. continue, if mortgage financing becomes less available or if current homeowners find it difficult to sell their current homes, more homebuyers may cancel their sales contracts with us. As a result, our financial condition may deteriorate and you may lose a portion of your investment.\nIn cases of cancellation, we remarket the home and usually retain any deposits we are permitted to retain. Nevertheless, the deposits may not cover the additional costs involved in remarketing the home, replacing installed options, reducing the sales price or increasing incentives on the completed home for greater marketability and carrying higher inventory. Further, depending on the stage of cancellation, a contract that is cancelled at the end of a phase may cause additional construction costs, roadway repairs or added nuisances to existing homeowners for the out of sequence construction or modification of the one home. Significant numbers of cancellations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe homebuilding and mortgage services industries are highly competitive and, if our competitors are more successful or offer better value to our customers, our business could decline.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other homebuilders in each market in which we operate. We compete with large national and regional homebuilding companies and with smaller local homebuilders for land, financing, affiliated or in-house services, raw materials and skilled management, volume discounts, local REALTOR\u00ae and labor resources. We also compete with the resale, or \u201cpreviously owned,\u201d home market. Increased competition could cause us to increase our selling incentives and reduce our prices. An oversupply of homes available for sale and the heavy discounting of home prices by some of our competitors have adversely affected demand for our homes and the results of our operations in the past and could do so again in the future. Our Mortgage Operations business competes with other mortgage lenders and title companies, including national, regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions, some of which are subject to fewer government regulations. Mortgage lenders who are subject to fewer regulations or have greater access to capital or different lending criteria may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers. If we are unable to compete effectively in our homebuilding and mortgage services markets, our business could decline disproportionately to our competitors, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAny increase in unemployment or underemployment may lead to an increase in the number of loan delinquencies and property repossessions and have an adverse impact on us.\nIn the U.S., the unemployment rate was 5.7% as of January 2015, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (\u201cBLS\u201d). In addition, the labor force participation rate reported by the BLS has been declining, from 66.2% in January 2008 to 62.9% in January 2015, potentially reflecting an increased number of \u201cdiscouraged workers\u201d who have left the labor force. In addition, a substantial portion of new jobs created have been relatively low-wage jobs or part-time jobs. People who are not employed, are underemployed, who have left the labor force or are concerned about low wages or the loss of their jobs are less likely to purchase new homes, may be forced to try to sell the homes they own and may face difficulties in making required mortgage payments. Therefore, any increase in unemployment or underemployment may lead to an increase in the number of loan delinquencies and property repossessions and have an adverse impact on us both by reducing demand for the homes we build and by increasing the supply of homes for sale.\nIncreases in taxes, government fees or interest rates could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results.\nSignificant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage interest and real estate taxes, generally are deductible expenses for an individual\u2019s U.S. federal, and in some cases, state income taxes, subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy. If the U.S. federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws, as has been discussed from time to time, to eliminate, limit or substantially modify these income tax deductions, the after-tax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers. The resulting loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions, if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions, or any other increase in any taxes affecting homeowners, would adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes.\nIncreases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding, can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes. Fees imposed on developers to fund schools, open spaces, road improvements, and/or provide low and moderate income housing, could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, increases in sales taxes could\nadversely affect our potential customers who may consider those costs in determining whether to make a new home purchase and decide, as a result, not to purchase one of our homes.\nIn addition, increases in interest rates as a result of changes to monetary policy could significantly increase the costs of owning a home, which in turn would adversely impact demand for and sales prices of homes and the ability of potential customers to obtain financing and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nInflation or deflation could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, materials and labor. In the event of an increase in inflation, we may seek to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins. However, an oversupply of homes relative to demand and home prices being set several months before homes are delivered may make any such increase difficult or impossible. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which historically had a negative impact on housing demand. In such an environment, we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease. Moreover, the cost of capital increases as a result of inflation and the purchasing power of our cash resources declines. Current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nAlternatively, a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. This could lead to a further deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance, which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Declining oil and gas prices may increase the risk of significant deflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate because of the seasonal nature of our business and other factors.\nOur quarterly operating results generally fluctuate by season and also because of the uneven delivery schedule of certain of our products and communities.\nHistorically, a larger percentage of our agreements of sale have been entered into in the winter and spring. Weather-related problems, typically in the fall, late winter and early spring, may delay starts or closings and increase costs and thus reduce profitability. Seasonal natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and fires could cause delays in the completion of, or increase the cost of, developing one or more of our communities, causing an adverse effect on our sales and revenues.\nIn many cases, we may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices because we set our prices up to 12 months in advance of delivery upon signing the home sales contract. In addition, deliveries may be staggered over different periods of the year and may be concentrated in particular quarters. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate because of these factors.\nNegative publicity may affect our business performance and could affect our stock price.\nUnfavorable media related to our industry, company, brands, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance, or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business, regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. Our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment. Adverse publicity or negative commentary on social media outlets, such as blogs, websites or newsletters, could hurt operating results, as consumers might avoid brands that receive bad press or negative reviews. Negative publicity may result in a decrease in our operating results.\nHomebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.\nAs a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business. There can be no assurance that any developments we undertake will be free from defects once completed. Construction defects may occur on projects and developments and may arise during a significant period of time after completion. Defects arising on a development attributable to us may lead to significant contractual or other liabilities.\nAs a consequence, we maintain products and completed operations excess liability insurance, obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors generally covering claims related to damages resulting from faulty workmanship and materials, and create warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the risks associated with the types of homes built. Although we actively monitor our insurance reserves and coverage, because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction defect claims in the future. In addition, contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce. We may also be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of products and completed operations excess liability insurance for construction defects is currently limited and costly. This coverage may be further restricted or become more costly in the future.\nIn 2005 and 2006, we discontinued requiring insurance policies from most of our contractors in California and instead adopted an Owner Controlled Insurance Plan (\u201cOCIP\u201d) for general liability exposures of most subcontractors (excluding consultants), as a result of the inability of subcontractors to procure acceptable insurance coverage to meet our requirements. Under the OCIP, subcontractors are effectively insured by us. We have assigned risk retentions and bid deductions to our subcontractors based on their risk category. These deductions are used to fund future liabilities.\nUnexpected expenditures attributable to defects or previously unknown sub-surface conditions arising on a development project may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, severe or widespread incidents of defects giving rise to unexpected levels of expenditure, to the extent not covered by insurance or redress against sub-contractors, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur reliance on contractors can expose us to various liability risks.\nWe rely on contractors in order to perform the construction of our homes, and in many cases, to select and obtain raw materials. We are exposed to various risks as a result of our reliance on these contractors and their respective subcontractors and suppliers, including, as described above, the possibility of defects in our homes due to improper practices or materials used by contractors, which may require us to comply with our warranty obligations and/or bring a claim under an insurance policy. Several other homebuilders have received inquiries from regulatory agencies concerning whether homebuilders using contractors are deemed to be employers of the employees of such contractors under certain circumstances. Although contractors are independent of the homebuilders that contract with them under normal management practices and the terms of trade contracts and subcontracts within the homebuilding industry, if regulatory agencies reclassify the employees of contractors as employees of homebuilders, homebuilders using contractors could be responsible for wage, hour and other employment-related liabilities of their contractors. In the event that a regulatory agency reclassified the employees of our contractors as our own employees, we could be responsible for wage, hour and other employment-related liabilities of our contractors.\nFailure to manage land acquisitions, inventory and development and construction processes could result in significant cost overruns or errors in valuing sites.\nWe own and purchase a large number of sites each year and are therefore dependent on our ability to process a very large number of transactions (which include, among other things, evaluating the site purchase, designing the layout of the development, sourcing materials and sub-contractors and managing contractual commitments) efficiently and accurately. Errors by employees, failure to comply with regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules, failings or inadequacies in internal control processes, equipment failures, natural disasters or the failure of external systems,\nincluding those of our suppliers or counterparties, could result in operational losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and our relationships with our customers.\nIn certain circumstances, a grant of entitlements or development agreement with respect to a particular parcel of land may include restrictions on the transfer of such entitlements to a buyer of such land, which may increase our exposure to decreases in the price of such entitled land by restricting our ability to sell it for its full entitled value. In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing community or market. In recent periods of market weakness, we have sold homes and land for lower margins or at a loss and we have recorded significant inventory impairment charges, and such conditions may recur. The recording of a significant inventory impairment could negatively affect our reported earnings per share and negatively impact the market perception of our business.\nIf land and lots are not available at competitive prices, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur long-term profitability depends in large part on the price at which we are able to obtain suitable land and lots for the development of our communities. Increases in the price (or decreases in the availability) of suitable land and lots could adversely affect our profitability. Moreover, changes in the general availability of desirable land, competition for available land and lots, limited availability of financing to acquire land and lots, zoning regulations that limit housing density, environmental requirements and other market conditions may hurt our ability to obtain land and lots for new communities at prices that will allow us to be profitable. If the supply of land and lots that are appropriate for development of our communities becomes more limited because of these factors, or for any other reason, the cost of land and lots could increase and the number of homes that we are able to build and sell could be reduced, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the market value of our land inventory decreases, our results of operations could be adversely affected by impairments and write-downs.\nThe market value of our land and housing inventories depends on market conditions. We acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets. There is an inherent risk that the value of the land owned by us may decline after purchase. The valuation of property is inherently subjective and based on the individual characteristics of each property. We may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably. In addition, our deposits for lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk. Factors such as changes in regulatory requirements and applicable laws (including in relation to building regulations, taxation and planning), political conditions, the condition of financial markets, both local and national economic conditions, the financial condition of customers, potentially adverse tax changes, and interest and inflation rate fluctuations subject valuations to uncertainty. Moreover, all valuations are made on the basis of assumptions that may not prove to reflect economic or demographic reality. If housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory, our profitability may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build houses.\nDue to economic conditions in the U.S. in recent years, including increased amounts of home and land inventory that entered certain U.S. markets from foreclosure sales or short sales, the market value of our land and home inventory was negatively impacted prior to 2011. Write-downs and impairments have had an adverse effect (and any further write-downs may also have an adverse effect) on our business, financial condition and operating results. We recorded no inventory impairments in 2011, 2012, 2013 or the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2011, the carrying value of all of our land was adjusted to its fair market value as of the date of the Acquisition. We regularly review the value of our land holdings and continue to review our holdings on a periodic basis. Further material write-downs and impairments in the value of our inventory may be required, and we may in the future sell land or homes at a loss, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we experience shortages in labor supply, increased labor costs or labor disruptions, there could be delays or increased costs in developing our communities or building homes, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe require a qualified labor force to develop our communities and build our homes. Access to qualified labor may be affected by circumstances beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nwork stoppages resulting from labor disputes;\n\u2022\nshortages of qualified trades people, such as carpenters, roofers, electricians and plumbers, especially in our key markets in the southwest U.S.;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws relating to union organizing activity;\n\u2022\nchanges in immigration laws and trends in labor force migration; and\n\u2022\nincreases in sub-contractor and professional services costs.\nAny of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of, or could increase the cost of, developing one or more of our communities and building homes. We may not be able to recover these increased costs by raising our home prices because the price for each home is typically set months prior to its delivery pursuant to sales contracts with our homebuyers. In such circumstances, our operating results could be adversely affected. Additionally, market and competitive forces may also limit our ability to raise the sales prices of our homes.\nFailure to recruit, retain and develop highly skilled, competent people at all levels, including finding suitable subcontractors, may have a material adverse effect on our standards of service.\nKey employees, including management team members, are fundamental to our ability to obtain, generate and manage opportunities. Key employees working in the homebuilding and construction industries are highly sought after. Failure to attract and retain such personnel or to ensure that their experience and knowledge are not lost when they leave the business through retirement, redundancy or otherwise may adversely affect the standards of our service and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and operating results. In addition, we do not maintain key person insurance in respect of any member of our senior management team. The loss of any of our management members or key personnel could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe vast majority of our work carried out on site is performed by subcontractors. The difficult operating environment over the last six years in the U.S. has resulted in the failure of some subcontractors\u2019 businesses and may result in further failures. In addition, reduced levels of homebuilding in the U.S. have led to some skilled tradesmen leaving the industry to take jobs in other sectors. If subcontractors are not able to recruit sufficient numbers of skilled employees, our development and construction activities may suffer from delays and quality issues, which would also lead to reduced levels of customer satisfaction.\nGovernment regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our communities, increase our expenses or limit our homebuilding or other activities, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe approval of numerous governmental authorities must be obtained in connection with our development activities, and these governmental authorities often have broad discretion in exercising their approval authority. We incur substantial costs related to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Any increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs, or in some cases cause us to determine that the property is not feasible for development. Various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning building, health and safety, site and building design, environment, zoning, sales and similar matters apply to and/or affect the housing industry. We are also subject to various fees and charges of government authorities designed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements.\nMunicipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. If municipalities in which we operate take such actions, it could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays, increasing our costs or limiting our ability to operate in those municipalities.\nCertain states, cities and counties in which we operate have in the past approved, or approved for inclusion on their ballot, various \u201cslow growth\u201d or \u201cno growth\u201d initiatives and other ballot measures that could negatively impact the availability of land and building opportunities within those localities. These measures may reduce our ability to open new home communities and to build and sell homes in the affected markets, including with respect to land we may already own, and create additional costs and administration requirements, which in turn may harm our future sales, margins and earnings. A further expansion of these measures or the adoption of new slow-growth, no-growth or other similar programs could exacerbate such risks.\nEnvironmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials, such as lumber.\nIn addition, there is a variety of new legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment at the federal, state and local level relating to energy and climate change. This legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our cost to construct homes. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and become more costly to comply with. Similarly, energy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the U.S. and the world and because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, they could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy related regulations.\nGovernmental regulation affects not only construction activities but also sales activities, mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers. In addition, it is possible that some form of expanded energy efficiency legislation may be passed by the U.S. Congress or federal agencies and certain state legislatures, which may, despite being phased in over time, significantly increase our costs of building homes and the sale price to our buyers, and adversely affect our sales volumes. We may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed communities, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties.\nOur Mortgage Operations business may be adversely affected by changes in governmental regulation and other risks associated with acting as a mortgage lender.\nWhile we intend for the loans originated by TMHF, our Mortgage Operations business, to typically be held for no more than 20 days before being sold on the secondary market, if TMHF is unable to sell loans into the secondary mortgage market or directly to large secondary market loan purchasers such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, TMHF would bear the risk of being a long-term investor in these originated loans. Mortgage lending is subject to credit risks associated with the borrowers to whom the loans are extended and an increase in default rates could have a material and adverse effect on our business. Being required to hold loans on a long-term basis would also negatively affect our liquidity and could require us to use additional capital resources to finance the loans that TMHF is extending. In addition, although mortgage lenders under the mortgage warehouse facilities TMHF currently uses to finance our lending operations normally purchase our mortgages within 20 days of origination, if such mortgage lenders default under these warehouse facilities TMHF would be required to fund the mortgages then in the pipeline. In such case, amounts available under our Restated Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and cash from operations may not be sufficient to allow TMHF to provide financing required by our business during these times.\nAn obligation to commit our own funds to long-term investments in mortgage loans could, among other things, delay the time when we recognize revenues from home sales on our statements of operations. If, due to higher costs, reduced liquidity, heightened risk retention obligations and/or new operating restrictions or regulatory reforms related to or arising from compliance with new U.S. federal laws and regulations, residential consumer loan putback demands or internal or external reviews of its residential consumer mortgage loan foreclosure processes, or other factors or business decisions, TMHF could be unable to make loan products available to our homebuyers, and home sales and mortgage services results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, changes in governmental regulation with respect to mortgage lenders could adversely affect the financial results of this portion of our business. Our mortgage lending operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. There have been numerous changes and proposed changes in these regulations as a result of the housing downturn. For example, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted. Among other things, this legislation provides for minimum standards for mortgages and lender practices in making mortgages, limitations on certain fees, retention of credit risk, prohibition of certain tying arrangements and remedies for borrowers in foreclosure proceedings. In January 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed a number of new rules that became effective in January 2014, including but not limited to rules regarding the creation and definition of a \u201cQualified Mortgage\u201d, rules for lender practices regarding assessing borrowers\u2019 ability to repay, and limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements. The effects of these rules upon their adoption could affect the availability and cost of mortgage credit. Other requirements provided for by the Dodd-Frank Act have not yet been finalized or implemented. The effect of such provisions on our Mortgage Operations business will depend on the rules that are ultimately enacted. Any such changes or new enactments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market perception of our business.\nThe prices of our mortgages could be adversely affected if we lose any of our important commercial relationships.\nTMHF has longstanding relationships with members of the lender community from which its borrowers benefit. TMHF plans to continue with these relationships and use the correspondent lender platform as a part of its operational plan. If our relationship with any one or more of those banks deteriorates or if one or more of those banks decide to renegotiate or terminate existing agreements or otherwise exit the market, TMHF may be required to increase the price of our products, or modify the range of products TMHF offers, which could cause us to lose customers who may choose other providers based solely on the price or fees, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to use certain deferred tax assets, which may result in our having to pay substantial taxes.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets, including net operating losses in the U.S. that could be used to offset earnings and reduce the amount of taxes we are required to pay. Our ability to use net operating losses to offset earnings is dependent on a number of factors, including applicable rules relating to the permitted carry back period for offsetting certain net operating losses against prior period earnings and the timing and amount of future taxable income.\nRaw materials and building supply shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of home construction and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe homebuilding industry has, from time to time, experienced raw material shortages and been adversely affected by volatility in global commodity prices. In particular, shortages and fluctuations in the price of concrete, drywall, lumber or other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of, or increase the cost of, developing one or more of our residential communities.\nIn addition, the cost of petroleum products, which are used both to deliver our materials and to transport workers to our job sites, fluctuates and may be subject to increased volatility as a result of geopolitical events or accidents such as the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico. Changes in such costs could also result in higher prices for any product utilizing petrochemicals. These cost increases may have an adverse effect on our operating margin and results of operations. Furthermore, any such cost increase may adversely affect the regional economies in which we operate and reduce demand for our homes.\nThe geographic concentration of our operations subjects us to an increased risk of loss of revenue or decreases in the market value of our land and homes in these regions from factors which may affect any of these regions.\nOur operations are concentrated in California, Colorado, Arizona, Texas and Florida. Some or all of these regions could be affected by:\n\u2022\nsevere weather;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\nshortages in the availability or increased costs in obtaining land, equipment, labor or building supplies;\n\u2022\nchanges to the population growth rates and therefore the demand for homes in these regions; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory and fiscal environment.\nDue to the concentrated nature of our operations, negative factors affecting one or a number of these geographic regions at the same time could result in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of operations. The markets we operate in may also depend, to a degree, on certain sectors of the economy and any declines in those sectors may impact home sales and activities in that region. For example, to the extent the oil and gas industries, which can be very volatile, are negatively impacted by declining commodity prices, climate change, legislation or other factors, it could result in reduced employment, or other negative economic consequences, which in turn could adversely impact our home sales and activities, particularly in Texas.\nChanges to the population growth rates in certain of the markets in which we operate could affect the demand for homes in these regions.\nSlower rates of population growth or population declines in our key markets, especially as compared to the high population growth rates in prior years, could affect the demand for housing, causing home prices in these markets to fall, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe participate in certain unconsolidated joint ventures where we may be adversely impacted by the failure of the unconsolidated joint venture or the other partners in the unconsolidated joint venture to fulfill their obligations.\nWe have investments in and commitments to certain unconsolidated joint ventures with related and unrelated strategic partners to acquire and develop land and, in some cases, build and deliver homes. To finance these activities, our unconsolidated joint ventures often obtain loans from third-party lenders that are secured by the unconsolidated joint venture\u2019s assets. To the extent any of our joint ventures default on obligations secured by the assets of such joint venture, the assets could be forfeited to third-party lenders.\nWe have provided non-recourse carve-out guarantees to certain third-party lenders to our unconsolidated joint ventures (i.e. guarantees of losses suffered by the lender in the event that the borrowing entity or its equity owners engage in certain conduct, such as fraud, misappropriation of funds, unauthorized transfers of the financed property or equity interests in the borrowing entity, or the commencement of a voluntary bankruptcy case by the borrowing entity, or the borrowing entity violates environmental law, or hazardous materials are located on the property, or under other circumstances provided for in such guarantee or indemnity). In the future, we may provide other guarantees and indemnities to such lenders, including secured guarantees, in which case we may have increased liability in the event that a joint venture defaults on its obligations to a third party.\nIf the other partners in our unconsolidated joint ventures do not provide such cooperation or fulfill these obligations due to their financial condition, strategic business interests (which may be contrary to ours), or otherwise, we may be required to spend additional resources (including payments under the guarantees we have provided to the unconsolidated joint ventures\u2019 lenders) and suffer losses, each of which could be significant. Moreover, our ability to recoup such expenditures and losses by exercising remedies against such partners may be limited due to potential legal defenses they may have, their respective financial condition and other circumstances. Furthermore, the termination of a joint venture may also give rise to lawsuits and legal costs.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nWe use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities as well as maintain our business records, including information provided by our customers. Many of these resources are provided to us and/or maintained on our behalf by third-party service providers pursuant to agreements that specify certain security and service level standards. Our ability to conduct our business may be impaired if these resources are compromised, degraded, damaged or fail, whether due to a virus or other harmful circumstance, intentional penetration or disruption of our information technology resources by a third party, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption\nor failure or error (including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software), telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions (including the failure to follow our security protocols), or lost connectivity to our networked resources. A significant and extended disruption in the functioning of these resources could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, sales and revenue.\nIn addition, breaches of our data security systems, including by cyber-attacks, could result in the unintended public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary, personal and confidential information (including confidential information about our employees, consumers who view our homes, homebuyers, mortgage loan borrowers and business partners), and require us to incur significant expense to address and resolve these kinds of issues. The release of confidential information may also lead to identity theft and related fraud, litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals and/or business partners and/or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the costs of maintaining adequate protection against such threats, as they develop in the future (or as legal requirements related to data security increase) could be material.\nWe may incur a variety of costs to engage in future growth or expansion of our operations or acquisitions or disposals of businesses, and the anticipated benefits may never be realized.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we may make acquisitions, or significant investments in, and/or disposals of businesses. Any future acquisitions, investments and/or disposals would be accompanied by risks such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies or businesses;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\nour potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation or disposition of operations;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022\nimpairment of existing relationships with employees, contractors, suppliers and customers as a result of the integration of new management personnel and cost-saving initiatives.\nFor example, our recent disposition of Monarch requires the separation of our operations and personnel from those of Monarch, as well as our performance of the related transition services agreement. This creates additional expense and requires the allocation of management resources. We provided a customary indemnity to Monarch under the transition services agreement, which could create further expense. The disposition may result in decreased earnings, revenue or cash flow and may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and operating results. The disposition may also result in lost synergies that could negatively impact our balance sheet, income statement and cash flows.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate any company or business that we might acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could harm our current business.\nIn addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and there may be other unanticipated or unidentified effects. While we would seek protection, for example, through warranties and indemnities in the case of acquisitions, significant liabilities may not be identified in due diligence or come to light after the expiry of warranty or indemnity periods. Additionally, while we would seek to limit our ongoing exposure, for example, through liability caps and period limits on warranties and indemnities in the case of disposals, some warranties and indemnities may give rise to unexpected and significant liabilities. Any claims arising in the future may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We may not able to manage the risks associated with these transactions and the effects of such transactions, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and operating results.\nWe have defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes to which we may be required to increase our contributions to fund deficits.\nWe provide retirement benefits for former and certain of our current employees through a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. Certain of these plans are no longer available to new employees. As of December 31, 2014, we had recorded a deficit of $10.2 million in our defined benefit pension plans. This deficit may increase, and we may be required to increase contributions to our plans in the future, which may materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nBuilding sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the homebuilding industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of projects we work on, health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities, and our ability to attract customers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOwnership, leasing or occupation of land and the use of hazardous materials carries potential environmental risks and liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, rules and regulations concerning land use and the protection of health and the environment, including those governing discharge of pollutants to water and air, storm water run-off, the presence of and exposure to asbestos, the handling of hazardous materials and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We may be liable for the costs of removal, investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances located on, under or in a property currently or formerly owned, leased or occupied by us, whether or not we caused or knew of the pollution. The costs of any required removal, investigation or remediation of such substances or the costs of defending against environmental claims may be substantial. The presence of such substances, or the failure to remediate such substances properly, may also adversely affect our ability to sell the land or to borrow using the land as security. Environmental impacts from historical activities have been identified at some of the projects we have developed in the past and additional projects may be located on land that may have been contaminated by previous use. Although we are not aware of any projects requiring material remediation activities by us as a result of historical contamination, no assurances can be given that material claims or liabilities relating to such developments will not arise in the future.\nThe particular impact and requirements of environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site, the site\u2019s environmental conditions and the present and former use of the site. We expect that increasingly stringent requirements may be imposed on homebuilders in the future. Environmental laws may result in delays, cause us to implement time consuming and expensive compliance programs and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas, such as wetlands. We also may not identify all of these concerns during any pre-development review of project sites. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials, such as lumber. Furthermore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties and other sanctions and damages from third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of our failure to comply with, or liabilities under, applicable environmental laws and regulations. In addition, we are subject to third-party challenges, such as by environmental groups, under environmental laws and regulations to the permits and other approvals required for our projects and operations. These matters could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be liable for claims for damages as a result of use of hazardous materials.\nAs a homebuilding business with a wide variety of historic homebuilding and construction activities, we could be liable for future claims for damages as a result of the past or present use of hazardous materials, including building materials\nwhich in the future become known or are suspected to be hazardous. Any such claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Insurance coverage for such claims may be limited or non-existent.\nWe may suffer uninsured losses or suffer material losses in excess of insurance limits.\nWe could suffer physical damage to property and liabilities resulting in losses that may not be fully compensated by insurance. In addition, certain types of risks, such as personal injury claims, may be, or may become in the future, either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may not be currently or in the future covered by our insurance policies. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could sustain financial loss or lose capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated future income from that property. In addition, we could be liable to repair damage or meet liabilities caused by uninsured risks. We may be liable for any debt or other financial obligations related to affected property. Material losses or liabilities in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future.\nIn the U.S., the coverage offered and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects is currently limited and is costly. As a result, an increasing number of our subcontractors in the U.S. may be unable to obtain insurance, particularly in California where we have instituted an OCIP, under which subcontractors are effectively insured by us. If we cannot effectively recover construction defect liabilities and costs of defense from our subcontractors or their insurers, or if we have self-insured, we may suffer losses. Coverage may be further restricted and become even more costly. Such circumstances could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may face substantial damages or be enjoined from pursuing important activities as a result of existing or future litigation, arbitration or other claims.\nWe are involved in various litigation and legal claims in the normal course of our business operations, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. We are also subject to a variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations related to land development activities, house construction standards, sales practices, mortgage lending operations, employment practices, and protection of the environment. As a result, we are subject to periodic examination or inquiry by various governmental agencies that administer these laws and regulations.\nWe establish liabilities for legal claims and regulatory matters when such matters are both probable of occurring and any potential loss is reasonably estimable. We accrue for such matters based on the facts and circumstances specific to each matter and revise these estimates as the matters evolve. In such cases, there may exist an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts currently accrued. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these legal and regulatory matters, we generally cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the pending matters, the related timing, or the eventual loss. While the outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, to the extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter exceeds the estimates reflected in the recorded reserves relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that could be significant.\nPoor relations with the residents of our communities could negatively impact sales, which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.\nResidents of communities we develop rely on us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities. Efforts made by us to resolve these issues or disputes could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation. In addition, we could be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes or to modify our community development plans, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on certain members of our management and key personnel.\nOur business involves complex operations and therefore demands a management team and employee workforce that is knowledgeable and expert in many areas necessary for our operations. Our performance and success are dependent, in part, upon key members of our management and personnel, and their loss or departure could be detrimental to our future\nsuccess. Further, the process of attracting and retaining suitable replacements for key personnel whose services we may lose would result in transition costs and would divert the attention of other members of our senior management from our existing operations. In addition, we do not maintain key person insurance in respect of any members of our senior management team. The loss of any of our management members or key personnel could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nUtility and resource shortages or rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nSeveral of the markets in which we operate have historically been subject to utility and resource shortages, including significant changes to the availability of electricity and water. Shortages of natural resources in our markets, particularly of water, may make it more difficult for us to obtain regulatory approval of new developments. We have also experienced material fluctuations in utility and resource costs across our markets, and we may incur additional costs and may not be able to complete construction on a timely basis if such fluctuations arise. Our lumber inventory is particularly sensitive to these shortages. Furthermore, these shortages and rate fluctuations may adversely affect the regional economies in which we operate, which may reduce demand for our homes and negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nConstriction of the capital markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital.\nWe fund our operations from cash from operations, capital markets financings and borrowings under our Restated Revolving Credit Facility and other credit facilities. Volatile economic conditions and the constriction of the capital markets could reduce the sources of liquidity available to us and increase our costs of capital. If the size or availability of our banking facilities is reduced in the future, or if we are unable to renew existing facilities in the future on favorable terms, it would have an adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $252.3 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months. We believe we can meet this and our other capital requirements with our existing cash resources and future cash flows and, if required, other sources of financing that we anticipate will be available to us. However, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so, particularly if industry or economic conditions deteriorate. The future effects on our business, liquidity and financial results of these conditions could be adverse, both in the ways described above and in other ways that we do not currently foresee.\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt-related obligations.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2014, the total principal amount of our debt (including $160.8 million of indebtedness of TMHF) was $1.7 billion. Our substantial debt could have important consequences for the holders of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt or to our trade or other creditors;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and the proceeds of any capital markets offerings for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us through capital markets financings or under our Restated Revolving Credit Facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations or to repay existing indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional debt or equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. We cannot assure you that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.\nRestrictive covenants in the indentures governing our 2020 Senior Notes, our 2021 Senior Notes and the agreements governing our Restated Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe indentures governing our 2020 Senior Notes, our 2021 Senior Notes (as defined below) and the agreement governing our Restated Revolving Credit Facility limit our ability, and the terms of any future indebtedness may limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock;\n\u2022\nsell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nagree to restrictions on distributions, transfers or dividends affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nincur liens; and\n\u2022\ndesignate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nThe agreement governing the Restated Revolving Credit Facility contains certain \u201cspringing\u201d financial covenants requiring TMM Holdings and its subsidiaries to comply with a certain maximum capitalization ratio and a certain minimum consolidated tangible net worth test. The agreement governing the Restated Revolving Credit Facility also contains customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on incurrence of liens, the payment of dividends and other distributions, the making of asset dispositions, investments, sale and leasebacks, and limitations on debt payments and amendments. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Annual Report.\nThe restrictions contained in the indentures governing all of our Senior Notes and the agreement governing our Restated Revolving Credit Facility could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans.\nA breach of any of the restrictive covenants under the agreements governing our Restated Revolving Credit Facility or any of our Senior Notes could allow for the acceleration of both the Restated Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Notes. If the indebtedness under our Restated Revolving Credit Facility or the Senior Notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Annual Report.\nWe may require additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us.\nThe expansion and development of our business may require significant capital, which we may be unable to obtain, to fund our capital expenditures and operating expenses, including working capital needs. During 2014, 2013 and 2012 we made expenditures for land and development of $1.0 billion, $897.1 million and $656.9 million, respectively.\nDuring the next 12 months, we expect to meet our cash requirements with existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations (including sales of our homes and land), proceeds from the disposition of Monarch and borrowings under our Restated Revolving Credit Facility. We may fail to generate sufficient cash flow from the sales of our homes and land to meet our cash requirements. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated or we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities.\nTo a large extent, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity, or obtain additional equity or debt financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow, refinance our indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms could adversely affect our financial condition and could cause us to be unable to service our debt and may delay or prevent the expansion of our business.\nRisks related to our structure and organization\nTMHC\u2019s only asset is its interest in TMM Holdings II Limited Partnership (\u201cNew TMM\u201d), and accordingly it is dependent upon distributions from New TMM to pay dividends, if any, taxes and other expenses. New TMM is a holding company with no operations of its own and, in turn, relies on distributions from TMM Holdings and its operating subsidiaries.\nTMHC is a holding company and has no assets other than its ownership, directly or indirectly, of New TMM Units. TMHC has no independent means of generating revenue. TMHC intends to cause New TMM to make distributions to its partners in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes payable and dividends, if any, declared by TMHC. To the extent that TMHC needs funds, and New TMM is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially and adversely affect TMHC\u2019s liquidity and financial condition. In addition, New TMM has no direct operations and derives all of its cash flow from TMM Holdings and its subsidiaries. Because the operations of TMHC\u2019s business are conducted through subsidiaries of TMM Holdings, New TMM is dependent on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet the financial obligations of New TMM. Legal and contractual restrictions in the agreements governing the Restated Revolving Credit Facility, certain of the Senior Notes and other debt agreements governing current and future indebtedness of New TMM\u2019s subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of New TMM\u2019s subsidiaries, may limit TMHC\u2019s ability to obtain cash from New TMM\u2019s subsidiaries. The earnings from, or other available assets of, New TMM\u2019s subsidiaries may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to TMHC to enable TMHC to pay any dividends on the Class A Common Stock, taxes and other expenses.\nThe Principal Equityholders have substantial influence over our business, and their interests may differ from our interests or those of our other stockholders.\nThe Principal Equityholders, via the TPG and Oaktree Holding Vehicles, hold a majority of the combined voting power of TMHC. Due to their ownership, our Principal Equityholders have the power to control us and our subsidiaries, including the power to:\n\u2022\nelect a majority of our directors and appoint our executive officers, set our management policies and exercise overall control over the Company and subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nagree to sell or otherwise transfer a controlling stake in the Company; and\n\u2022\ndetermine the outcome of substantially all actions requiring stockholder approval, including transactions with related parties, corporate reorganizations, acquisitions and dispositions of assets, and dividends.\nThe interests of our Principal Equityholders may differ from our interests or those of our other stockholders and the concentration of control in our Principal Equityholders will limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. The concentration of ownership and voting power of our Principal Equityholders may also delay, defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third party or other change of control of the Company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of our Principal Equityholders, even if such events are perceived by the other stockholders as being in their best interest. The concentration of voting power among our Principal Equityholders may have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A Common Stock. The Company may take actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and cause the value of your investment to decline.\nPursuant to the stockholders agreement, to which TMHC is a party, along with the TPG and Oaktree Holding Vehicles and JH, certain of our actions require the approval of the directors nominated by the TPG and Oaktree Holding Vehicles. Specifically, the approval of a director nominated by the TPG Holding Vehicle, so long as it owns at least 50% of TMHC\u2019s common stock held by it at the closing of our IPO (and the application of net proceeds therefrom), and the approval of a director nominated by the Oaktree Holding Vehicle, so long as it owns at least 50% of TMHC\u2019s common stock held by it following our IPO (and the application of net proceeds therefrom), must be obtained before we are permitted to take any of the following actions:\n\u2022\nany change of control of TMHC;\n\u2022\nacquisitions or dispositions by TMHC or any of its subsidiaries of assets valued at more than $50.0 million;\n\u2022\nincurrence by TMHC or any of its subsidiaries of any indebtedness in an aggregate amount in excess of $50.0 million or the making of any loan in excess of $50.0 million;\n\u2022\nissuance of any equity securities of TMHC, subject to limited exceptions (which include issuances pursuant to approved compensation plans);\n\u2022\nhiring and termination of our Chief Executive Officer; and\n\u2022\ncertain changes to the size of our Board of Directors.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is defined to include persons owning directly or indirectly 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation. We have elected in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Nevertheless, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, except that they provide that the TPG and Oaktree Holding Vehicles and their respective affiliates and transferees will not be deemed to be \u201cinterested stockholders,\u201d regardless of the percentage of our voting stock owned by them, and accordingly will not be subject to such restrictions.\nIn addition, because the Principal Equityholders hold their economic interest in our business through New TMM, but not through TMHC, the public company, these existing owners may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our Class A Common Stock.\nAs a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange, we qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, holders of our Class A Common Stock may not have the same degree of protection as that afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of these exchanges.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange as a result of the ownership position and voting rights of our Principal Equityholders. A \u201ccontrolled company\u201d is a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company. More than 50% of our voting power is held by the TPG and Oaktree Holding Vehicles. As a controlled company, we are entitled to elect, and have elected, not to comply with certain corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange that would otherwise require the Board of Directors to have a majority of independent directors and our compensation and nominating and governance committees to be comprised entirely of independent directors, have written charters addressing such committees\u2019 purposes and responsibilities and perform an annual evaluation of such committees. Accordingly, holders of our Class A Common Stock do not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and the ability of our independent directors to influence our business policies and affairs may be reduced.\nTMHC\u2019s directors who have relationships with the Principal Equityholders may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving the Company.\nThe majority of TMHC\u2019s directors are affiliated with the Principal Equityholders. These persons have fiduciary duties to TMHC and in addition have duties to the Principal Equityholders. In addition, TMHC\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of TMHC who is also an officer, director, employee or other affiliate of the Principal Equityholders or an officer, director or employee of an affiliate of the Principal Equityholders will be liable to TMHC or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to the Principal Equityholders or their affiliates instead of TMHC, or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to TMHC that such person or affiliate has directed to the Principal Equityholders or their affiliates. As a result, such circumstances may entail real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting both TMHC and the Principal Equityholders, whose interests, in some circumstances, may be adverse to those of TMHC. In addition, as a result of the Principal Equityholders\u2019 indirect ownership interest, conflicts of interest could arise with respect to transactions involving business dealings between TMHC and the Principal Equityholders or their affiliates, including potential business transactions, potential acquisitions of businesses or properties, the issuance of additional securities, the payment of dividends by TMHC and other matters.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and the trading price of our securities.\nAs a public company we are required to document and test our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules of the SEC, which require, among other things, our management to assess annually the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on management\u2019s assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, it could lead to material misstatements in our financial statements, we may be unable to meet our disclosure obligations and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information. Failure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or other regulatory authorities.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party, which might diminish the value of our Class A Common Stock. Provisions in our debt agreements may also require an acquirer to refinance our outstanding indebtedness if a change of control occurs.\nIn addition to the TPG and Oaktree Holding Vehicles holding a majority of the voting power of TMHC, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain certain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent\na change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable, including the following, some of which may only become effective when the TPG and Oaktree Holding Vehicles no longer beneficially own shares representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of our common stock (the \u201cTriggering Event\u201d):\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes and the election of each class for three-year terms;\n\u2022\nthe sole ability of the board of directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u2022\nafter the Triggering Event, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and to take action by written consent;\n\u2022\nafter the Triggering Event, in certain cases, the approval of holders of at least three-fourths of the shares entitled to vote generally on the making, alteration, amendment or repeal of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will be required to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws, or amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\nafter the Triggering Event, the required approval of holders of at least three-fourths of the shares entitled to vote at an election of the directors to remove directors, which removal may only be for cause; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used, among other things, to institute a rights plan that would have the effect of significantly diluting the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d We have elected in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Nevertheless, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, except that they provide that the TPG and Oaktree Holding Vehicles and their respective affiliates and transferees will not be deemed to be \u201cinterested stockholders,\u201d and accordingly will not be subject to such restrictions.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in the acquisition.\nUnder our Restated Revolving Credit Facility, a change of control would be an event of default, which would therefore require a third party acquirer to obtain a facility to refinance any outstanding indebtedness under the Restated Revolving Credit Facility. Under the indentures governing our Senior Notes, if a change of control were to occur, we would be required to make offers to repurchase the Senior Notes at prices equal to 101% of their respective principal amounts. These change of control provisions in our existing debt agreements may also delay or diminish the value of an acquisition by a third party.\nAny of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our Class A Common Stock and Senior Notes.", "PERMNO": 13862, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "TMHC"}
