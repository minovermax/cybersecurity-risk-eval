{"cik": "1637655", "company": "Horizon Global Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. Some of our risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate, while others relate to the securities markets in general and ownership of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nRisks Relating to our Business and our Industry\nOur businesses depend upon general economic conditions and we serve some customers in highly cyclical industries; as such, we may be subject to the loss of sales and margins due to an economic downturn or recession.\nOur financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve in both the U.S. and global economies. Some of the industries that we serve are highly cyclical, such as the agricultural, automotive, construction, horse/livestock, industrial, marine, military, recreational, trailer and utility markets. We may experience a reduction in sales and margins as a result of a downturn in economic conditions or other macroeconomic factors. Lower demand for our products may also negatively affect the capacity utilization of our production facilities, which may further reduce our operating margins.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt. To service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. If we cannot generate the required cash, we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our debt.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had total debt of $240.9 million (without giving effect to the equity component of our convertible senior notes or any debt discount). Our ability to make payments on our debt, fund our other liquidity needs, and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and we anticipate that our future financial results will be, subject to fluctuations. Our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe degree to which we are currently leveraged could have important consequences for shareholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on acceptable terms and conditions to enable us to react to changes in our business; or\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.\nAdditionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our revolving credit facility, first lien term loan and second lien term loan restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our revolving credit facility, first lien term loan and second lien term loan contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nissue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nalter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our revolving credit facility, first lien term loan and second lien term loan require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Although we entered into amendments to these agreements in March 2019 and September 2019 to, among other things, provide for a relaxation of certain of our financial covenants, our ability to meet the financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under agreements governing our revolving credit facility, first lien term loan and second lien term loan could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our revolving credit facility, first lien term loan and second lien term loan those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; and\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing.\nMany of the markets we serve are highly competitive, which could limit the volume of products that we sell and reduce our operating margins.\nMany of our products are sold in competitive markets. We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality and price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, reliability and timeliness of delivery, customer service and effectiveness of distribution. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support of our distribution networks. We may have insufficient resources in the future to continue to make such investments and, even if we make such investments, we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position. We also face the risk of lower-cost foreign manufacturers located in China, Southeast Asia, India and other regions competing in the markets for our products, and we may be driven as a consequence of this competition to increase our investment overseas. Making overseas investments can be highly complicated and we may not always realize the advantages we anticipate from any such investments. Competitive pressure may limit the volume of products that we sell and reduce our operating margins.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our business strategies. Our ability to realize our business strategies may be limited.\nOur businesses operate in relatively mature industries and it may be difficult to successfully pursue our growth strategies and realize material benefits therefrom. Even if we are successful, other risks attendant to our businesses and the economy generally may substantially or entirely eliminate the benefits.\nWe may not achieve our strategic goals for margin expansion, capital structure improvement and organic growth. Our past performance in these areas may not be indicative of future performance. Failure to achieve our strategic goals may adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur strategic platforms for value creation and goals for margin expansion, capital structure improvement and organic growth are subject to risk and uncertainty and depend on general economic, credit, capital market and other conditions that are beyond our control and are subject to fluctuation. Our past performance with respect to margin expansion, capital structure improvement and organic growth should be considered independent from, and may not be a reliable indicator of, future performance. These strategic goals may need to be revised or may not be met for a number of reasons, including changes in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, changes in credit and capital market conditions, increased competition in the markets for our products, increases in raw material or energy costs and changes in technology and manufacturing techniques.\nIncreases in our raw material or energy costs or the loss of critical suppliers could adversely affect our profitability and other financial results.\nWe are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base. Our largest material purchases are for steel, copper and aluminum. The prices for these products have historically been volatile, fluctuate with worldwide market and economic conditions, import duties and tariffs, and may increase as a result of various factors, including: a reduction in the number of suppliers due to restructuring, bankruptcies and consolidations, declining supply due to mine or mill closures and other factors that adversely impact supplier profitability, including increases in supplier operating expenses caused by rising raw material and energy costs. We may be unable to completely offset the impact with price increases on a timely basis due to outstanding commitments to our customers, competitive considerations or our customers\u2019 resistance to accepting such price increases and our financial performance may be adversely impacted by further price increases. A failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with certain raw materials or component parts on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, for any reason, including, without limitation, disruptions in our suppliers\u2019 business due to cybersecurity incidents, terrorist activity, public health crises (such as the coronavirus (COVID-19)), fires or other natural disasters, could have a material adverse effect on us. To the extent there are energy supply disruptions or material fluctuations in energy costs, our margins could be materially adversely impacted.\nThe U.S. government has indicated its intent to alter its approach to trade policy, including, in some instances, to revise, renegotiate or terminate certain multilateral trade agreements. It has also imposed new tariffs on certain foreign goods and raised the possibility of imposing additional increases or new tariffs on other goods. Such actions have, in some cases, led to retaliatory trade measures by certain foreign governments. Such policies could make it more difficult or costly for us to do business in or procure products from those countries. In turn, we may need to raise prices or make changes to our operations, which could negatively impact our revenue or operating results. At this time, it remains unclear what additional actions, if any, will be taken by the U.S. government or foreign governments with respect to tariff and international trade agreements and policies, and we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any revised trade agreements or any impact on our business.\nOur products are typically highly engineered or customer-driven and we are subject to risks associated with changing technology and manufacturing techniques that could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of product quality, price competitiveness, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design capability, manufacturing expertise, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. Our success depends on our ability to continue to meet our customers\u2019 changing expectations with respect to these criteria. We anticipate that we will remain committed to product research and development, advanced manufacturing techniques and service to remain competitive, which entails significant costs. We may be unable to address technological advances, implement new and more cost-effective manufacturing techniques, or introduce new or improved products, whether in existing or new markets, so as to maintain our businesses\u2019 competitive positions or to grow our businesses as desired.\nWe depend on the services of key individuals, the loss of which could materially harm us.\nOur success will depend, in part, on the efforts of our senior management. Our future success will also depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key employees or the failure to attract or retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on us.\nA future impairment of our intangible assets or goodwill could have a material negative impact on our financial results.\nAt December 31, 2019, our intangible assets and goodwill were $60.1 million and $4.4 million, respectively. Intangibles and goodwill each represented 14% and 1% of our total assets, respectively. If we experience declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet our current and forecasted operating budget, we may be subject to future impairment charges. Because of the significance of these assets, any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may face liability associated with the use of products for which patent ownership or other intellectual property rights are claimed.\nWe may be subject to claims or inquiries regarding alleged unauthorized use of a third party\u2019s intellectual property. An adverse outcome in any intellectual property litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others, require us to comply with injunctions to cease marketing or using certain products or brands, or require us to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand certain products or packaging, any of which could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we may not be able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the cost of responding to an intellectual property infringement claim, in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources, whether or not the claim is valid, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property.\nWhile we believe that our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property have significant value, it is uncertain that this intellectual property or any intellectual property acquired or developed by us in the future, will provide a meaningful competitive advantage. Our patents or pending applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by competitors or rights granted thereunder may not provide meaningful proprietary protection. Moreover, competitors may infringe on our patents or successfully avoid them through design innovation. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive, and we may not be able to, or have the resources to, prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States. The cost of protecting our intellectual property may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, recall and warranty claims that may be brought against us.\nA significant product liability lawsuit, warranty claim or product recall involving us could adversely affect our financial performance. In the event that our products fail to perform as expected, regardless of fault, and such failure results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims or we may be required to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. Further, any product liability or warranty issues may adversely affect our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality, safe products, divert management\u2019s attention, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently carry insurance and maintain reserves for potential product liability and recall claims. However, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise and any liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have been able to obtain insurance in amounts we believe to be appropriate to cover such liability to date, our insurance premiums may increase in the future as a consequence of conditions in the insurance business generally or our situation in particular. Any such increase could result in lower net income or cause the need to reduce our insurance coverage. Any product liability claim may also include the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to certain state laws, may not be covered by insurance. Our product liability insurance policies have limits that, if exceeded, may result in material costs that could have an adverse effect on our future profitability. In addition, warranty claims are generally not covered by our product liability insurance.\nOur business may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations at the local, state, national and international levels, and existing and any new laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges and chemical and hazardous waste management, could affect our general business operations. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners\u2019 or operators\u2019 releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment and compliance with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. However, the nature of our operations and\nour long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities.\nWhile we must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords, current laws and regulations have not had a material impact on our business, capital expenditures or financial position. We cannot assess the financial or operational impact of future regulatory changes; however, future events, including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas regulation, could require us to incur expenses related to the modification or curtailment of operations, installation of pollution control equipment or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites.\nOur access to new capital may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.\nAs part of our ongoing business, we are exposed to certain market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates and uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve policies. An increase in interest rates may result in tighter capital markets, increasing the cost and reducing the availability of debt financing. Restricted access to debt financing could impact that availability of working capital and may adversely affect us.\nWe have significant operating lease obligations and our failure to meet those obligations could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe lease many of our manufacturing facilities and certain capital equipment. Our rent expense in 2019 under these operating leases was $18.8 million. A failure to pay our rental obligations would constitute a default allowing the applicable landlord to pursue any remedy available to it under applicable law, which would include taking possession of our property and, in the case of real property, evicting us. These leases are categorized as operating leases and are not considered indebtedness for purposes of our debt instruments.\nWe may be subject to further unionization and work stoppages at our facilities or our customers may be subject to work stoppages, which could seriously impact the profitability of our business.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 27% of our work force was unionized under several different unions. We are not aware of any present active union organizing drives at any of our other facilities. We cannot predict the impact of any further unionization of our workplace. Future labor disagreements could result in work stoppages. Any prolonged work stoppages at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany of our direct or indirect customers have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these customers or their suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of assembly plants where our products are included. In addition, organizations responsible for shipping our customers\u2019 products may be impacted by occasional strikes or other activity. Any interruption in the delivery of our customers\u2019 products could reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur healthcare costs for active employees and future retirees may exceed our projections and may negatively affect our financial results.\nWe provide healthcare benefits for active employees through comprehensive hospital, surgical and major medical benefit provisions, all of which are subject to various cost-sharing features. If our costs under our benefit programs for active employees exceed our projections, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, foreign competitors and many domestic competitors provide fewer benefits to their employees, and this difference in cost could adversely impact our competitive position.\nA portion of our sales is derived from international sources, which exposes us to certain risks which may adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nWe have operations outside of the United States. For 4Q19 YTD, 47.5% of our net sales were derived from sales by our subsidiaries located outside of the United States. In addition, we may expand our international operations through internal growth and acquisitions. International operations, particularly sales to emerging markets and manufacturing in non-U.S. countries, are subject to risks which are not present within U.S. markets, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in local government regulations and policies including, but not limited to, governmental embargoes, repatriation of earnings, expropriation of property, duty or tariff restrictions, investment limitations and tax policies;\n\u2022\nchanges in local economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and disruptions, including labor unrest, civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;\n\u2022\nlegislation that regulates the use of chemicals;\n\u2022\ndisadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d);\n\u2022\ncompliance with international trade laws and regulations, including export control and economic sanctions, such as anti-dumping duties;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022\ntax inefficiencies in repatriating cash flow from non-U.S. subsidiaries that could affect our financial results and reduce our ability to service debt;\n\u2022\nreduced protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nincreasingly complex laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation;\n\u2022\nthe impacts related to the United Kingdom\u2019s successful referendum to exit the European Union; and\n\u2022\nother risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas where our operations are conducted.\nWe are also exposed to risks relating to U.S. policy with respect to companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions, particularly in light of the current U.S. presidential administration. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on import from countries where we procure or manufacture products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For instance, the U.S. and Chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported goods. With respect to the automotive industry, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel, aluminum and automotive components, with China imposing retaliatory tariffs on certain automotive components. Given the uncertainty regarding the duration of the imposed tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs by the United States, China or other countries, as well as other changes in tax policy, trade regulations or trade agreements, and the Company\u2019s ability to implement strategies to mitigate the impact of changes in tax policy, tariffs or other trade regulations, our exposure to the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAlthough our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in foreign currencies. Our sales and profitability are impacted by the movement of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in the countries in which we generate sales and conduct operations. Long-term fluctuations in relative currency values could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws as well as export controls and economic sanction laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate these regulations. Any violation could cause an adverse effect on operations and financial conditions. Additionally, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial condition.\nOur reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.\nWhile we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws or fail to protect our confidential information, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering, and data privacy laws, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such allegations, violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance, could damage our reputation and could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nOur acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies include indemnification provisions that may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities. Moreover, we remain subject to continuing indemnification liabilities in connection with the Spin-off.\nCertain of the agreements related to the acquisition of businesses require indemnification against certain liabilities related to the operations of the company for the previous owner. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may incur unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position.\nAdditionally, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with TriMas that provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to affect the Spin-off, certain conditions to the Spin-off and provisions governing the relationship between our company and TriMas with respect to and resulting from the Spin-off. Among other things, the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our Cequent business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Spin-off, as well as those obligations of TriMas assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement. If we are required to indemnify TriMas under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nMoreover, pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, TriMas agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that TriMas has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from TriMas will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that TriMas will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from TriMas any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these liabilities ourselves. If TriMas is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, TriMas\u2019 insurers may deny coverage to us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the Spin-off. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from such insurance providers, we may be required to temporarily bear such loss of coverage.\nPotential liabilities associated with certain assumed obligations under the tax sharing agreement cannot be precisely quantified at this time.\nUnder the tax sharing agreement with TriMas, we are responsible generally for certain taxes paid after the Spin-off attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, whether accruing before, on or after the Spin-off. We have also agreed to be responsible for, and to indemnify TriMas with respect to, all taxes arising as a result of the Spin-off (or certain internal restructuring transactions) failing to qualify as transactions under Sections 368(a) and 355 of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes (which could result, for example, from a merger or other transaction involving an acquisition of our shares) to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the tax opinion relating to the Spin-off or in the tax sharing agreement. As described above, such tax liability would be calculated as though TriMas (or its affiliate) had sold its shares of common stock of our company in a taxable sale for their fair market value, and TriMas (or its affiliate) would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares. Any such tax liability could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, and products.\nWe collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to U.S. or international privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Increased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, monitoring of our networks\nand systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to compromise from advanced persistent threats, employee malfeasance, human or technological error, and other cybersecurity threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, customer relationships, competitiveness and results of operations. We may be required to incur significant costs to remedy damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches or to protect against disruption or security breaches in the future. We have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event covering expenses for notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available, or may result in increased cybersecurity and other insurance premiums.\nA major disruption or failure of our information systems could harm our business.\nWe depend on integrated information systems to conduct our business. We may experience operating problems with our information systems as a result of system disruptions, failures, viruses, computer hackers or other causes. Any significant disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause customers to cancel orders or cause standard business processes to become inefficient or ineffective. An extended interruption of standard business processes may affect our profitability and financial position.\nWe may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from acquisitions.\nThe benefits from past or future acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating acquisitions. There can be no assurance that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate past or future acquisitions. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as our convertible senior notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 470-20, \u201cDebt with Conversion and Other Options\u201d, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as our convertible senior notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for our convertible senior notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of our convertible senior notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of our convertible senior notes to their face amount over the term of the convertible senior notes. We will report lower net income in our financial statements because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible senior notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as our convertible senior notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible senior notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of our convertible senior notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible senior notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nThe conditional conversion features of our 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (\u201cConvertible Notes\u201d), if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn the event the conditional conversion features of the Convertible Notes are triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, we would be required to make cash payments to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation based on the conversion rate,\nwhich could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which could result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe convertible note hedge transactions (\u201cConvertible Note Hedges\u201d) and warrant transactions (\u201cWarrants\u201d) that we entered into in connection with the offering of our Convertible Notes and warrant transactions in connection with the second lien term loan may affect the value of the Convertible Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties. The Convertible Note Hedges are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be. We also entered into warrant transactions with each option counterparty. The Warrants could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants. In connection with establishing its initial hedge of the Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants, each option counterparty or an affiliate thereof may have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes at that time. In addition, each option counterparty or an affiliate thereof may modify its hedge position by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and is likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes. In addition, if any such Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants fail to become effective, each option counterparty may unwind its hedge position with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the Convertible Notes.\nPursuant to the second lien term loan, we issued detachable warrants to purchase up to 6.25 million shares of our common stock, which can be exercised on a cashless basis over a five-year term with an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Convertible Note Hedges.\nEach option counterparty to the Convertible Note Hedges is a financial institution, and we will be subject to the risk that it might default under the Convertible Note Hedges. Our exposure to the credit risk of an option counterparty will not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have from time to time resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with the option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any option counterparty.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWhile we are currently in compliance with the NYSE's minimum market capitalization requirement, we could be at risk of being out of compliance and of the NYSE delisting our common stock, which would have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nOn January 3, 2019, we were notified (the \u201cNotice\u201d) by the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) that we were not in compliance with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because our average market capitalization was less than $50 million over a consecutive 30 trading-day period and our stockholders\u2019 equity was less than $50 million. We submitted a plan to the NYSE indicating that we intended to seek to cure the market capitalization condition by executing our strategic plan, which resulted in improved operational and financial performance that ultimately led to a recovery of our common stock price and market capitalization and our once again being in compliance with the minimum market capitalization requirement. While we have cured this deficiency and regained compliance with this continued listing standard, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with this and other continued listing standards of the NYSE.\nA delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could negatively impact us as it would likely reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock; and negatively impact our ability to access equity markets and obtain financing.\nOur stock price may be subject to significant volatility due to our own results or market trends.\nIf our revenue, earnings or cash flows in any quarter fail to meet the investment community\u2019s expectations, there could be an immediate negative impact on our stock price. Our stock price could also be impacted by broader market trends and world events unrelated to our performance.\nOur issuance of the Convertible Notes, or the issuance of any additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn February 2017, we issued $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes may be settled in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our option. In the future, we may issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. The Convertible Notes issuance, and any future issuance of shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable into, shares of our common stock, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to the second lien term loan, we issued detachable warrants to purchase up to 6.25 million shares of our common stock, which can be exercised on a cashless basis over a five-year term with an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants.\nIn particular, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Notes upon exercise and settlement or termination of the Warrants that we entered into in connection with the Convertible Notes offering and the second lien term loan, and upon the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock awards and deferred restricted stock units to our employees. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities. In addition, the market price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible senior notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our Convertible Notes and our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or our \u201ccertificate of incorporation,\u201d and Amended and Restated Bylaws, or our \u201cbylaws,\u201d as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions, as amended and restated, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquiror from making a tender offer for our common stock or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. These provisions, among other things, establish that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board and establish advance notice requirements for nomination of candidates for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares of common stock. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of our common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages that large accumulations of common stock might provide.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we will also be subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Section 203 prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our voting stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder was approved in advance by our board of directors, results in the stockholder holding more than 85% of our voting stock, subject to certain restrictions, or is approved at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock not held by the stockholder engaging in the transaction.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, which includes, among other things:\n\u2022\nexemption from the auditor attestation requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements;\n\u2022\nexemption from the requirements of holding non-binding stockholder votes on executive compensation arrangements; and\n\u2022\nexemption from any rules requiring mandatory audit firm rotation and auditor discussion and analysis and, unless the SEC otherwise determines, any future audit rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\nWe could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of the Spin-off, which is December 31, 2020, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation) or more, (ii) the date on which we have, during the previous three year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt or (iii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the federal securities laws. We will qualify as a large accelerated filer as of the first day of the first fiscal year after we have (i) more than $700 million in outstanding common equity held by our non-affiliates and (ii) been public for at least 12 months. The value of our outstanding common equity will be measured each year on the last day of our second fiscal quarter.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies are also permitted to elect to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards until companies that are not subject to periodic reporting obligations are required to comply, if such accounting standards apply to non-reporting companies. We have made an irrevocable decision to opt out of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nChanges in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and existing international trade agreements by the current U.S. presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate. If the current U.S. presidential administration materially modifies U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes to federal, state, and local tax laws due to changes in compliance requirements. We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including but not limited to income taxes, indirect taxes\n(such as excise, sales & use, and gross receipts taxes), payroll taxes, and property taxes. Tax laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of existing laws are issued and applied. The activity could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authorities. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 15399, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "HZN"}
