RISK FACTORS\nVarious risks and uncertainties may affect the Company\u2019s business. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or the Company\u2019s other SEC filings may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Wholesale, Save-A-Lot and Retail segments face intense competition, and the Company\u2019s failure to compete successfully may adversely affect its sales, financial condition and operating results.\nThe grocery business is intensely competitive, and the recent and ongoing consolidation within the grocery industry is expected to result in increased competition, including from some competitors that have greater financial, marketing and other resources than the Company. The grocery industry is characterized by relatively small operating margins, and as competition in certain areas intensifies and as the industry continues to consolidate, the Company\u2019s results of operations may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales and reductions in gross margins. Where necessary, in order to compete effectively with competitors, the Company may need to lower its prices on goods for sale and services. The Company may also need to extend additional credit to its Wholesale customers, including through loans, market support or guarantees, and while the Company seeks to obtain security interests and other credit support in connection with the financial accommodations the Company extends, such collateral may not be sufficient to cover its exposure. The nature and extent to which the Company\u2019s competitors implement various pricing, credit support and promotional activities in response to increasing competition and the Company\u2019s response, or failure to respond effectively, to these competitive actions can adversely affect profitability and the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s Wholesale segment is primarily wholesale distribution and services, which competes with traditional grocery wholesalers as well as specialty wholesalers on the basis of price, quality, assortment, schedule and reliability of deliveries and services, service fees and distribution facility locations. The profitability of the Wholesale segment is dependent upon sufficient volume to support the Company\u2019s operating infrastructure, which is dependent on the ability of the Company to attract new customers and retain existing customers, as well as the ability of the Company and its independent retail customers to\ndistinguish themselves from competitors in the grocery channel. The Company\u2019s Wholesale segment also faces competition from retailers that maintain or develop self-distribution systems as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise. The inability to attract new customers, the loss of existing customers to a competing wholesaler or due to closure, vertical integration such as an existing customer converting to self-distribution, or industry consolidation, or the inability of the Company\u2019s customers to compete successfully with other grocery retailers and non-traditional retailers may negatively impact the Company\u2019s sales and gross margin.\nThe Company\u2019s Retail and Save-A-Lot segments face significant competition for customers, managers, employees, store sites and products from traditional grocery retailers, including regional and national chains and independent food store operators, and non-traditional retailers, such as supercenters, membership warehouse clubs, specialty supermarkets, drug stores, discount stores, dollar stores, convenience stores, online retailers and restaurants. Competitors continue to increase their presence in the Company\u2019s markets, including certain non-traditional competitors that have entered the grocery retailing business. The Company\u2019s ability to differentiate itself from its competitors and create an attractive value proposition for its customers is dependent upon a combination of price, quality, customer service, convenience, assortment, in-stock levels, brand perception, store location and conditions, in-store marketing and merchandising and promotional strategies. Any failure to positively differentiate the Company\u2019s stores, as well as the inability to identify and respond to changes in economic conditions and trends in consumer preferences, could decrease the number of customer transactions at the Company\u2019s stores and decrease the amount customers spend when they visit the Company\u2019s stores.\nIn addition, customers are increasingly using tablets, mobile phones, computers and other devices to shop in stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary on their shopping experience, including prices. Multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving. If the Company does not keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments and technology investments by its competitors, the Company\u2019s ability to compete and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully identify and execute on initiatives to increase its sales and profits.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to grow sales and profits depends on many factors, including its ability to attract new customers and licensees throughout its existing network of distribution centers, political, social and economic conditions, and the Company\u2019s ability to successfully identify and execute on growth and profit-enhancing opportunities. The Company continuously evaluates the changing business environments in which it operates and seeks out opportunities to improve performance, customer service and growth through selected initiatives. The Company\u2019s ability to execute on these initiatives is dependent, in part, upon its ability to continue to provide a high level of customer service, offer competitive products at low prices, maintain high levels of productivity, become a more cost-efficient organization and offer services that provide value. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to identify the appropriate course of action, including which initiatives will be the most effective in improving the competitive position or profitability of the Company, or that the Company will be able to respond appropriately to competitors\u2019 initiatives. If the Company is unable to execute on its initiatives, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company may engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of divested businesses from, the Company\u2019s current operations; therefore, the Company may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures.\nThe Company may engage in strategic acquisitions. The Company\u2019s due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target\u2019s previous activities. The Company may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation and other liabilities. The Company also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with its operations, applying its internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments. Additionally, the Company may not realize the degree or timing of benefits it anticipates when it first enters into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s competitive position, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. Furthermore, the Company may make strategic divestitures from time to time. Any divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements, following the transaction. Under these arrangements, non-performance by those divested businesses could result in obligations imposed on the Company and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s competitive position, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. The success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the transactions, the timing of consummation of these transactions and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things.\nThe results and impact of the Company\u2019s announcement that it is exploring a separation of its Save-A-Lot segment and that it has begun preparations to allow for a possible spin-off of Save-A-Lot into a stand-alone, publicly traded company are uncertain and cannot be determined.\nOn July 28, 2015, the Company announced that it is exploring a separation of its Save-A-Lot segment, and that as part of that process it has begun preparations to allow for a possible spin-off of Save-A-Lot into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, including engaging financial and legal advisors. On January 7, 2016, Save-A-Lot, Inc. filed a Form 10 with the SEC as part of the ongoing exploration of a potential separation from the Company. No specific timetable for a separation has been set and there can be no assurance that a separation will be completed or that any other change in the Company\u2019s overall structure or business model will occur. Any transaction or other change in the Company\u2019s overall structure or business model that is ultimately completed may not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance shareholder value. The Company has, and expects to continue to, incur expenses associated with preparing for a possible spin-off, and the process of considering, preparing for and implementing such a course of action may distract the Company\u2019s management team from their day-to-day responsibilities and make it more difficult to retain employees, and may otherwise be disruptive to the Company\u2019s business operations. Any of these risks or uncertainties could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s Wholesale and Save-A-Lot licensee distribution business models present a number of risks.\nThe Company\u2019s success relies in part on the financial success and cooperation of its independent retail customers and Save-A-Lot licensees. These independent retail customers and licensees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their stores. The revenues the Company realizes from these independent retail customers and licensees are largely dependent on their ability to maintain and grow their sales. They may not experience sales growth or achieve an acceptable level of sales or profitability, and the Company\u2019s revenues and gross margins could be negatively affected as a result. If sales trends or profitability worsen for independent retail customers or licensees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, store closures or delayed or reduced payments to the Company and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to grow its Wholesale or Save-A-Lot licensee business. Additionally, if licensees do not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with the Company\u2019s required standards, the Save-A-Lot brand\u2019s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nThe Company may not be able to grow or maintain its levels of identical store sales.\nThe Company has experienced both positive and negative identical store sales in recent periods. If the Company\u2019s identical store sales decline or fail to meet market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock could decline. A variety of factors affect identical store sales and profitability, including consumer tastes, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, deflation and weather conditions, and many of these factors are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict in advance. These factors may cause the Company\u2019s identical store sales results to be materially lower than recent periods, which could harm the Company\u2019s results of operations and result in a decline in the price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to maintain or increase its operating margins could adversely affect its results of operations and the price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nThe Company may not be able to maintain or increase its operating margins. If the Company is not able to continue to capture scale efficiencies, improve its systems and discipline and enhance its merchandise offerings, the Company may not be able to achieve its goals with respect to operating margins. In addition, if the Company does not continuously refine and improve its various ordering, tracking and allocation systems, the Company may not be able to increase sales and reduce inventory shrinkage. As a result, the Company\u2019s operating margins may stagnate or decline, which could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nThe Company has substantial indebtedness that could increase the Company\u2019s borrowing costs and decrease the Company\u2019s financial and operational flexibility.\nThe Company has, and expects to continue to have, a substantial amount of debt. The Company\u2019s indebtedness may increase the Company\u2019s borrowing costs and decrease the Company\u2019s business flexibility, making it more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions. For example, substantial levels of debt could:\n\u2022\nrequire the Company to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, growth opportunities, capital expenditures, acquisitions and for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain, or increase the cost at which the Company is able to obtain, amendments to its existing indebtedness or financing in order to refinance existing indebtedness and fund working capital, store growth opportunities, capital expenditures, acquisitions and for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to adjust to changing business and market conditions and to respond to market opportunities, placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors that have less debt.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s debt portfolio has a variable interest rate component. Volatility in interest rates causes volatility in interest expense, potentially resulting in an adverse impact to earnings. Additionally, pursuant to the Company\u2019s debt agreements, the Company has created a security interest in substantially all of its assets to secure certain debt instruments. The Company has also agreed to certain limitations on its ability to acquire or dispose of assets and is required to use the proceeds of such dispositions to pay down its debt, subject to certain exceptions. There are also various restrictive covenants and cross-default covenants in the Company\u2019s debt instruments that could limit the Company\u2019s operating and financial flexibility.\nIf the Company fails to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and the Company may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due. A default under the Company\u2019s debt instruments may also significantly affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional or alternative financing.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to comply with the covenants or to refinance the Company\u2019s obligations with respect to the Company\u2019s indebtedness will depend on the Company\u2019s operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. In particular, the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets may be adversely impacted by global economic conditions. Tightening of credit, low liquidity or volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit and higher costs of borrowing, making it more difficult for the Company to obtain or amend debt financing on favorable terms. These conditions and factors may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s debt ratings, which may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to access one or more financial markets.\nAny of these outcomes may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased healthcare, pension and other costs under the Company\u2019s and multiemployer benefit plans, or failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company provides health benefits to many of its employees and the costs of such benefits continue to increase annually. The amount of any increase or decrease in the cost of Company-sponsored health plans will depend on a number of different factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which has resulted in changes to the U.S. healthcare system and imposes mandatory types of coverage and reporting and other requirements on Company-sponsored health plans. If the Company is unable to control healthcare benefits and pension costs, the Company may experience increased operating costs, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension, defined contribution pension, and other postretirement benefit plans for substantially all employees not participating in multiemployer health and pension plans. The Company\u2019s costs to provide these benefits generally continue to increase annually. Additionally, the projected benefit obligations of the Company-sponsored plans exceed the fair value of those plans\u2019 assets. The Company uses actuarial valuations to determine the Company\u2019s benefit obligations for certain benefit plans, which require the use of significant estimates, including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs. Changes to these significant estimates could increase the cost of these plans, which could also have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company participates in various multiemployer health and pension plans for a majority of its union-affiliated employees, and the Company is required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. The costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years. The amount of any increase or decrease in the Company\u2019s required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if the Company chooses to exit a market. Withdrawal liabilities could be material, and potential exposure to withdrawal liabilities may influence business decisions and could cause the Company to forgo business opportunities. Increases in the costs of benefits under these plans, coupled with both performance below the plans\u2019 assumed rates of return in the equity and fixed income markets in past years\nand withdrawals of other companies from these plans, have caused most multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates to be underfunded. Many of these plans have required rehabilitation plans or funding improvement plans, and the Company can give no assurances of the extent to which a rehabilitation plan or a funding improvement plan will improve the funded status of the plan. The Company expects that the unfunded liabilities of these plans will result in increased future payments by the Company and the other participating employers over the next few years. Underfunded multiemployer pension plans may, in certain situations, impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions. The Company\u2019s risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. A significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe financial condition of these pension plans may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s debt ratings, which may increase the cost of borrowing, adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to access one or more financial markets or result in a default under the Company\u2019s debt instruments.\nAs of February 27, 2016, the Company is a party to 55 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 16,000 of its employees, of which 24 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 8,400 employees are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2017. In addition, during fiscal 2016, nine collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 1,600 employees were renegotiated. In fiscal 2016, three collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 110 employees expired without their terms being renegotiated. Also four collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 700 employees expired prior to fiscal 2016 without terms being negotiated. Negotiations are expected to continue with the bargaining units representing the employees subject to those agreements. In future negotiations with labor unions, the Company expects that, among other issues, rising healthcare, pension and employee benefit and wage costs and operational flexibility will be important topics for negotiation. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to negotiate the terms of expiring or expired agreements in a manner acceptable to the Company. Therefore, potential increases in operating costs or work disruptions from labor disputes could disrupt the Company\u2019s businesses and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Certain of the Company\u2019s operations have employees who are non-union, and while the Company believes its employee relations are strong, there can be no assurance that these operations will not experience pressure from labor unions or become the target of campaigns to unionize.\nThe Company\u2019s relationships with NAI, Albertson\u2019s LLC and Haggen are winding down, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn connection with the sale of NAI in March 2013, the Company entered into the TSA with each of NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC to support the divested NAI banners and the continuing operations of Albertson\u2019s LLC. The Company continues to perform services under the TSA with each of NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC, and the Company is also providing services as needed to transition and wind down these TSA. The Company estimates that the complete transition and wind down of the TSA could take approximately two to three more years. This estimate is based on the transition completed to date and information currently known to the Company and could change.\nThe transition and wind down of the TSA could be time consuming and resource intensive for the Company. The Company is working with NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC to coordinate the requirements to fully transition and wind down the TSA. While the transition and wind down has proceeded smoothly to date, this work is on-going and could lead to disputes with NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC, including related to what services the Company must perform to transition and wind down these TSA, the manner or timeline in which these transition and wind down services are performed and the cost to perform these services, which could cause disruptions and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe amount of revenue the Company receives under the TSA with each of NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC is based on the number of NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC stores and distribution centers receiving services under the TSA. Pursuant to the terms of the TSA, NAI and Albertson\u2019s have notified the Company, and will continue to notify the Company during the transition and wind down of the TSA, that NAI and Albertson's LLC have decided to not receive further services at stores or distribution centers. As stores and distributions centers are removed from the TSA, the variable fee the Company receives under the TSA is reduced beginning shortly after the Company receives notice of such removal and the store or distribution center is no longer receiving services. The fixed portion of the TSA fee for stores and distribution centers also resets each September 22 (beginning September 22, 2015) based on the number of stores and distribution centers receiving services as of such date.\nThe Company entered into the Haggen TSA in December 2014 to provide services to 164 stores and also entered into a supply agreement with Haggen to supply certain of the stores in two states. In September 2015, Haggen filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Through the bankruptcy process, Haggen has now closed, sold\nor agreed to sell all 164 stores. While the Company continues to provide services under the Haggen TSA, it expects that all such services will cease under the Haggen TSA in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Certain of the stores under the Haggen TSA will or have been sold to Albertson's LLC and will or have been added to the TSA with Albertson's LLC. The Company has filed for approximately $2 of administrative 503(b)(9) priority claims and for approximately $8 of other claims with the bankruptcy court. The Company could also be exposed to claims from third parties from which the Company sourced products, services, licenses and similar benefits on behalf of Haggen. Failure to recover the amounts payable by Haggen or any adverse results from any such claims from third parties could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe impact of the wind down of the TSA with NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC and the Haggen TSA on the Company\u2019s results of operations depends on the amount and timing of lost revenue compared to the Company\u2019s ability to identify and execute on cost reductions (including costs not directly related to providing TSA services), new services relationships, growth strategies and additional investments in the business that accelerate revenue growth. The Company expects that the decline in TSA revenue from stores and distribution centers no longer receiving services under the TSA as part of the transition and wind down of the TSA will happen earlier than the decline in TSA services the Company is required to perform, which the Company expects will prevent it from being able to take out certain costs until some period of time after the TSA revenue declines. This timing difference creates challenges for the Company in managing its costs and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations in any given period.\nThe Company continues to develop and engage in cost reduction initiatives and other strategies to generate services revenue streams. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully implement and execute on these initiatives and strategies or that the Company will otherwise be able to fully address the impact of the termination of these TSAs and failure to do so could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue to perform services under the TSAs at the applicable service level, and to provide transition and wind down services for the TSA, will depend partly on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Retaining such personnel may be more difficult in connection with the transition and wind down of the TSA. A shortage of qualified employees who devote time to services under the TSAs could increase the Company\u2019s costs and decrease the Company\u2019s ability to effectively serve these customers. The Company could face claims for disruptions or other impacts to the businesses of NAI, Albertson\u2019s LLC or Haggen.\nThe Company is also a party to an Operating and Supply Agreement with NAI under which the Company operates a distribution center owned by NAI. The Company provides wholesale distribution of products to certain NAI banners and to certain of the Company\u2019s independent retail customers from this distribution center. This agreement may be terminated by either party on 24 months\u2019 notice. If the Company were not able to supply its independent retail customers from this distribution center, it would need to identify an alternative distribution center to service those customers. Identifying, and potentially building, a replacement distribution center could be time consuming and resource intensive for the Company and a delay or failure to do so could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company experienced information technology intrusions in fiscal 2015 that could adversely impact its business and future operating results.\nIn fiscal 2015, the Company experienced separate criminal intrusions into the portion of its computer network that processes payment card transactions for some of its owned and franchised retail food stores, including some of the associated stand-alone liquor stores. These intrusions may have resulted in the theft of account numbers, and in some cases also the expiration date, other numerical information and/or the cardholder\u2019s name, from payment cards used at some point of sale systems at some of the Company\u2019s owned and franchised stores.\nWhile the costs that the Company has incurred to date in connection with the intrusions primarily include professional advisory and legal costs relating to its continuing investigation of the intrusions, the Company expects to incur additional costs and expenses related to the intrusions in the future. The Company may also be adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card brands, stockholders and others and by costly inquiries or enforcement actions on the part of regulatory authorities.\nThe Company has also expended significant time and resources on enhanced protective technology. The Company continues to take actions to implement further security enhancements and the Company is committed to continuing to improve its information security safeguards to protect its stores against intrusions. The time and resources devoted to enhancing the Company\u2019s information security can be disruptive to the day-to-day operations of the Company\u2019s businesses, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nSome stores owned and operated by Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI experienced related criminal intrusions. The Company provides information technology services to these Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI stores pursuant to the TSA, and the Company has been working together with Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI to respond to the intrusion into their stores. While the Company believes that any losses incurred by Albertson\u2019s LLC or NAI as a result of the intrusion affecting their stores would not be the Company\u2019s responsibility, the Company could face claims by Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI related to the intrusions, or other third parties seeking to hold the Company responsible for the intrusions into the stores of Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI. The Company also cannot be certain whether the intrusions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s relationships with Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI.\nThe Company is currently subject to private litigation and claims relating to the intrusions, and an inquiry from a multistate group of Attorneys General. In the future the Company may be subject to additional litigation and claims and to governmental investigations or proceedings relating to one or both of the intrusions. The Company\u2019s financial liability arising from such litigation, claims, investigations or proceedings will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe results of the payment card brands\u2019 investigations of the intrusions;\n\u2022\nwhether, at the time of the intrusions, the portion of its network that handles payment card data was in compliance with applicable payment card industry standards;\n\u2022\nwhether, and if so to what extent, any fraud losses or other expenses experienced by cardholders, card issuers and/or the payment card brands on or with respect to the payment card accounts affected by the intrusions can be properly attributed to these intrusions and whether, and if so to what extent, those expenses would be the Company\u2019s legal responsibility;\n\u2022\nthe nature and extent of any losses to Albertson\u2019s LLC or NAI from the intrusions and any claims asserted against the Company for such losses; and\n\u2022\nthe adequacy of the Company\u2019s insurance.\nDisruptions to the Company\u2019s or third-party information technology systems, including future cyber-attacks and security breaches, and the costs of maintaining secure and effective information technology systems could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe efficient operation of the Company\u2019s businesses is highly dependent on computer hardware and software systems, including customized information technology systems. Information systems are vulnerable to disruptions and security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists. The Company relies on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information stored on the Company\u2019s information systems, and continues to invest in maintaining and upgrading the systems and applications to control risk. The Company also relies on third-party systems and software that are critical to the operation of its business, including accepting credit, debit, EBT and gift cards. In response to the information technology intrusions the Company experienced in fiscal 2015, the Company has taken and is continuing to take actions to strengthen the security of its information technology systems. Nevertheless, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches in the future or the Company may not be able to timely implement these measures and technology. There can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer another intrusion or that a third-party that is relied on by the Company will not suffer an intrusion, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to confidential or personal information, or that any such incident will be discovered promptly. The techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, and the Company or its third-party provider may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. The failure to promptly detect, determine the extent of and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or failure of these systems or software to perform as anticipated for any reason, including a major disaster, technical malfunction or business interruption, and any inability to respond to, or recover from, such an event, or any inability to timely implement new security measures or technology, could disrupt the Company\u2019s business, impact the Company\u2019s customers and could result in decreased performance, increased overhead costs and increased risk for liability, causing the Company\u2019s business and results of operations to suffer.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s businesses involve the receipt, storage and transmission of sensitive data, including personal information about the Company\u2019s customers and employees and proprietary business information of the Company and its customers and vendors. The Company may also share information with vendors that assist the Company in conducting its business, as required by law, with the permission of the individual or as permitted under the Company\u2019s privacy policy. The sharing of information continues to increase as customers are increasingly using tablets, mobile phones, computers and other devices to shop in stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary on their shopping experience, including prices. Multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving. If the Company\u2019s or a vendor\u2019s customer-facing technology systems do not reliably function as designed, the Company may experience a loss of customer confidence or data security breaches or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, which, if significant, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and results of operations. As a merchant that accepts debit and credit cards for payment, the Company is subject to the Payment Card\nIndustry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d), issued by the PCI Council. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to the Company\u2019s security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. By accepting debit cards for payment, the Company is also subject to compliance with American National Standards Institute data encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines. The payment card industry set October 1, 2015 as the date on which it began to shift liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept Europay, MasterCard, and Visa (EMV) transactions. The Company expects to implement the EMV technology in calendar year 2016. As a result, before the implementation of the EMV technology, the Company may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees. As a result of the intrusions, the Company engaged a new third-party security firm to provide the Company a report on compliance with PCI DSS. This transition of security firms delayed the Company\u2019s receipt of its report on PCI DSS compliance. On June 30, 2015, the Company received its merchant report on compliance and on September 30, 2015, the Company received its service provider report on compliance with respect to PCI DSS version 3.1.\nDespite any certifications and the utilization of other information security measures, the Company cannot be certain that all of its information technology (\"IT\") systems or the IT systems of its vendors operate properly or will be able to prevent, contain or detect any future cyber-attacks or security breaches from known malware, malware that may be developed in the future or otherwise. Cyber-attacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect, and therefore, the Company may be unable to anticipate these attacks or implement adequate preventive measures. Additionally, unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to the Company\u2019s or a vendor\u2019s systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deception involving the Company\u2019s employees or vendors. To the extent that any attack or breach results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, the Company may be adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card brands, stockholders and others and by costly inquiries or enforcement actions on the part of regulatory authorities. The Company\u2019s operations could also be significantly disrupted by these claims, as well as by the need to spend significant time and resources/funds to upgrade, fix or replace its systems. The Company could also lose credibility with its customers and suffer damage to its reputation and future sales, including through negative publicity and social media. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards, including PCI DSS version 3.1, and developing, maintaining and upgrading technology systems to address future advances in technology, could be significant and the Company could experience problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems.\nWorsening economic conditions could adversely impact consumer spending, increase costs of doing business or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe vast majority of the Company\u2019s operations and customers are located in the United States, making its results highly dependent on U.S. consumer confidence and spending habits. In recent economic cycles, the U.S. economy has experienced economic recession, higher unemployment rates, higher energy costs, higher insurance and healthcare costs, a decline in the housing market, and greater restrictions on the availability of credit, all of which contributed to reduced consumer confidence and increased price competition.\nWhile the U.S. economy and consumer confidence have improved recently, the sustainability of these improvements remains uncertain. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify and respond to changes and trends in consumer spending and preferences and/or maintain the competitive position of its operations. Additionally, these economic factors, along with higher interest rates, costs of labor and tax rates, and other changes in tax, healthcare and other laws and regulations, can increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nChanges in commodity prices, including due to inflation or deflation, and availability of commodities may affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nMany products the Company sells include ingredients such as wheat, corn, oils, milk, eggs, sugar, cocoa and other commodities. In addition, the Company purchases and uses significant quantities of packaging materials to package its products and energy for its distribution centers, stores and offices. Prices for these raw materials, other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict. These conditions include global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, political conditions, severe weather, the potential longer-term consequences of climate change on agricultural productivity, crop disease or pests, water risk, health pandemics, consumer or industrial demand, and changes in governmental trade, alternative energy and agricultural programs.\nWe believe the Company\u2019s Save-A-Lot segment is impacted to a greater degree by inflation and deflation than traditional grocery formats due to product mix, its edited assortment of products and product sourcing on private-label products.\nContinued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies the Company purchases could increase or decrease the costs of the Company\u2019s products, and its sales and profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of the Company\u2019s products to cover increased input costs may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could cause the Company to lower its prices and thereby affect its revenues or gross margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit the Company\u2019s ability to grow its net revenues. If the Company\u2019s mitigation activities are not effective, if the Company is unable to increase prices to cover increased costs or must reduce its prices, or if the Company is limited by supply constraints, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to laws and governmental regulations that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices. These laws require the Company to comply with numerous provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food safety, marketing of natural or organically produced food, facilities, environmental, equal employment opportunity, public accessibility, employee benefits, wages and hours worked and licensing for the sale of food, drugs and alcoholic beverages, among others. The Company is also required to meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The Company\u2019s inability to timely obtain permits, comply with government regulations or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance with governmental regulations may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business operations and prospects for future growth and its ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs. In addition, changes in federal or state minimum wage and overtime laws could cause the Company to incur additional wage costs, which could adversely affect the Company's operating margins.\nThe Company cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can the Company determine the effect that additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on the Company\u2019s future business. They may, however, impose additional requirements or restrictions on the products the Company sells, require that the Company recall or discontinue sale of certain products, make substantial changes to the Company\u2019s facilities or operations, or otherwise result in changes to the manner in which the Company operates its businesses. Any or all of such requirements may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s supplier base includes domestic and foreign suppliers, and the Company has a small number of licensed stores in foreign countries. Accordingly, political or financial instability in these foreign countries, changes in U.S. and foreign relationships, laws and regulations affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, or changes in the enforcement of those laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company is required to comply with laws and regulations governing ethical, anti-bribery and similar business practices. In our foreign operations, the Company is subject to the risk that one or more of its employees, contractors or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to the Company, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, or will engage in business practices that are prohibited by the Company\u2019s policies or circumvent its compliance programs. Any of these violations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. The Company may choose to pursue further expansion into international markets. If the Company seeks and attains a larger international footprint, it would be required to comply with additional foreign laws and regulations. Any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in civil and/or criminal sanctions and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Further, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an effect on our future costs or on future cash flows from our foreign operations, and could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company may face significant costs for compliance with existing or changing environmental, health, food safety and safety requirements and for potential environmental obligations relating to current or discontinued operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, the disposal of food by-products, the handling, treatment and disposal of wastes and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Failure to comply with these requirements could have serious consequences for the Company, including criminal, as well as civil and administrative penalties, claims for property damage, personal injury and damage to natural resources and negative publicity. Compliance with existing or changing environmental requirements, including more stringent limitations imposed or expected to be imposed in recently renewed or soon-to-be renewed environmental permits, may require capital expenditures.\nOperations at many of the Company\u2019s facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater, storm-water and agricultural and food processing wastes, the use and maintenance of refrigeration systems, including ammonia-based chillers, noise, odor and dust management, the operation of mechanized processing equipment, and other operations that potentially could affect the environment, health and safety. Some of the Company\u2019s facilities have been operating for many years, and were built before current environmental standards were imposed, and/or in areas that recently have become subject to residential and commercial development pressures. Failure to comply with current and future environmental, health and safety standards could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, and the Company has been subject to such sanctions from time to time. New environmental, health and safety requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, or obligations related to the investigation or clean-up of contaminated sites, may materially affect the Company\u2019s business or operations in the future.\nReal or perceived food quality and food or drug safety issues and related unfavorable publicity could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results and reputation.\nThere is increasing governmental scrutiny, regulations and public awareness regarding food quality and food and drug safety. The Company may be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the Company\u2019s food and drug products. Any events that give rise to actual or potential food contamination, drug contamination or food-borne illness or injury, or events that give rise to claims that the Company\u2019s products are not of the quality or composition claimed to be, may result in product liability claims from individuals, consumers and governmental agencies, penalties and enforcement actions from government agencies, a loss of consumer confidence and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether valid or not, may discourage consumers from buying the Company\u2019s products or cause production and delivery disruptions, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. It may be necessary for the Company to recall unsafe, contaminated or defective products. Recall costs and product liability claims can be material. While the Company generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from its suppliers, it might not be able to recover these significant costs from its suppliers.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses may become subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to the risk of legal proceedings by employees, unions, consumers, customers, suppliers, stockholders, debt holders, governmental agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation or proceeding. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease consumer confidence in the Company\u2019s businesses, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether the Company is ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. See also \u201cItem 3 Legal Proceedings\u201d below.\nEfforts to reduce pharmacy reimbursement levels and alter health care financing practices may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, government entities and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact the Company\u2019s profitability. In particular, increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals (which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs) has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to the Company\u2019s pharmacies for generic drugs, causing a reduction in the Company\u2019s generic profit rate. Additionally, there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry, and it is possible that this and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceuticals and diminish the Company\u2019s ability to negotiate reduced acquisition costs. Any inability to offset increased costs or to modify the Company\u2019s activities to lessen the impact could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn addition, during the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audits at both the federal and state levels. Efforts to control health care costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuing at the federal and state government levels. Changing political, economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices. A change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward programs offering lower reimbursement rates could negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act made several significant changes to Medicaid rebates and to reimbursement. One of these changes was to revise the definition of the Average Manufacturer Price, a pricing element common to most payment formulas,\nand the reimbursement formula for multi-source (i.e., generic) drugs. This change will affect the Company\u2019s reimbursement. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of the Company\u2019s health plan clients, including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees. These Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act changes may not affect the Company\u2019s business directly, but they could indirectly impact the Company\u2019s services and/or business practices.\nThe Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights, which could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company relies on a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright and domain name law and internal procedures and nondisclosure agreements to protect its intellectual property. The Company believes its trademarks, private label products and domain names are valuable assets. However, the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to distinguish the Company\u2019s products and services from those of its competitors and to provide the Company with a competitive advantage. From time to time, third parties may use names, logos and slogans similar to the Company\u2019s, may apply to register trademarks or domain names similar to the Company\u2019s, and may infringe or otherwise violate the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights. The Company\u2019s intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted against such third parties or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Asserting or defending the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights could be time consuming and costly and could distract management\u2019s attention and resources. If the Company is unable to prevent its competitors from using names, logos, slogans and domain names similar to the Company\u2019s, consumer confusion could result, the perception of the Company\u2019s brands and products could be negatively affected, and the Company\u2019s sales and profitability could suffer as a result. In addition, if the Company\u2019s independent retail customers or Save-A-Lot licensees receive negative publicity or fail to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the Company\u2019s trademarks, the Company\u2019s rights to, and the value of, its trademarks could potentially be harmed. Failure to protect the Company\u2019s proprietary information could also have an adverse effect on its business.\nThe Company may also be subject to claims that its activities or the products it sells infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management\u2019s attention and resources, even if the claims are without merit. Such claims may also require the Company to enter into costly settlement or license agreements (which could, for example, prevent the Company from using its trademarks in certain geographies or in connection with certain products and services), pay costly damage awards, and face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or providing the affected products and services, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nSevere weather and natural disasters may harm the Company\u2019s business.\nSevere weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, extended winter storms or tornadoes, as well as other natural disasters, in areas in which the Company or its independent retail customers or licensees have stores, offices or distribution facilities or from which the Company obtains products may cause physical damage to the Company\u2019s properties, closure of one or more of the Company\u2019s or its independent retail customers\u2019 or licensees\u2019 stores, offices or distribution facilities, lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary disruption in the supply of products, disruption in the transport of goods, delays in the delivery of goods to distribution centers or stores, a reduction in customer volume and a reduction in the availability of products in the Company\u2019s or its independent retail customers\u2019 or licensees\u2019 stores. In addition, adverse climate conditions and adverse weather patterns, such as drought or flood, that impact growing conditions and the quantity and quality of crops yielded by food producers may adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within the grocery supply chain. Any of these factors may disrupt the Company\u2019s businesses and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruption to the supply chain and distribution network could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s sales and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s sales and operating results could be adversely impacted if the Company is not able to provide goods to the Company\u2019s stores and its customers\u2019 and licensees\u2019 stores in a timely and cost-effective manner, to maintain continued supply, pricing or access to new products or to identify alternative sources of merchandise without delay and at similar cost and quality levels. Additionally, perishable products make up an increasingly significant portion of our sales, and we rely on various suppliers to provide and deliver our perishable product inventory on a continuous basis.\nFactors that may disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply chain and distribution network include weather, product recalls, crop conditions, regulatory actions, disruptions in technology, political or financial instability for\nsuppliers, transportation interruptions, labor supply or stoppages or vendor defaults or disputes, as well as other risk factors mentioned, any of which could also have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s sales and operating results. Disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could also negatively affect the Company\u2019s business.\nChanges in the military commissary system or decreases in governmental funding could negatively impact the sales and operating performance of the Company\u2019s military business.\nThe Company\u2019s Wholesale segment sells and distributes grocery products to military commissaries and exchanges in the United States. The Company\u2019s military business faces competition from large national and regional food distributors as well as smaller food distributors. Due to the narrow operating margins in the military food distribution industry, it is of critical importance for distributors to achieve economies of scale. Any material changes in the commissary system, the level of governmental funding to the Defense Commissary Agency (\u201cDeCA\u201d), military staffing levels, or the locations of bases may have a corresponding impact on the sales and operating performance of the Company\u2019s military business. Mandated reductions in government expenditures, including those imposed as a result of sequestration, may impact the level of funding to the DeCA and could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance and self-insurance programs may not be adequate to cover future claims.\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liabilities for workers\u2019 compensation, automobile and general liability, director and officer liability, property risk, cyber and privacy risks and employee healthcare benefits. The Company estimates the liabilities associated with the risks retained by the Company, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions, which, by their nature, are subject to a degree of variability. Any actuarial projection of losses concerning workers\u2019 compensation and general and automobile liability is subject to a degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, discount rates, rising health care costs, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and actual claim settlement patterns. For example, the Company believes that its insurance coverage will mitigate the financial impact of the criminal intrusions to the Company\u2019s information technology systems that it experienced in fiscal 2015; however, the Company cannot be certain that its coverage will fully mitigate the financial impact of the intrusions or that such coverage will not be disputed.\nSome of the many sources of uncertainty in the Company\u2019s reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels, medical fee schedules, medical utilization guidelines, vocation rehabilitation and apportionment. If the number or severity of claims for which the Company is self-insured increases, or the Company is required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than the Company\u2019s original assessments, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nVolatility in fuel and energy costs and risk associated with the Company\u2019s compressed natural gas program could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are dependent on the availability of a significant amount of energy and fuel to store and transport products. Energy and fuel costs are influenced by supply as well as international, political and economic circumstances and have experienced volatility over time. To reduce the impact of volatile fuel and energy costs, the Company has entered into contracts to purchase fuel, electricity and natural gas at fixed prices to satisfy a portion of its expected needs. Additionally, the Company has invested in approximately 60 semitrailer trucks powered by compressed natural gas. In the recent past, the price of natural gas has been volatile, and this volatility may continue. Additionally, having compressed natural gas equipment and a fueling station entails inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures and natural disasters, which could result in flows of natural gas, fires, explosions and other damages, and could subject the Company to additional regulation. Volatility in fuel and energy costs that exceeds offsetting contractual arrangements, or failure to recognize the anticipated benefits from the compressed natural gas program, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nImpairment charges for long-lived assets or goodwill may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company monitors the recoverability of its long-lived assets such as buildings and equipment and evaluates their carrying value for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Events that may trigger such an evaluation include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or the Company\u2019s plans for store closures. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the group of assets being tested.\nThe Company annually reviews goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred. Additionally, interim reviews are performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, the Company is required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made.\nThe testing of goodwill for impairment requires the Company to make significant estimates about its weighted average cost of capital, future revenue, profitability, cash flows, fair value of assets and liabilities, as well as other assumptions. These estimates may be affected by significant variability, including potential changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations and market strategies, changes in competition or changes in the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of the Company\u2019s future performance, may affect the fair value of goodwill, which may result in an impairment charge.\nThe Company cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of long-lived assets or goodwill become impaired, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors. These factors, some of which may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, include the perceived prospects and actual operating results of the Company\u2019s business; changes in estimates of the Company\u2019s operating results by analysts, investors or the Company; trading activity by our large stockholders; the Company\u2019s actual operating results relative to such estimates or expectations; actions or announcements by the Company or its competitors; litigation and judicial decisions; legislative or regulatory actions; and changes in general economic or market conditions. In addition, the stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations could reduce the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock for reasons unrelated to the Company\u2019s operating performance.", "PERMNO": 44951, "SIC": 5141, "TIC": "SVU"}
