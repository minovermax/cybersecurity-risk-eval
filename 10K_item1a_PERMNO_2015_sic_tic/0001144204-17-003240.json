{"cik": "1093207", "company": "CROSSROADS SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-01-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to purchase any of our securities. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and our prospects could be harmed. In that event, the price of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nLitigation, Regulation and Business Risks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe face current and potential adverse determinations in litigation stemming from our efforts to protect and enforce our patents and intellectual property rights and make other claims, which could broadly impact our intellectual property rights and our ability to conduct our business as currently operated, distract our management and cause substantial expenses and declines in our revenue and stock price.\nEfforts to protect our intellectual property rights and to defend claims against us can increase our costs and will not always succeed; any failures could adversely affect revenues and profitability.\nIntellectual property rights are crucial to our technology licensing programs. We endeavor to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and in selected international markets. Our IP licensing revenue for the year ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively. If we experience a decline in revenue from our licensees, as a result of economic conditions, customers\u2019 business performance, or otherwise, we could be materially and adversely affected. We may be unable to retain all of our intellectual property protection. Even if protection is obtained, competitors or others in the chain of commerce may raise legal challenges to our rights or illegally infringe on our rights, including through means that may be difficult to prevent or detect. For example, much of our proprietary technology resides in software that frequently is not publicly available and has prevented and may continue to prevent us from realizing the full value of our intellectual property. In addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change, and the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions, competitors may be issued patents from applications that were unknown to us prior to issuance. These patents could reduce the value of our intellectual property, to the extent they cover technologies on which we have unknowingly relied, require that we seek to obtain licenses or cease using the technology, no matter how valuable to our business. We cannot assure we would be able to obtain such a license on acceptable terms. The extent to which we succeed or fail in our efforts to protect our intellectual property will affect our costs, sales and other results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, and we will be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States. Further, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even issued patents may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and, as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of our own intellectual property and that of others. Such litigation could be costly and divert management resources, either of which could harm our business. We have also identified a number of companies that we believe may infringe our intellectual property, and there are likely others in our industry that infringe our intellectual property that we have not yet identified. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce and defend their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to successfully identify third-party infringement or prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property, nor can we ensure that we will not be accused of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others.\nAdverse outcomes in legal proceedings could subject us to substantial damages and adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nWe are involved in major lawsuits concerning intellectual property and other matters, which are time-consuming and the outcomes of which may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized or limit our ability to engage in our business activities. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to great uncertainty, and although we intend to vigorously pursue our claims, there are no guarantees that we can protect our intellectual property rights in our current litigation or related proceedings, settle any of the current litigation actions, prevail in any of the current litigation actions or related proceedings or prevent the unauthorized use of our technology now and in the future. Further, any favorable result we receive at the trial level or at the U.S. Patent Office may be appealed by the other party. Such appeals are expensive and time consuming, resulting in increased costs and, at a minimum, delay in receiving revenue. A successful appeal could overturn entirely any positive result for the company from a trial court or the U.S. Patent Office. Although we diligently pursue enforcement litigation, we cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions made by juries, trial courts, the U.S. Patent Office or an appellate court.\nAdditionally, unintended consequences of our litigation may adversely affect our business, including, without limitation, that we may have to devote significant time and financial resources to pursuing the litigation, that we have become subject to counterclaims or lawsuits and may become subject to additional counterclaims and lawsuits, that the parties we pursue claims against have filed actions, and may file additional actions, with the government (including inter partes review proceedings) to attempt to invalidate or render our patents unenforceable, and that the expenses of pursuing the litigation and related proceedings could increase based upon these counterclaims, lawsuits, inter partes review proceedings or new developments in the pending proceedings. In addition, if we do not prevail in our patent litigation or in the inter partes review proceedings, the consequences could include the circumvention or invalidation of our patents, which could have a material adverse effect on our ongoing licensing program, our ability to enforce our existing licenses, and the ability to recover damages based on infringement of our patents. Additionally, an adverse result in a counterclaim or lawsuit against us, or an inter partes review proceeding, could result in our not having the intellectual property rights necessary to practice our business as currently operated. These and other factors not currently known to or deemed material by management, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, and results of operations.\nWe have transferred ownership of the non-\u2018972 patents to a limited partnership with an affiliate of Fortress that we do not fully control, and efforts by this limited partnership to generate revenues from the transferred patents and patent applications may not be successful.\nAs described above, in connection with a July 2013 secured loan transaction with Fortress, we transferred substantially all of our non-\u2018972 patents to a limited partnership of which an affiliate of Fortress is the general partner. Fortress generally has the power to manage, control and conduct the business and affairs of the partnership. While the limited partnership agreement gives us the right to consent to certain actions, as a limited partner we do not control the partnership and have a limited ability to direct any licensing and monetization activities without Fortress\u2019s consent.\nThis partnership poses risks not otherwise present when we alone seek to license our technology. For example: Fortress may or may not take actions that we believe to be in our best interest; we may incur liabilities as a result of actions taken, or not taken, by the partnership; we may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the partnership, including litigation and licensing matters, as well management of the partnership relationship; any strategy or other disputes between us and Fortress may result in delays, expenses or operational impasses; and while we have retained a fully paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the assigned patents, these patents are now owned by a third party not under our control, and will remain as such unless and until we are able to buy out Fortress\u2019s interest in the partnership.\nThis partnership may attempt to pursue patent licensing and enforcement activity that may generate revenues for us. However, we cannot predict the success of those efforts or when revenues, if any, are generated. Any efforts to generate such revenues may require us to expend significant monetary resources. Until the Company has exercised its option to repurchase Fortress\u2019s interest in the partnership, any revenues generated from a licensing program will be subject to the revenue sharing agreement defined in the limited partnership agreement. These limitations on our ability to monetize our non-\u2018972 patent family could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategy to license and/or monetize the value of our intellectual property through enforcement or other strategies may not be successful.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this filing, we maintain an active licensing program related to our \u2018972 patent family, and we are in the process of developing a campaign to monetize our non-\u2018972 patents.\nOur strategy to monetize our non-\u2018972 patents is in the preliminary stage. At this time, with the assistance of third party consultants, we are developing a strategy to pursue one or more alternative methods of monetizing the non-\u2018972 patents, which may include one or more of the following strategies:\n\u00b7 a sale of all or a portion of the patent family;\n\u00b7 pursuing litigation against companies we believe are infringing our rights under this patent family in order to encourage these companies to take a license to our technology (whether alone or in partnership with a law firm or firms that may take a contingent recovery);\n\u00b7 one or more strategic partnerships with a patent monetization company, in which case we would share a portion of the license revenues with the strategic partners taking responsibility for some or all expenses related to licensing (including litigation); or\n\u00b7 entering into arrangements with lenders or financial partners in order to fund litigation.\nSome of these strategies could be costly, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fund such strategies ourselves nor be able to raise financing or enter into a partnership to provide for such funding. We cannot predict with certainty the time it would take to achieve any revenues from such strategies, and we cannot assure you such activities will, in fact, generate revenue. As stated above, there also are contractual limits on our ability to monetize our non-\u2018972 patents.\nRisks Related to Capitalization Matters and Corporate Governance\nThe share price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in these risk factors and elsewhere in our reports and other documents filed with the SEC, factors that may cause volatility in our share price include:\n\u00b7 our ability to meet our working capital needs;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts who may cover our stock or by our failure to meet the estimates made by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of other similar companies;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of new products or of significant technical innovations, contracts, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic relationships or joint ventures;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 any deviations in net sales or in losses from levels expected by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 unfavorable legal or regulatory rulings associated with the enforcement of our IP rights;\n\u00b7 the realization of any of the risk factors presented in this annual report; and\n\u00b7 future sales of common stock.\nFurthermore, the stock markets recently have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, international currency fluctuations or political unrest, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may depend on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over research and reports these analysts publish or whether they will be published at all. If one or more of the analysts who decide to cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIf our common stock is delisted, the market value of, and your ability to transfer or sell, shares of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn order to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are required to meet specified financial requirements, including requirements that we maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for our common stock and that we maintain (i) a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of $2,500,000, (ii) a minimum market value of listed common stock of $35,000,000, or (iii) net income from continuing operations of at least $500,000 in the most recent fiscal year or two of the last three fiscal years.\nWe face a challenging liquidity environment and may require additional financing, which could be difficult to obtain on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain necessary financing or doing so on unfavorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have historically relied on outside financing, cash flows from operations, and IP licensing and settlement revenue to fund our operations, capital expenditures and expansion. We currently face a difficult liquidity environment. We may require additional capital from equity or debt financings in the future to fund our operations, respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities or pursue our intellectual property monetization strategy.\nWe may not be able to secure timely additional financing arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any additional financing may limit our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business, to respond to business challenges and to pursue our intellectual property monetization strategy could be significantly limited.\nOur system of internal controls may be inadequate.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls in order to ensure we are able to collect, process, summarize, and disclose the information required by the SEC within the time periods specified. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Due to these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Additionally, public companies in the United States are required to review their internal controls under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If the internal controls put in place by us are not adequate or fail to perform as anticipated, errors could occur that would not be detected, which could require us to restate our consolidated financial statements, result in an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or require us to take other actions that will divert significant financial and managerial resources, as well as be subject to fines and/or other government enforcement actions. Furthermore, the price of our stock could be adversely affected and our investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.\nWe do not presently intend to repurchase any shares of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends is limited by law.\nHolders of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries F Preferred Stock\u201d) have the right to receive dividends that accrue at a rate of 5.00% annually, are payable on June 30 and December 31 of each year, and are payable, at our option, in cash or common stock with reference to the volume-weighted-average price of our common stock on its principle trading market.\nExcept as required by the terms of our preferred stock, any payment of future dividends on our securities will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Cash dividend payments in the future may only be made out of legally available funds and, if we experience substantial losses, such funds may not be available.\nOur convertible preferred stock contains covenants that may limit our business flexibility.\nOur convertible preferred stock contains covenants preventing us from taking certain actions without the approval of the holders of a majority or a super-majority of the convertible preferred stock, depending on the action as described below. The need to obtain the approval of holders of our convertible preferred stock before taking these actions could impede our ability to take certain actions that management or our Board of Directors may consider to be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nFor as long as at least 20% of the shares of our convertible preferred stock issued in our March 2013 private placement are outstanding, we may not take any of the following actions, among others, without first obtaining the approval of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of convertible preferred stock then outstanding:\n\u00b7 create a new class or series of equity securities or any other security convertible into equity securities ranking senior or pari passu to the convertible preferred stock with respect to voting, dividends, or liquidation rights;\n\u00b7 amend, alter, or repeal any of our governing documents in a manner materially adverse to our convertible preferred stock;\n\u00b7 declare or pay a dividend or distribution on any securities, including our common stock, prior to the payment of the dividends required to be paid to holders of our convertible preferred stock; or\n\u00b7 repurchase or otherwise acquire more than a de minimis number of shares of any class of securities junior to the convertible preferred stock (which includes our common stock), except with respect to (1) shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of shares of our convertible preferred stock or the exercise of warrants issued in our March 2013 private placement, or (2) repurchases of certain securities held by our departing officers and directors up to an aggregate maximum of $100,000.\nFor as long as at least 20% of the shares of our convertible preferred stock issued in our March 2013 private placement are outstanding, we also may not take any of the following actions, among others, without first obtaining the approval of the holders of at least 70% of the shares of convertible preferred stock then outstanding:\n\u00b7 sell (outside the ordinary course) or hypothecate any of our current or future assets (other than for hypothecations pursuant to and consistent with our existing working capital arrangements); or\n\u00b7 incur any new debt (including redeemable preferred stock), other than pursuant to our existing working capital relationship and trade debt incurred in the ordinary course of business; provided , however, that the foregoing restrictions will not apply to:\n\u00b7 any assignment, conveyance, disposition, encumbrance, hypothecation, pledge, lease, sale, transfer or other disposition our intellectual property that (1) generates net proceeds of at least $3 million and (2) does not cause a material adverse effect on us or our current and anticipated operations, and\n\u00b7 license arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nIn March 2016, we received the requisite 70% approval for the sale of our product business.We cannot assure you that the holders of our convertible preferred stock would in the future approve any such restricted action, even where we believe such an action would be in the best interests of our stockholders. Any failure to obtain such approval could limit our business flexibility, harm our business and result in a decrease in the value of our common stock or convertible preferred stock.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel on a cost-effective basis, our business would be harmed.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon the performance of our senior management. Our management and employees can terminate their employment at any time, and the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we were unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel on a cost-effective basis, our business would be harmed.\nWe do not have cumulative voting and a small number of existing stockholders exert significant control over our company, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of stockholder votes.\nOur stockholders do not have the right to cumulative votes in the election of our directors. Cumulative voting, in some cases, could allow a minority group to elect at least one director to our Board of Directors. Because there is no provision for cumulative voting, a minority group will not be able to elect any directors. Accordingly, the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock, present in person or by proxy, will be able to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors.\nOur executive officers and directors, together with our largest stockholders, beneficially own a significant amount of our common stock as of January 20, 2017. As a result, these persons may be able to exercise significant influence over the outcome of stockholders votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our charter or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions.\nFrom time to time we may make acquisitions. The failure to successfully integrate future acquisitions could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we have in the past and may make acquisitions in the future. We may also make significant investments in companies, products or technologies. If we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or significant investments, it could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Risks that we may face in our efforts to integrate any recent or future acquisitions include, among others:\n\u00b7 failure to realize anticipated savings and benefits from the acquisition;\n\u00b7 difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees;\n\u00b7 potential incompatibility of business cultures;\n\u00b7 coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u00b7 coordinating infrastructure operations in a rapid and efficient manner;\n\u00b7 the potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into our products and services;\n\u00b7 potential difficulties in monetizing or defending our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7 failure of acquired technology or products to provide anticipated revenue or margin contribution;\n\u00b7 insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition;\n\u00b7 costs and delays in implementing or integrating common systems and procedures;\n\u00b7 reduction or loss of customer orders due to the potential for market confusion, hesitation and delay;\n\u00b7 impairment of existing customer, supplier and strategic relationships of either company;\n\u00b7 insufficient cash flows from operations to fund the working capital and investment requirements;\n\u00b7 difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u00b7 the possibility that we may not receive a favorable return on our investment, the original investment may become impaired or we may incur losses from these investments;\n\u00b7 dissatisfaction or performance problems with the acquired company;\n\u00b7 the assumption of risks of the acquired company that are difficult to quantify, such as litigation;\n\u00b7 the cost associated with the acquisition; and\n\u00b7 assumption of unknown liabilities or other unanticipated adverse events or circumstances.\nAcquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any business, products, technologies or personnel that we may acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. For example, in 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, as we continue to review and monitor this new law and its associated regulations, we expect to incur additional operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThese laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as regulatory and governing bodies provide new guidance. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nAs a public company that is subject to these rules and regulations, we may find that it is more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors and qualified executive officers.\nWe are subject to risks related to the provision of employee health care benefits and recent health care reform legislation.\nIn March 2010, comprehensive health care reform legislation under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education and Affordability Reconciliation Act was passed and signed into law. Provisions of the health reform legislation become effective at various dates over the next several years, and many of the regulations and guidance with respect to the health care reform legislation have not been implemented. Due to the breadth and complexity of the health reform legislation, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, and the phased-in nature of the implementation, it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the health reform legislation on our business over the coming years. Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected due to this health reform legislation.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 the rights of the holders of our convertible preferred stock to elect one director;\n\u00b7 the rights of the holders of our convertible preferred stock to approve certain transactions and corporate actions;\n\u00b7 no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7 the exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u00b7 the ability of our Board of Directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u00b7 a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7 the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our Board of Directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u00b7 advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction.\nWe have a history of losses and we may not be able to sustain profitability in the future.\nFor the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded net losses of approximately $0.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively. We may incur additional losses in future periods. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including those discussed in other risk factors and factors that we cannot foresee.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) or recognize tax benefits on future domestic taxable income may be limited.\nOur ability to fully utilize our existing NOLs could be limited or eliminated in various ways: (i) if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code. An \u201cownership change\u201d is generally defined as greater than a 50% change in equity ownership by value over a rolling three-year period. We may experience an \u201cownership change\u201d in the future as a result of changes in our common stock ownership, which would result in a limitation on our ability to utilize our NOLs; (ii) due to changes in federal laws and regulations that could negatively impact our ability to recognize benefits from our NOLs; or (iii) should we not reach profitability or be only marginally profitable prior to the expiration of the NOLs. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income to be able to utilize our NOLs prior to their expiration.\nWe adopted a tax benefits preservation plan, designed to preserve the value of certain income tax assets, primarily tax NOLs, which may discourage acquisition and sale of large blocks of our stock and may result in significant dilution for certain stockholders.\nOn May 23, 2014, we adopted a tax benefits preservation plan (the \u201cTax Benefit Preservation Plan\u201d). The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan is designed to preserve stockholder value and the value of certain income tax assets primarily associated with NOLs by acting as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock (including shares of Series F Preferred Stock) without the approval of the Board of Directors. The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan may discourage existing 5% stockholders from selling their interest in a single block which may impact the liquidity of our common stock, may deter institutional investors from investing in our stock, and may deter potential acquirers from making premium offers to acquire us. These factors may depress the market price of our stock.", "PERMNO": 87310, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "CRSS"}
