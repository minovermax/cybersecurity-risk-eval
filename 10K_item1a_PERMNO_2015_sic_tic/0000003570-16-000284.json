We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nThe risk factors in this report are grouped into the following categories:\n\u2022\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Matters;\n\u2022\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Terminal Business;\n\u2022\nRisks Relating to Our LNG and Natural Gas Marketing Business;\n\u2022\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Businesses in General; and\n\u2022\nRisks Relating to Our Business in General.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Matters\nOur significant debt could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $17.3 billion of total debt outstanding on a consolidated basis (before debt discounts and debt premiums), excluding $135.2 million of outstanding letters of credit. We incur, and will incur, significant interest expense relating to the assets at the Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi LNG terminals, and we anticipate needing to incur substantial additional debt and issue equity to finance the construction of Train 6 of the SPL Project and Train 3 of the CCL Project. Our ability to fund our capital expenditures and refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to access additional project financing as well as the debt and equity capital markets. A variety of factors beyond our control could impact the availability or cost of capital, including domestic or international economic conditions, increases in key benchmark interest rates and/or credit spreads, the adoption of new or amended banking or capital market laws or regulations, the re-pricing of market risks and volatility in capital and financial markets. Our financing costs could increase or future borrowings or equity offerings may be unavailable to us or unsuccessful, which could cause us to be unable to pay or refinance our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We also rely on borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our capital expenditures. If any of the lenders in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments, we may need to seek replacement financing, which may not be available as needed, or may be available in more limited amounts or on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms.\nWe have not been profitable historically, and we have not had positive operating cash flow. We may not achieve profitability or generate positive operating cash flow in the future.\nWe had net losses of $975.1 million, $547.9 million and $507.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, our net cash flow used in operating activities was $265.6 million, $124.1 and $52.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures while we develop and construct the SPL Project and the CCL Project. We currently expect that we will not begin to receive cash flows from operations under any SPA until early 2016, at the earliest. Any delays beyond the expected development period for Train 1 of the SPL Project would prolong, and could increase the level of, operating losses and negative operating cash flows. Our future liquidity may also be affected by the timing of construction financing availability in relation to the incurrence of construction costs and other outflows and by the timing of receipt of cash flows under SPAs in relation to the incurrence of project and operating expenses. Moreover, many factors (including factors beyond our control) could result in a disparity between liquidity sources and cash needs, including factors such as construction delays and breaches of agreements. Our ability to generate any significant positive operating cash flow and achieve profitability in the future is dependent on our ability to successfully and timely complete the applicable Train.\nWe may sell equity or equity-related securities or assets, including equity interests in Cheniere Partners or Cheniere Holdings. Such sales could dilute our stockholders\u2019 proportionate indirect interests in our assets, business operations and proposed liquefaction and other projects of Cheniere Partners or other subsidiaries, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have pursued and are pursuing a number of alternatives in order to finance the construction of Train 6 of the SPL Project and Train 3 of the CCL Project, including potential issuances and sales of additional equity or equity-related securities by us, Cheniere Partners, or Cheniere Holdings. Such sales, in one or more transactions, could dilute our stockholders\u2019 proportionate indirect interests in our assets, business operations and proposed projects of Cheniere Partners, including the SPL Project, or in other subsidiaries or projects, including the CCL Project. In addition, such sales, or the anticipation of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of our convertible notes.\nIn November 2014, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion Convertible Unsecured Notes due 2021 (the \u201c2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes\u201d) to RRJ Capital II Ltd, Baytree Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd and Seatown Lionfish Pte. Ltd. In March 2015, we issued $625.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2045 (the \u201c2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes\u201d) to certain investors through a registered direct offering. In May 2015, CCH HoldCo II issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 11% Convertible Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes\u201d and together with the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes and the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes, the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) to EIG Management Company, LLC. We have the option to satisfy the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes and the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes conversion obligations with cash, common stock or a combination thereof. The 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes conversion obligations must be satisfied with common stock. The 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes are convertible at an initial conversion price of $93.64. Prior to December 15, 2044, the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible upon the occurrence of certain conditions, and on and after such date they will become freely convertible. The 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes will become convertible into the common stock of Cheniere at an initial conversion price of $138.38 per share. Provided the total market capitalization of Cheniere at that time is not less than $10.0 billion, the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible at CCH HoldCo II\u2019s option on or after the later of (1) 58 months from May 1, 2015, and (2) the substantial completion of Train 2 of the CCL Project (the \u201cEligible Conversion Date\u201d). The conversion price for 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes converted at CCH HoldCo II\u2019s option is the lower of (1) a 10% discount to the average of the daily volume-weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) of our common stock for the 90 trading day period prior to the date on which notice of conversion is provided, and (2) a 10% discount to the closing price of our common stock on the trading day preceding the date on which notice of conversion is provided. At the option of the holders, the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes are convertible on or after the six-month anniversary of the Eligible Conversion Date, provided the total market capitalization of Cheniere at that time is not less than $10.0 billion, at a conversion price equal to the average of the daily VWAP of our common stock for the 90 trading day period prior to the date on which notice of conversion is provided. The conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership percentages and voting power of our existing stockholders. Based on the initial conversion price, if we elect to satisfy the entire conversion obligations of the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes and the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes with common stock, an aggregate of approximately 22.3 million shares of our common stock would be issued upon the conversion, assuming the notes are converted at maturity and all interest on the notes is paid in kind for the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes. Because the conversion rate for the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes will depend on the price of our common stock at the time of conversion, we cannot meaningfully estimate the number of shares of our common stock, if any, that would be issued upon the conversion of such notes; however, under these convertible notes, a maximum of 47,108,466 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split) may be issued in the aggregate upon the conversion of all of the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes. Any sales in the public market of the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes could adversely affect the prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur ability to generate cash is substantially dependent upon the performance by customers under long-term contracts that we have entered into, and we could be materially and adversely affected if any customer fails to perform its contractual obligations for any reason.\nOur future results and liquidity are substantially dependent upon performance by Chevron and Total, each of which has entered into a TUA with SPLNG and agreed to pay SPLNG approximately $125 million annually, and upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent to payment thereunder, by six third-party customers that have entered into SPAs with SPL and agreed to pay SPL an aggregate of $2.9 billion annually in fixed fees; and upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent to payment thereunder, by six third-party customers that have entered into SPAs with CCL for Trains 1 and 2 and agreed to pay an aggregate of $1.4 billion annually in fixed fees. We are dependent on each customer\u2019s continued willingness and ability to perform its obligations under its SPA. We are also exposed to the credit risk of any guarantor of these customers\u2019 obligations under their respective TUA or SPA in the event that we must seek recourse under a guaranty. If any customer fails to perform its obligations under its TUA or SPA, our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects could be materially and adversely affected, even if we were ultimately successful in seeking damages from that customer or its guarantor for a breach of the TUA or SPA.\nEach of our customer contracts is subject to termination under certain circumstances.\nEach of SPLNG\u2019s long-term TUAs contains various termination rights. For example, each customer may terminate its TUA if the Sabine Pass LNG terminal experiences a force majeure delay for longer than 18 months, fails to redeliver a specified amount of natural gas in accordance with the customer\u2019s redelivery nominations or fails to accept and unload a specified number of the customer\u2019s proposed LNG cargoes. SPLNG may not be able to replace these TUAs on desirable terms, or at all, if they are terminated.\nEach of the SPAs contains various termination rights allowing our customers to terminate their SPAs, including, without limitation: (1) upon the occurrence of certain events of force majeure; (2) if we fail to make available specified scheduled cargo quantities; and (3) delays in the commencement of commercial operations. SPL or CCL, as applicable, may not be able to replace these SPAs on desirable terms, or at all, if they are terminated.\nOur subsidiaries may be restricted under the terms of their indebtedness from making distributions under certain circumstances, which may limit Cheniere Partners\u2019 ability to pay or increase distributions to us or inhibit our access to cash flows from the CCL Project and could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe agreements governing our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness restrict payments that our subsidiaries can make to Cheniere Partners or us in certain events and limit the indebtedness that our subsidiaries can incur. For example, SPLNG may not make distributions until, among other requirements, a deposit has been made in an interest payment account for one-sixth of the semi-annual interest payment multiplied by the number of elapsed months since the last semi-annual interest payment, a deposit has been made to a permanent debt service reserve fund for one semi-annual interest payment and a fixed charge coverage ratio test of 2:1 is satisfied. SPLNG is not permitted to make cash distributions if its consolidated cash flow is not at least twice its fixed charges, calculated as required in the indentures governing the $1.7 billion of 7.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 and $0.4 billion of 6.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2020, both issued by SPLNG (the \u201cSPLNG Indentures\u201d). In order to satisfy this fixed charge coverage ratio test, we estimate that SPLNG\u2019s consolidated cash flow, as defined in such indentures, must be greater than approximately $340 million. Thus, TUA payments from SPL and either Chevron or Total are needed to satisfy the test. If the fixed charge coverage ratio test is not satisfied, SPLNG will not be permitted by the SPLNG Indentures to make distributions to Cheniere Partners, which may prevent Cheniere Partners from making distributions to us and its other unitholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nSPL is likewise restricted from making distributions under agreements governing its indebtedness generally until, among other requirements, substantial completion of Trains 1 and 2 of the SPL Project has occurred, deposits are made into debt service reserve accounts and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25:1.00 is satisfied.\nCCH is restricted from making distributions under agreements governing its indebtedness generally until, among other requirements, the completion of the construction of Trains 1 and 2 of the CCL Project, funding of a debt service reserve account equal to six months of debt service and achieving a historical debt service coverage ratio and fixed projected debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00.\nCCH HoldCo II is restricted from making distributions to Cheniere under agreements governing its indebtedness generally until, among other requirements, Trains 1 and 2 of the CCL Project are in commercial operation and a historical debt service coverage ratio and a projected fixed debt services coverage ratio of 1.20:1.00 are achieved.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 inability to pay distributions to Cheniere Partners or us to incur additional indebtedness as a result of the foregoing restrictions in the agreements governing their indebtedness may inhibit Cheniere Partners\u2019 ability to pay or increase distributions to us and its other unitholders or inhibit our access to cash flows from the CCL Project, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nRestrictions in agreements governing our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness may prevent our subsidiaries from engaging in certain beneficial transactions.\nIn addition to restrictions on the ability of SPLNG, SPL, CCH and CCH HoldCo II to make distributions or incur additional indebtedness, the agreements governing their indebtedness also contain various other covenants that may prevent them from engaging in beneficial transactions, including limitations on their ability to:\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\npurchase, redeem or retire equity interests;\n\u2022\nissue preferred stock;\n\u2022\nsell or transfer assets;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of its assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nOur use of hedging arrangements may adversely affect our future operating results or liquidity.\nTo reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price, volume and timing risk associated with the purchase of natural gas, we use futures, swaps and option contracts traded or cleared on the Intercontinental Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange or over-the-counter options and swaps with other natural gas merchants and financial institutions. Hedging arrangements would expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nexpected supply is less than the amount hedged;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022\nthere is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received.\nThe use of derivatives also may require the posting of cash collateral with counterparties, which can impact working capital when commodity prices change.\nThe swaps regulatory and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules adopted thereunder and other regulations, including EMIR and REMIT, could adversely affect our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and our operating results and cash flows.\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) establishes federal regulation of the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives market and made other amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act that are relevant to our business. The provisions of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules adopted thereunder by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d), the SEC and other federal regulators may adversely affect our ability to manage certain of our risks on a cost effective basis. Such laws and regulations may also adversely affect our ability to execute our strategies with respect to hedging our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributable to the future sale of our LNG inventory and to price risk attributable to future purchases of natural gas to be utilized as fuel to operate our LNG terminals and to secure natural gas feedstock for our liquefaction facilities.\nThe CFTC has proposed new rules setting limits on the positions in certain core futures contracts, economically equivalent futures contracts, options contracts and swaps for or linked to certain physical commodities, including Henry Hub natural gas, held by market participants, with limited exemptions for certain bona fide hedging and other types of transactions. Under the CFTC\u2019s proposed rules regarding aggregation of positions, a party that controls the trading of, or owns 10% or more of the equity interests in, another party will have to aggregate the positions of the controlled party with its own positions for purposes of determining compliance with position limits unless an exemption applies. Upon the adoption and effectiveness of final CFTC position limits and aggregation rules, our ability to execute our hedging strategies described above could be limited. It is uncertain at this time whether, when and in what form the CFTC\u2019s proposed new position limits and aggregation rules may become final and effective.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules adopted thereunder, we may be required to clear through a derivatives clearing organization any swaps into which we enter that fall within a class of swaps designated by the CFTC for mandatory clearing and we could have to execute trades in such swaps on certain trading platforms. The CFTC has designated six classes of interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing, but has not yet proposed rules designating any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, for mandatory clearing. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements for our swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, if we fail to qualify for that exception as to any swap we enter into and have to clear that swap through a derivatives clearing organization, we could be required to post margin with respect to such swap, our cost of entering into and maintaining such swap could increase and we would not enjoy the same flexibility with the cleared swaps that we enjoy with the uncleared OTC swaps we enter. Moreover, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging.\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC and the federal banking regulators have adopted rules requiring certain market participants to collect margin with respect to uncleared swaps from their counterparties that are financial end users and certain registered swap dealers and major swap participants. The requirements of those rules are to be phased in commencing on September 1, 2016. Although we believe we will qualify as a non-financial end user for purposes of these rules, were we not to do so and have to post margin as to our uncleared swaps in the future, our cost of entering into and maintaining swaps would be increased. Our counterparties that are subject to the regulations imposing the Basel III capital requirements on them may increase the cost to us of entering into swaps with them or, although not required to collect margin from us under the margin rules, require us to post collateral with them in connection with such swaps in order to offset their increased capital costs or to reduce their capital costs to maintain those swaps on their balance sheets.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also imposes regulatory requirements on swaps market participants, including swap dealers and other swaps entities as well as certain regulations on end users of swaps, including regulations relating to swap documentation, reporting and recordkeeping, and certain business conduct rules applicable to swap dealers and other swaps entities. Together with the Basel III capital requirements on certain swaps market participants, these regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post margin or collateral), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against certain risks that we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and to execute our hedging strategies. If, as a result of the swaps regulatory regime discussed above, we were to reduce our use of swaps to hedge our risks, such as commodity price risks that we encounter in our operations, our operating results and cash flows may become more volatile and could be otherwise adversely affected.\nEMIR may result in increased costs for OTC derivative counterparties and also lead to an increase in the costs of, and demand for, the liquid collateral that EMIR requires central counterparties to accept. Although we expect to qualify as a non-financial counterparty under EMIR and thus not be required to post margin under EMIR, our subsidiaries and affiliates operating in the EU may still be subject to increased regulatory requirements, including recordkeeping, marking to market, timely confirmations, derivatives reporting, portfolio reconciliation and dispute resolution procedures. Regulation under EMIR could significantly increase the cost of derivatives contracts, materially alter the terms of derivatives contracts and reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter. The increased trading costs and collateral costs may have an adverse impact on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOur subsidiaries and affiliates operating in the EU may be subject to REMIT as wholesale energy market participants. This classification imposes increased regulatory obligations on our subsidiaries and affiliates, including a prohibition to use or disclose insider information or to engage in market manipulation in wholesale energy markets, and an obligation to report certain data. These regulatory obligations may increase the cost of compliance for our business and if we violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to investigation and penalties.\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Terminal Business\nOperation of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, the SPL Project and the CCL Project and other facilities that we may construct involves significant risks.\nAs more fully discussed in these Risk Factors, the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, the SPL Project and the CCL Project and our other existing and proposed LNG facilities face operational risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe facilities\u2019 performing below expected levels of efficiency;\n\u2022\nbreakdown or failures of equipment;\n\u2022\noperational errors by vessel or tug operators;\n\u2022\noperational errors by us or any contracted facility operator;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes; and\n\u2022\nweather-related interruptions of operations.\nWe may not be successful in implementing our proposed business strategy to provide liquefaction capabilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities or the CCL Project.\nIt will take several years to construct the SPL Project and the CCL Project, and even if successfully constructed, the SPL Project and the CCL Project would be subject to the operating risks described herein. Accordingly, there are many risks associated with the SPL Project and the CCL Project, and if we are not successful in implementing our business strategy, we may not be able to generate cash flows, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nCost overruns and delays in the completion of one or more Trains or the Corpus Christi Pipeline, as well as difficulties in obtaining sufficient financing to pay for such costs and delays, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThe actual construction costs of the Trains or the Corpus Christi Pipeline may be significantly higher than our current estimates as a result of many factors, including change orders under existing or future EPC contracts resulting from the occurrence of certain specified events that may give Bechtel the right to cause us to enter into change orders or resulting from changes with which we otherwise agree. We do not have any prior experience in constructing liquefaction facilities, and no liquefaction facilities have been constructed and placed in service in the United States in over 40 years. As construction progresses, we may decide or be forced to submit change orders to our contractor that could result in longer construction periods, higher construction costs or both.\nDelays in the construction of one or more Trains or the Corpus Christi Pipeline beyond the estimated development periods, as well as change orders to the EPC contracts with Bechtel or any future EPC contract related to additional Trains or the Corpus Christi Pipeline, could increase the cost of completion beyond the amounts that we estimate, which could require us to obtain additional sources of financing to fund our operations until the applicable liquefaction project is constructed (which could cause further delays). Our ability to obtain financing that may be needed to provide additional funding to cover increased costs will depend, in part, on factors beyond our control. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain financing, we may have to accept terms that are disadvantageous to us or that may have a material adverse effect on our current or future business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nDelays in the completion of one or more Trains could lead to reduced revenues or termination of one or more of the SPAs by our counterparties.\nAny delay in completion of a Train could cause a delay in the receipt of revenues projected therefrom or cause a loss of one or more customers in the event of significant delays. As a result, any significant construction delay, whatever the cause, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOur ability to complete development of additional Trains will be contingent on our ability to obtain additional funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we may be unable to complete our business plan and our business may ultimately be unsuccessful.\nWe will require significant additional funding to be able to commence construction of Train 6 of the SPL Project and Train 3 of the CCL Project, which we may not be able to obtain at a cost that results in positive economics, or at all. The inability to achieve acceptable funding may cause a delay in the development of additional Trains, and we may not be able to complete our business plan. Even if we are able to obtain funding, the funding may be inadequate to cover any increases in costs or delays in completion of the applicable Train, which may cause a delay in the receipt of revenues projected therefrom or cause a loss of one or more customers in the event of significant delays. As a result, any significant construction delay, whatever the cause, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nTo maintain the cryogenic readiness of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, SPLNG may need to purchase and process LNG. SPLNG\u2019s TUA customers, including SPL, have the obligation to procure LNG if necessary for the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to maintain its cryogenic state. If they fail to do so, SPLNG may need to procure such LNG.\nSPLNG needs to maintain the cryogenic readiness of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. Together with SPL, the two third-party TUA customers have the obligation to maintain minimum inventory levels, and, under certain circumstances, to procure LNG to maintain the cryogenic readiness of the terminal. In the event that aggregate minimum inventory levels are not maintained, SPLNG has the right to procure a cryogenic readiness cargo to cure a minimum inventory condition, and to be reimbursed by each TUA customer for their allocable share of the LNG acquisition costs. If SPLNG is not able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it will need to maintain sufficient working capital for such a purchase until it receives reimbursement for the allocable costs of the LNG from its TUA customers or sells the regasified LNG.\nSPLNG may be required to purchase natural gas to provide fuel at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, which would increase operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nSPLNG\u2019s TUAs provide for an in-kind deduction of 2% of the LNG delivered to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, which it uses primarily as fuel for revaporization and self-generated power and to cover natural gas unavoidably lost at the facility. There is a risk that this 2% in-kind deduction will be insufficient for these needs and that SPLNG will have to purchase additional natural gas from third parties. SPLNG will bear the cost and risk of changing prices for any such fuel.\nHurricanes or other disasters could result in an interruption of our operations, a delay in the completion of our liquefaction projects, higher construction costs and the deferral of the dates on which payments are due under the SPAs, all of which could adversely affect us.\nIn August and September of 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, respectively, damaged coastal and inland areas located in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, resulting in the temporary suspension of construction of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. In September 2008, Hurricane Ike struck the Texas and Louisiana coast, and the Sabine Pass LNG terminal experienced minor damage.\nFuture storms and related storm activity and collateral effects, or other disasters such as explosions, fires, floods or accidents, could result in damage to, or interruption of operations at, the Sabine Pass LNG terminal or related infrastructure, as well as delays or cost increases in the construction and the development of the SPL Project, the CCL Project or our other facilities. Changes in the global climate may have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and rising sea levels; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our coastal operations.\nFailure to obtain and maintain approvals and permits from governmental and regulatory agencies with respect to the design, construction and operation of our facilities could impede operations and construction and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe design, construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines, LNG terminals, including the SPL Project and the CCL Project and other facilities, and the import and export of LNG and the transportation of natural gas, are highly regulated activities. Approvals of the FERC and DOE under Section 3 and Section 7 of the NGA, as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits, including several under the CAA and the CWA, are required in order to construct and operate an LNG facility and an interstate natural gas pipeline and export LNG. Although the FERC has issued an order under Section 3\nof the NGA authorizing the siting, construction and operation of six Trains of the SPL Project and an order authorizing the siting, construction and operation of three trains of the CCL Project, the FERC orders require us to obtain certain additional approvals in conjunction with ongoing construction and operations of our liquefaction facilities. We also have two pending applications with the DOE for authorization to export LNG to non-FTA countries in addition to the orders previously granted to us by the DOE. Authorizations obtained from other federal and state regulatory agencies also contain ongoing conditions, and additional approval and permit requirements may be imposed. We cannot control the outcome of the review and approval process. We do not know whether or when any such approvals or permits can be obtained, or whether or not any existing or potential interventions or other actions by third parties will interfere with our ability to obtain and maintain such permits or approvals. If we are unable to obtain and maintain the necessary approvals and permits, we may not be able to recover our investment in our projects. There is no assurance that we will obtain and maintain these governmental permits, approvals and authorizations, or that we will be able to obtain them on a timely basis, and failure to obtain and maintain any of these permits, approvals or authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe are dependent on Bechtel and other contractors for the successful completion of the SPL Project and the CCL Project.\nTimely and cost-effective completion of the SPL Project and the CCL Project in compliance with agreed specifications is central to our business strategy and is highly dependent on the performance of Bechtel and our other contractors under their agreements. The ability of Bechtel and our other contractors to perform successfully under their agreements is dependent on a number of factors, including their ability to:\n\u2022\ndesign and engineer each Train to operate in accordance with specifications;\n\u2022\nengage and retain third-party subcontractors and procure equipment and supplies;\n\u2022\nrespond to difficulties such as equipment failure, delivery delays, schedule changes and failure to perform by subcontractors, some of which are beyond their control;\n\u2022\nattract, develop and retain skilled personnel, including engineers;\n\u2022\npost required construction bonds and comply with the terms thereof;\n\u2022\nmanage the construction process generally, including coordinating with other contractors and regulatory agencies; and\n\u2022\nmaintain their own financial condition, including adequate working capital.\nAlthough some agreements may provide for liquidated damages if the contractor fails to perform in the manner required with respect to certain of its obligations, the events that trigger a requirement to pay liquidated damages may delay or impair the operation of the applicable liquefaction facility, and any liquidated damages that we receive may not be sufficient to cover the damages that we suffer as a result of any such delay or impairment. The obligations of Bechtel and our other contractors to pay liquidated damages under their agreements are subject to caps on liability, as set forth therein. Furthermore, we may have disagreements with our contractors about different elements of the construction process, which could lead to the assertion of rights and remedies under their contracts and increase the cost of the applicable liquefaction facility or result in a contractor\u2019s unwillingness to perform further work. If any contractor is unable or unwilling to perform according to the negotiated terms and timetable of its respective agreement for any reason or terminates its agreement, we would be required to engage a substitute contractor. This would likely result in significant project delays and increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe are relying on third-party engineers to estimate the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the SPL Project and the CCL Project, and these estimates may prove to be inaccurate.\nWe are relying on third parties, principally Bechtel, for the design and engineering services underlying our estimates of the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the SPL Project and the CCL Project. If any Train, when actually constructed, fails to have the capacity ratings and performance capabilities that we intend, our estimates may not be accurate. Failure of any of our Trains to achieve our intended capacity ratings and performance capabilities could prevent us from achieving the commercial start dates under our SPAs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities are or become unavailable to transport natural gas, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe will depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that will provide gas delivery options to our liquefaction facilities and pipelines. If the construction of new or modified pipeline connections is not completed on schedule or any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, our ability to meet our SPA obligations and continue shipping natural gas from producing regions or to end markets could be restricted, thereby reducing our revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient natural gas to satisfy our delivery obligations under the SPAs, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nUnder the SPAs with our liquefaction customers, we are required to deliver to them a specified amount of LNG at specified times. However, we may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of natural gas to satisfy those delivery obligations, which may provide affected SPA customers with the right to terminate their SPAs. Our failure to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines and their FERC gas tariffs are subject to FERC regulation.\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA and under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The FERC regulates the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the construction and operation of our pipelines, the rates and terms of conditions of service and abandonment of facilities. Under the NGA, the rates charged by our interstate natural gas pipelines must be just and reasonable, and we are prohibited from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service. If we fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders, our interstate pipelines could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nOur FERC gas tariffs, including our pro forma transportation agreements, must be filed and approved by the FERC. Before we enter into a transportation agreement with a shipper that contains a term that materially deviates from our tariff, we must seek FERC approval. The FERC may approve the material deviation in the transportation agreement; however, in that case, the materially deviating terms must be made available to our other similarly-situated customers. If we fail to seek FERC approval of a transportation agreement that materially deviates from our tariff, or if the FERC audits our contracts and finds deviations that appear to be unduly discriminatory, the FERC could conduct a formal enforcement investigation, resulting in serious penalties and/or onerous ongoing compliance obligations.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the EPAct, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1.0 million per day for each violation.\nPipeline safety integrity programs and repairs may impose significant costs and liabilities on us.\nThe federal Office of Pipeline Safety requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in \u201chigh consequence areas\u201d where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. As an operator, we are required to:\n\u2022\nperform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n\u2022\nidentify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;\n\u2022\nimprove data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022\nrepair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and\n\u2022\nimplement preventative and mitigating actions.\nWe are required to maintain pipeline integrity testing programs that are intended to assess pipeline integrity. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures. Should we fail to\ncomply with the Office of Pipeline Safety\u2019s rules and related regulations and orders, we could be subject to significant penalties and fines.\nAny reduction in the capacity of, or the allocations to, interconnecting, third-party pipelines could cause a reduction of volumes transported in our pipelines, which would adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.\nWe will be dependent upon third-party pipelines and other facilities to provide delivery options to and from our pipelines. If any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, our ability to continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted, thereby reducing our revenues. Any permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect which caused a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nFailure to obtain and maintain approvals and permits from governmental and regulatory agencies with respect to the development and operation of our interstate natural gas pipelines would have a detrimental effect on us and our pipeline projects.\nThe design, construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines and the transportation of natural gas are all highly regulated activities. The FERC\u2019s approval under Section 7 of the NGA, as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits, including several under the CAA and the CWA from the USACE and state environmental agencies, are required in order to construct and operate an interstate natural gas pipeline. We have no control over the outcome of the review and approval process. We do not know whether or when any such approvals or permits can be obtained, or whether or not any existing or potential interventions or other actions by third parties will interfere with our ability to obtain and maintain such permits or approvals. If we are unable to obtain and maintain the necessary approvals and permits, we may not be able to recover our investment in our pipeline projects. There is no assurance that we will obtain and maintain these governmental permits, approvals and authorizations, or that we will be able to obtain them on a timely basis, and failure to obtain and maintain any of these permits, approvals or authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we lose the right to situate our pipelines on property owned by third parties.\nWe do not own the land on which our pipelines are situated, and we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use rights. If we were to lose these rights or be required to relocate our pipelines, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our LNG and Natural Gas Marketing Business\nThe limited capital resources and credit available to our LNG and natural gas marketing business may limit our ability to develop that business.\nWe have limited capital available to our LNG and natural gas marketing business. The business also currently has limited access to third-party sources of financing. Other investment-grade marketing companies have greater financial resources than we do. Our LNG and natural gas marketing business continues to develop and implement its business strategy and may not generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to cover the significant fixed costs of the business.\nOur exposure to the performance and credit risks of counterparties under agreements may adversely affect our operating results, liquidity and access to financing.\nOur LNG and natural gas marketing business involves our entering into various purchase and sale, hedging and other transactions with numerous third parties (commonly referred to as \u201ccounterparties\u201d). In such arrangements, we are exposed to the performance and credit risks of our counterparties, including the risk that one or more counterparties fails to perform its obligation to make deliveries of commodities and/or to make payments. These risks may increase during periods of commodity price volatility. Defaults by suppliers and other counterparties may adversely affect our operating results, liquidity and access to financing.\nCheniere Marketing may not be able to contract with customers to facilitate the export of LNG on its chartered LNG vessels.\nCheniere Marketing has entered into SPAs with SPL and CCL pursuant to which Cheniere Marketing has the option to purchase LNG at the SPL Project and the CCL Project, respectively. Cheniere Marketing has also entered into LNG vessel charters in order to secure shipping capacity for the export of LNG to purchasers. Under the charters, some of which have terms of up to 5 years, Cheniere Marketing is obligated to make payments for these vessels regardless of use. However, Cheniere Marketing may not be able to enter into contracts with purchasers of LNG in quantities equivalent to the vessel capacities for which Cheniere Marketing is required to make payments. Failure to secure buyers for a sufficient amount of LNG could materially and adversely affect Cheniere Marketing\u2019s business, operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Businesses in General\nWe may not construct or operate all of our proposed LNG facilities or Trains or any additional LNG facilities or Trains beyond those currently planned, which could limit our growth prospects.\nWe may not construct some of our proposed LNG facilities or Trains, whether due to lack of commercial interest or inability to obtain financing or otherwise. Our ability to develop additional liquefaction facilities will also depend on the availability and pricing of LNG and natural gas in North America and other places around the world. Competitors may have longer operating histories, more development experience, greater name recognition, larger staffs and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources and access to sources of natural gas and LNG than we do. If we are unable or unwilling to construct and operate additional LNG facilities, our prospects for growth will be limited.\nOur cost estimates for Trains are subject to change as a result of cost overruns, change orders under existing or future construction contracts, changes in commodity prices (particularly nickel and steel), escalating labor costs and the potential need for additional funds to be expended to maintain construction schedules. In the event we experience cost overruns, delays or both, the amount of funding needed to complete a Train could exceed our available funds and result in our failure to complete such Train and thereby negatively impact our business and limit our growth prospects.\nCyclical or other changes in the demand for and price of LNG and natural gas may adversely affect our LNG business and the performance of our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nOur LNG business and the development of domestic LNG facilities and projects generally is based on assumptions about the future availability and price of natural gas and LNG and the prospects for international natural gas and LNG markets. Natural gas and LNG prices have been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to one or more of the following factors:\n\u2022\nadditions to competitive regasification capacity in North America, Europe, Asia and other markets, which could divert LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal;\n\u2022\ncompetitive liquefaction capacity in North America;\n\u2022\ninsufficient or oversupply of natural gas liquefaction or receiving capacity worldwide;\n\u2022\ninsufficient LNG tanker capacity;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nreduced demand and lower prices for natural gas;\n\u2022\nincreased natural gas production deliverable by pipelines, which could suppress demand for LNG;\n\u2022\ndecreased oil and natural gas exploration activities, which may decrease the production of natural gas;\n\u2022\ncost improvements that allow competitors to offer LNG regasification services or provide liquefaction capabilities at reduced prices;\n\u2022\nchanges in supplies of, and prices for, alternative energy sources such as coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy, which may reduce the demand for natural gas;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory, tax or other governmental policies regarding imported or exported LNG, natural gas or alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for imported or exported LNG and/or natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022\nadverse relative demand for LNG compared to other markets, which may decrease LNG imports into or exports from North America; and\n\u2022\ncyclical trends in general business and economic conditions that cause changes in the demand for natural gas.\nAdverse trends or developments affecting any of these factors could result in decreases in the prices of LNG and natural gas, which could materially and adversely affect the performance of our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nFailure of imported or exported LNG to be a competitive source of energy could adversely affect our customers and could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nCurrent operations at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal are dependent upon the ability of our TUA customers to import LNG supplies into the United States, which is primarily dependent upon LNG being a competitive source of energy in North America. In North America, due mainly to a historically abundant supply of natural gas and discoveries of substantial quantities of unconventional, or shale, natural gas, imported LNG has not developed into a significant energy source. The success of the regasification services component of our business plan is dependent, in part, on the extent to which LNG can, for significant periods and in significant volumes, be produced internationally and delivered to North America at a lower cost than the cost to produce some domestic supplies of natural gas, or other alternative energy sources. Through the use of improved exploration technologies, additional sources of natural gas have recently been and may continue to be discovered in North America, which could further increase the available supply of natural gas and could result in natural gas being available at a lower cost than imported LNG.\nOperations at the SPL Project and the CCL Project will be dependent upon the ability of our SPA customers to deliver LNG supplies from the United States, which is primarily dependent upon LNG being a competitive source of energy internationally. The success of our business plan is dependent, in part, on the extent to which LNG can, for significant periods and in significant volumes, be supplied from North America and delivered to international markets at a lower cost than the cost of other alternative energy sources. Through the use of improved exploration technologies, additional sources of natural gas may be discovered outside North America, which could further increase the available supply of natural gas and could result in natural gas being available at a lower cost than LNG exported to these markets.\nPolitical instability in foreign countries that import or export natural gas, or strained relations between such countries and the United States, may also impede the willingness or ability of LNG suppliers and merchants in such countries to import or export LNG from or to the United States. Furthermore, some foreign suppliers of LNG may have economic or other reasons to obtain their LNG from, or direct their LNG to, non-United States markets or from or to our competitors\u2019 LNG facilities in the United States. In addition to natural gas, LNG also competes with other sources of energy, including coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy, which may become available at a lower cost in certain markets.\nAs a result of these and other factors, LNG may not be a competitive source of energy in the United States or internationally. The failure of LNG to be a competitive supply alternative to local natural gas, oil and other alternative energy sources could adversely affect the ability of our customers to deliver LNG from the United States or to the United States on a commercial basis. Any significant impediment to the ability to deliver LNG to or from the United States generally, or to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal or from the SPL Project and the CCL Project specifically, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nVarious economic and political factors could negatively affect the development of LNG facilities, including the SPL Project and the CCL Project, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nCommercial development of an LNG facility takes a number of years, requires a substantial capital investment and may be delayed by factors such as:\n\u2022\nincreased construction costs;\n\u2022\neconomic downturns, increases in interest rates or other events that may affect the availability of sufficient financing for LNG projects on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the price of LNG, which might decrease the expected returns relating to investments in LNG projects;\n\u2022\nthe inability of project owners or operators to obtain governmental approvals to construct or operate LNG facilities;\n\u2022\npolitical unrest or local community resistance to the siting of LNG facilities due to safety, environmental or security concerns; and\n\u2022\nany significant explosion, spill or similar incident involving an LNG facility or LNG vessel.\nThere may be shortages of LNG vessels worldwide, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThe construction and delivery of LNG vessels require significant capital and long construction lead times, and the availability of the vessels could be delayed to the detriment of our LNG business and our customers because of:\n\u2022\nan inadequate number of shipyards constructing LNG vessels and a backlog of orders at these shipyards;\n\u2022\npolitical or economic disturbances in the countries where the vessels are being constructed;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organizations;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages or other labor disturbances at the shipyards;\n\u2022\nbankruptcy or other financial crisis of shipbuilders;\n\u2022\nquality or engineering problems;\n\u2022\nweather interference or a catastrophic event, such as a major earthquake, tsunami or fire; and\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in the receipt of necessary construction materials.\nWe may not be able to secure firm pipeline transportation capacity on economic terms that is sufficient to meet our feed gas transportation requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have contracted for firm capacity for our natural gas feedstock transportation requirements for Trains 1 through 5 of the SPL Project and have an option for firm capacity for Train 6, and partially for the CCL Project. We cannot control the regulatory and permitting approvals or third parties\u2019 construction times. If and when we need to replace one or more of our agreements with these interconnecting pipelines, we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could impair our ability to fulfill our obligations under certain of our SPAs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe face competition based upon the international market price for LNG.\nOur liquefaction projects are subject to the risk of LNG price competition at times when we need to replace any existing SPA, whether due to natural expiration, default or otherwise, or enter into new SPAs. Factors relating to competition may prevent us from entering into a new or replacement SPA on economically comparable terms as existing SPAs, or at all. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects. Factors which may negatively affect potential demand for LNG from our liquefaction projects are diverse and include, among others:\n\u2022\nincreases in worldwide LNG production capacity and availability of LNG for market supply;\n\u2022\nincreases in demand for LNG but at levels below those required to maintain current price equilibrium with respect to supply;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost to supply natural gas feedstock to our liquefaction projects;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the cost of competing sources of natural gas or alternate fuels such as coal, heavy fuel oil and diesel;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the price of non-U.S. LNG, including decreases in price as a result of contracts indexed to lower oil prices;\n\u2022\nincreases in capacity and utilization of nuclear power and related facilities; and\n\u2022\ndisplacement of LNG by pipeline natural gas or alternate fuels in locations where access to these energy sources is not currently available.\nTerrorist attacks, including cyberterrorism, or military campaigns may adversely impact our business.\nA terrorist, including cyberterrorist, or military incident involving an LNG facility, our infrastructure or an LNG vessel may result in delays in, or cancellation of, construction of new LNG facilities, including one or more of the Trains, which would increase our costs and decrease our cash flows. A terrorist incident may also result in temporary or permanent closure of existing LNG facilities, including the Sabine Pass LNG terminal or the Creole Trail Pipeline, which could increase our costs and decrease our cash flows, depending on the duration and timing of the closure. Our operations could also become subject to increased governmental scrutiny that may result in additional security measures at a significant incremental cost to us. In addition, the threat of terrorism and the impact of military campaigns may lead to continued volatility in prices for natural gas that could adversely affect our business and our customers, including their ability to satisfy their obligations to us under our commercial agreements. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, including cyberterrorism, or war could also materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital. The continuation of these developments may subject our construction and our operations to increased risks, as well as increased costs, and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business in General\nWe are subject to significant operating hazards and uninsured risks, one or more of which may create significant liabilities and losses for us.\nThe operation of our LNG terminals and construction of liquefaction facilities are subject to the inherent risks associated with these types of operations, including explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires, hurricanes and adverse weather conditions and other hazards, each of which could result in significant delays in commencement or interruptions of operations and/or in damage to or destruction of our facilities or damage to persons and property. In addition, our operations and the facilities and vessels of third parties on which our operations are dependent face possible risks associated with acts of aggression or terrorism.\nWe do not, nor do we intend to, maintain insurance against all of these risks and losses. We may not be able to maintain desired or required insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nExisting and future environmental and similar laws and governmental regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating costs or construction costs and restrictions.\nOur business is and will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations that regulate and restrict, among other things, discharges to air, land and water, with particular respect to the protection of the environment and natural resources; the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous waste and petroleum products; and remediation associated with the release of hazardous substances. Many of these laws and regulations, such as the CAA, the Oil Pollution Act, the CWA and the RCRA, and analogous state laws and regulations, restrict or prohibit the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with the construction and operation of our facilities, and require us to maintain permits and provide governmental authorities with access to our facilities for inspection and reports related to our compliance. Violation of these laws and regulations could lead to substantial liabilities, fines and penalties or to capital expenditures related to pollution control equipment that could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects. Federal and state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct, for the release of certain types or quantities of hazardous substances into the environment. As the owner and operator of our facilities, we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances released into the environment at or from our facilities and for resulting damage to natural resources.\nThe Obama Administration is pursuing a number of regulatory and policy initiatives to reduce GHG emissions in the United States from a variety of sources. For example, in October 2015, the EPA promulgated a final rule to implement the Obama Administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which is designed to reduce GHG emissions from power plants in the United States. Other federal and state initiatives are being considered or may be considered in the future to address GHG emissions through, for example, United States treaty commitments, direct regulation, a carbon emissions tax, or cap-and-trade programs. Such initiatives could affect the demand for or cost of natural gas, which we consume at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, or could increase compliance costs for our operations.\nOther future legislation and regulations, such as those relating to the transportation and security of LNG imported to or exported from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal through the Sabine-Neches Waterway less than four miles from the Gulf Coast and LNG exported from the Corpus Christi LNG terminal near Corpus Christi, Texas on nearly 2,000 acres of land that we own or control, could cause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in our business and to our proposed construction, the extent of which cannot be predicted and which may require us to limit substantially, delay or cease operations in some circumstances. Revised, reinterpreted or additional laws and regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating or construction costs and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nHealth and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in personal harm or injury, penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements or litigation, and a failure that results in a significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities. Such a failure could generate public concern and have a corresponding impact on our reputation and our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies and local communities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may experience increased labor costs, and the unavailability of skilled workers or our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect us. In addition, changes in our senior management or other key personnel could affect our business results.\nWe are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled employees. We compete with other energy companies and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to construct and operate our facilities and pipelines and to provide our customers with the highest quality service. Our affiliates who hire personnel on our behalf are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and could require an increase in the wage and benefits packages that we offer, thereby increasing our operating costs. Any increase in our operating costs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe depend on our executive officers for various activities. We are currently in a transition process with respect to our Chief Executive Officer, which could affect our strategic direction or our business results. Further, we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our personnel. Although we have arrangements relating to compensation and benefits with certain of our executive officers, we do not have any employment contracts or other agreements with key personnel binding them to provide services for any particular term. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could seriously harm us.\nOur lack of diversification could have an adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nSubstantially all of our anticipated revenue in 2016 will be dependent upon one facility, the Sabine Pass LNG terminal located in southern Louisiana. Due to our lack of asset and geographic diversification, an adverse development at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal or the Corpus Christi LNG terminal, including the related pipelines, or in the LNG industry, would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and operating results than if we maintained more diverse assets and operating areas.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets.\nWe test our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently as circumstances dictate. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including a significant decline in the market price of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows for our business segments or disruptions to our business could lead to an impairment charge of our long-lived assets, including goodwill. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. Projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from results. In addition, if our analysis results in an impairment to our goodwill or long-lived assets, we may be required to record a charge to earnings in\nour Consolidated Financial Statements during a period in which such impairment is determined to exist, which may negatively impact our operating results.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future. Our stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience volatility. For example, between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015, the market price of our common stock ranged between $35.09 and $82.32. Such fluctuations may continue as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide supply of and demand for natural gas and corresponding fluctuations in the price of natural gas;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nissuance of additional equity securities which causes further dilution to stockholders;\n\u2022\nsales of a high volume of shares of our common stock by our stockholders;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nevents affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation or proposals applicable to us;\n\u2022\nactual or potential non-performance by any customer or a counterparty under any agreement;\n\u2022\nannouncements made by us or our competitors of significant contracts;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial or other estimates by analysts; and\n\u2022\nother factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, the United States securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies in these markets. Market fluctuations and broad market, economic and industry factors may negatively affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. If we were to be the object of securities class litigation as a result of volatility in our common stock price or for other reasons, it could result in substantial diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could negatively affect our financial results.\nIf there is a determination that any of the restructuring transactions entered into prior to and in connection with Cheniere Holdings\u2019 initial public offering are taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes and Cheniere Holdings ceases to be a member of our consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we could incur significant income tax liabilities.\nPrior to and in connection with Cheniere Holdings\u2019 initial public offering, we, Cheniere Holdings and other members of our consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes participated in a series of restructuring transactions intended to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service was requested in connection with such restructuring transactions. Under the Internal Revenue Code, Cheniere Holdings will cease to be a member of our consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a deconsolidation) if at any time we own less than 80% of the vote or 80% of the value of Cheniere Holdings\u2019 outstanding shares, whether by issuance of additional shares by Cheniere Holdings or by our sale or other disposition of Cheniere Holdings\u2019 shares. If any of the restructuring transactions is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any reason, following a deconsolidation, we could incur significant income tax liabilities.", "PERMNO": 84723, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "LNG"}
