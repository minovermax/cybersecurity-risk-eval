Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks associated with any one of our businesses, as well as the other risks highlighted elsewhere in this document, particularly the discussions about competition. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks. Note that references to \u201cour\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, etc. used in each risk factor below refers to the business about which such risk factor is provided.\nRisks Related to Straight Path Spectrum\nPlease see the discussion above regarding our status as an Emerging Growth Company.\nThe FCC may cancel or revoke our licenses for certain past or future violations of the FCC\u2019s rules, or for our failure to comply with the Consent Decree, which could limit our operations and growth.\nOur wireless operations and wireless licenses are subject to significant government regulation and oversight, primarily by the FCC and, to a certain extent, by Congress, other federal agencies and state and local authorities. In general, the FCC\u2019s regulations impose potential limits on, among other things, the amount of foreign investment that may be made in some types of FCC licenses, on the transfer or sale of rights in licenses, on the construction and technical aspects of the operation of wireless communication systems, and on the nature of the services that can be provided within a particular frequency band. In addition, we are subject to certain regulatory and other fees levied by the FCC for certain classes of licenses and services. Under some circumstances, our licenses may be canceled or conditioned. We also may be fined for violation of the FCC\u2019s rules, and in extreme cases, our licenses may be revoked.\nAs discussed in this Annual Report, we entered into the Consent Decree with the FCC settling any claims arising from the previously disclosed FCC investigation regarding our spectrum licenses and terminating that investigation. If the FCC were to conclude that we have not complied with the Consent Decree or its rules, it may impose additional fines and/or additional reporting or operational requirements, condition or revoke our remaining spectrum licenses, or take other action. If the FCC were to revoke a significant portion of our remaining spectrum licenses or impose material conditions on the use of our licenses, it could have a material adverse effect on the value of our spectrum licenses and our ability to generate revenues from utilization or sale of our spectrum assets.\nThere are risks and uncertainties associated with the Verizon Merger Agreement.\nThere are risks and uncertainties associated with our proposed Merger with Verizon. For example, the Merger may not be consummated, or may not be consummated as currently anticipated as a result of various factors, including but not limited to the failure to satisfy the closing conditions set forth in the Verizon Merger Agreement.\nThe Verizon Merger Agreement also restricts us from engaging in certain actions and taking certain actions without Verizon\u2019s approval, which could prevent us from pursuing opportunities that may arise prior to the closing of the acquisition.\nThe Verizon Merger Agreement and the Consent Decree with the FCC subject us to restrictions on our business activities.\nThe Verizon Merger Agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities and generally obligates us to generally operate our businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position and even may make it difficult or impossible to relaunch our operations in the event the Verizon Merger Agreement is terminated. Moreover, the Consent Decree with the FCC also bars us from entering into any new leases of its spectrum, which will limit our ability to increase our leasing revenue in the future in the event the Verizon Merger Agreement is terminated.\nUnder the terms of the Consent Decree, we are unable to enter into new leases of our spectrum, which could limit our operations and growth.\nThe Consent Decree prohibits us from entering into new leases for our spectrum licenses and as a result will likely have a material adverse effect on our revenue related to our spectrum assets as leases expire or lessees terminate leases. If we are unable to overcome this obstacle, our business may never develop and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to the conditions contained in the Verizon Merger Agreement, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not be completed.\nOur obligations and the obligations of Verizon to complete the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the receipt of various regulatory approvals. For a more complete summary of the required regulatory approvals and the conditions to the completion of the Merger, please review the Verizon Merger Agreement in its entirety, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on May 11, 2017.\nMany of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to February 12, 2018, which date will automatically be extended another one hundred and eighty (180) days under certain circumstances, it is possible that the Verizon Merger Agreement will be terminated. Although we and Verizon have agreed in the Verizon Merger Agreement to use reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to satisfy certain of the conditions to the Merger, these and other conditions to the completion of the Merger may not be satisfied. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or that the Merger will be completed. See the risk factor below titled \u201cFailure to complete the Merger could negatively affect our stock price and our future business and financial results.\u201d\nIn order to complete the Merger, Verizon and the Company must obtain certain governmental approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions, completion of the Merger may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the Merger could be reduced.\nAlthough Verizon and the Company have agreed in the Verizon Merger Agreement to use their reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings and obtain the required governmental approvals, including receipt of all necessary consents from the FCC (the \u201cFCC consent\u201d), there can be no assurance that the relevant approvals will be obtained. In addition, the governmental authority that provides these approvals has broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. As a condition to approving the Merger or related transactions, the governmental authority may impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of Verizon\u2019s business after completion of the Merger. To the extent necessary to obtain the FCC consent and any other consent from any governmental entity required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Verizon Merger Agreement, Verizon has agreed to take certain specified actions involving Verizon and its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation after the closing date of the Merger) and the Company and its subsidiaries, which include disposing of, divesting, transferring or licensing certain spectrum and related assets, and Verizon and its subsidiaries will take other actions that are in the aggregate de minimis. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, Verizon\u2019s and the Company\u2019s respective obligations to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to complete the Merger do not require Verizon and its affiliates and subsidiaries (including Straight Path and its subsidiaries following the effective time) to consent to an Adverse Regulatory Condition (as defined in the Verizon Merger Agreement). There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger, or otherwise adversely affecting, including to a material extent, Verizon\u2019s businesses and results of operations after completion of the Merger. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the abandonment of the Merger.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact our ability to comply with the Consent Decree with the FCC.\nAs previously disclosed, we are currently subject to the Consent Decree, pursuant to which we are required to pay $15 million in installments over a nine-month period ending October 12, 2017. In addition, if we do not submit applications to the FCC seeking consent to the sale of our remaining spectrum licenses by January 12, 2018, we will be obligated to pay an additional $85 million to the FCC or surrender our remaining spectrum licenses. We believe that the submission by the Company and Verizon of applications to transfer our spectrum licenses to Verizon satisfies this requirement under the Consent Decree. However, if the Merger is not completed for any reason, there is no guarantee that the FCC would not seek to require us to pay the $85 million penalty or seek the forfeiture of our remaining spectrum licenses. If the penalty is imposed by the FCC, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to pay the additional $85 million or repay the remaining amount due of the $17.5 million loan from the Lenders. A failure by us to comply with these requirements could lead to a default by us under the Consent Decree, loss of our remaining spectrum licenses and will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively affect our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of failing to obtain various regulatory approvals, our ongoing business may be adversely affected, and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, we could be subject to a number of negative consequences, including the following:\n\u25cf we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price;\n\u25cf we may experience negative reactions from our customers and suppliers, or negative publicity generally;\n\u25cf we may experience negative reactions from other potential acquirors which could materially reduce our value;\n\u25cf we may experience negative reactions from our employees and may not be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees;\n\u25cf we will have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant non-recurring costs in connection with the Merger that we may be unable to recover;\n\u25cf the Verizon Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Merger, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of Verizon (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), which may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the Merger that may be beneficial to us; and\n\u25cf matters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may be beneficial to us as an independent company.\nPursuant to the Consent Decree with the FCC, any subsequent sale(s) of our remaining 39 GHz and 28 GHz spectrum licenses would be subject to the requirement to pay the FCC 20% of the proceeds from such the sale(s). In addition, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Verizon Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, any of these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nOur FCC licenses are subject to renewal and substantial service requirements. If any licenses are not renewed upon expiration, that could limit the expansion of our business and our ability to lease spectrum and market services provided over our licenses, and could harm our operating results.\nOur spectrum licenses in the LMDS and 39 GHz bands are granted for ten-year terms. Currently, renewal dates for our LMDS A licenses are in August and September 2018 (except our BTA license for the LMDS A1 band that covers parts of the New York City BTA, which was recently renewed until February 1, 2026), and renewal dates for our 39 GHz licenses are currently in October 2020. On August 3, 2017, the FCC adopted new rules governing the process by which licensees may seek renewal of their authorizations. However, for the licenses we hold, those rules do not go into effect until January 1, 2023, after all of licenses will be renewed. A \u201csubstantial service\u201d requirement applies to each of these licenses. The UMFU Report and Order provides that licensees in the 28 GHz A1 band (27.5 - 28.35 GHz) and 39 GHz bands will not be required to fulfill the performance requirements for their respective licenses until June 1, 2024. It is likely that the FCC will issue new licenses for the LMDS A1 spectrum on the one hand and the LMDS A2 and A3 spectrum on the other, with separate renewal and substantial service deadlines for each (as noted above, the substantial service demonstrations dates for the A1 licenses will be June 1, 2024). The FCC\u2019s prior \u201csubstantial service\u201d requirements for both LMDS and 39 GHz licensees provided licensees with flexibility in constructing their licenses while the \u201csafe harbor\u201d guidelines provided licensees with a degree of certainty as to how to comply with the requirements. The build-out requirements in the UMFU Report and Order do not generally contain that flexibility, with specific requirements for fixed and mobile services. We do not know how the FCC will apply these requirements. If the FCC finds that a licensee has failed to meet these new build-out requirements for any license, that authorization could be terminated.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, we may never develop a significant market for leases, licenses, or purchases of our spectrum assets, and we may not obtain meaningful revenues or achieve profitability.\nOur spectrum holdings are among our core assets. A substantial market for our spectrum licenses may never develop and the prospects for that market may be adversely affected by the following:\n\u25cf 5G networks may not be developed;\n\u25cf 5G networks may not utilize 28 GHz or 39 GHz spectrum;\n\u25cf 5G standards may inhibit interest and/or investment in our holdings;\n\u25cf the anticipated demand for fixed services may not materialize;\n\u25cf the fixed services market may be dominated by unlicensed band wireless backhaul options;\n\u25cf the fixed services market may be dominated by fiber solutions not requiring any wireless spectrum;\n\u25cf the technology we have invested in may not be completed or permitted for use by the FCC;\n\u25cf the market for the technology we have invested in may decrease or not materialize;\n\u25cf the macro network may not use 28 GHz or 39 GHz spectrum or very little of it;\n\u25cf new wireless technologies that provide enough capability in existing microwave bands, available at low cost from the FCC, may be sufficient for wireless backhaul and other fixed wireless needs;\n\u25cf front haul solutions including Common Public Radio Interface or remote radio head backhaul may not use 28 GHz or 39 GHz spectrum, instead preferring fiber, other microwave channels, or unlicensed band spectrum;\n\u25cf networks may require non line-of-sight spectrum;\n\u25cf FCC regulatory impact;\n\u25cf new spectrum allocation by the FCC, thereby increasing competition and/or supply;\n\u25cf lack of available equipment for our band from manufacturers;\n\u25cf cost of site acquisition; and\n\u25cf small cell networks may not be developed.\nIf we are unable to overcome these (and potentially other) obstacles, our business may never develop and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, even if a market develops, we may be unable to successfully execute any of our currently identified business opportunities or future business opportunities that we determine to pursue.\nIn order to pursue business opportunities, we will need to forge market alliances with hardware developers and system integrators, as well as maintain the integrity of our spectrum. Our ability to do any of these successfully could be affected by one or more of the following factors:\n\u25cf our ability to effectively manage our third-party relationships;\n\u25cf our ability to manage the expansion of our operations, which could result in increased costs, high employee turnover, or damage to customer relationships;\n\u25cf our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, which may be affected by the significant competition in our industry for persons experienced in network operations and engineering;\n\u25cf equipment failure (not provided by us) or interruption of service, which could adversely affect our reputation and our relations with our customers;\n\u25cf our ability to respond to regulatory or policy changes and/or requirements in our industry;\n\u25cf our ability to accurately predict and respond to the rapid technological changes in our industry and the evolving demands of the markets we serve; and\n\u25cf our ability to raise substantial additional capital to fund our growth.\nOur failure to adequately address one or more of the above factors could have a significant impact on our ability to implement our business plan with respect to mobile backhaul and fiber network extensions and our ability to pursue other opportunities that arise, which might negatively affect our business.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, the success of our business strategy will rely on the continued growth in demand for high volume of data for mobile and home use.\nThe demand for spectrum depends on the continued growth in demand for high volume of data for mobile and home use. The provision of mobile use is a continually evolving sector of the telecommunications industry, and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf the continued development and market acceptance of mobile devices enabled for mobile applications;\n\u25cf the continued development and use of high-bandwidth mobile applications;\n\u25cf historical perceptions regarding the burdens and unreliability of previous mobile wireless technologies;\n\u25cf high rates of consumer adoption of mobile applications;\n\u25cf increased levels of usage by subscribers;\n\u25cf increased or burdensome government presence through policy and regulatory changes;\n\u25cf increases in the number of overall subscribers; and\n\u25cf the continued development of 5G technology and regulations allowing for mobility in our band(s).\nIf the Merger is not consummated, our revenues will depend on the lease of fixed services to wireless service providers.\nOur current revenues are derived from the lease of fixed services to wireless service providers. Any competitor\u2019s substitute service with similar performance and coverage characteristics and a lower cost structure could create downward price pressure and adversely affect our sales efforts. In addition, competing technologies could be developed that would make our services obsolete. Accordingly, any changes that could decrease demand for our services, whether due to pricing pressure, technological changes, or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, our plan to grow revenues from 5G mobile services is highly speculative.\nWe plan to derive a substantial portion of our future revenues from the use of our 28 GHz and/or 39 GHz spectrum in as yet undeveloped 5G mobile networks. Such 5G networks may never be developed or put to commercial use. Even if they are developed and put to commercial use, our spectrum might not be used in such networks. In addition, even if our spectrum can be used in such networks, it could take many years before that occurs. Regulatory and technology changes could make our spectrum less useful or valuable in such networks, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from our spectrum and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, the value of our FCC licenses could decline, which could materially affect our ability to raise capital, and have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our stock.\nA decline in the value of our FCC licenses could negatively impact our ability to raise capital both privately and in the public markets and could significantly reduce the value of the spectrum assets. The value of any or all of our FCC licenses could decrease as a result of many factors, including:\n\u25cf increases in supply of spectrum that provides similar functionality;\n\u25cf new wireless technology in unlicensed bands that provides the same capability of our network;\n\u25cf a decrease in the demand for services offered with any of our FCC licenses;\n\u25cf lower values placed on similar licenses in future FCC auctions;\n\u25cf regulatory limitations on the use, leases, transfer, or sale of rights in any of our FCC licenses;\n\u25cf removal or conditioning of our licenses;\n\u25cf increase in cost or requirements for maintaining licenses; or\n\u25cf bankruptcy or liquidation of any comparable companies.\nMany of these factors depend on circumstances beyond our control. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues and on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe telecommunications and wireless markets are highly competitive, and if the Merger is not consummated, we may be unable to compete effectively, especially against competitors with greater financial and other resources, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate effectively.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to compete successfully. We expect to compete with new providers and technologies not yet introduced. Given the intense competition, we may be unable to compete effectively with other technologies and spectrum holders in the short-term and, consequently, we may be unable to develop our business objectives.\nMany of our competitors, particularly wireless carriers, are much larger and have significantly greater financial resources and experience than us. If we are unable to compete effectively against existing and future competitors our business will be harmed.\nOne of our competitive advantages is our national coverage, and particularly, the extensive bandwidth we are able to offer to customers in congested metropolitan areas. If competitors are able to offer a solution without any significant coverage exceptions, it could mitigate one of our competitive advantages and harm the attractiveness of our offering, which could have a material adverse impact on our sales.\nMany of our competitors offer other telecommunications and wireless solutions to complement their spectrum leasing and sales activities. Since we currently offer only spectrum sales and leasing services, we may not be able to compete with such competitors.\nAdditional spectrum may become available from the FCC in the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued on July 14, 2016 or in other proceedings, increasing the number of or viability of our competitors or even allowing potential buyers to obtain their own spectrum outright, reducing their need to obtain spectrum from us.\nOther entities may obtain FCC licenses to operate spectrum in the same markets as we do, offering similar throughput capacities with comparable transmission reliability. These entities may decide to enter our business and may have more spectrum available to use in a given market than we do. If the FCC decides in the future to allocate and allow use of additional spectrum in the high frequency bands to fixed and/or mobile services, the successful auction of that spectrum could increase the number of entities that hold this spectrum, and its general availability could have a material adverse effect on the value of our spectrum. Companies that would otherwise use our services could instead decide to acquire spectrum rights in these auctions or obtain services from the winners of those auctions. Unsuccessful auctions of spectrum may generate low winning bids and could therefore reduce the values of spectrum in neighboring bands, including the value of our spectrum licenses. Alternatively, the FCC may decide to allocate additional spectrum for licensing without auctions to certain classes of users, such as state and local government agencies, that otherwise might be potential customers of our services. On July 14, 2016, the FCC issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that potentially allocates up to 17.7 GHz of spectrum for flexible fixed or mobile usage.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, we may need to protect incumbent operations.\nPrior to adopting service rules for the 39 GHz spectrum distributed by auction, the FCC permitted licensees to define their own service areas. Applicants for licenses provided the latitude and longitude points for the boundaries of their desired service area, thereby creating service areas generally rectangular in shape - rectangular service areas (\u201cRSAs\u201d). Auction license winners like us are required to protect, and not cause harmful interference to, RSA licensees. There are RSA licenses that are not owned by us within some of our 39 GHz licenses which may deprive us of the full use of our spectrum in those affected areas.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, we anticipate a lengthy sales cycle, which could make our revenues difficult to forecast and cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nWe anticipate that our sales cycle will be lengthy due to the time often necessary for customized design of specific solutions or the possibility that our customers may incur added recurring costs for our products and service offerings or added one-time costs to replace their current telecommunications systems. Our sales cycles will be subject to a number of significant delays over which we have little or no control. Due to our anticipated lengthy sales cycle, we expect that our revenues will be difficult to forecast and may fall short of expectations.\nBecause we are thinly staffed and highly dependent on a limited number of management persons, if the Merger is not consummated, we may not be able to pursue longer term business opportunities, which could limit our revenue growth. Given our short operating history and limited experience, we may not be able to scale our operations, if necessary, to meet market demand and/or regulatory build-out deadlines.\nAs of October 10, 2017, we had nine employees who work directly for us. We have historically relied on third parties for services and support. Our ability to find and respond to opportunities to deliver our services in a cost-effective manner may be limited by the number of personnel we employ and our lack of capital and other operational resources. Even if we are able to identify customers to whom we can provide services, we may have to hire additional personnel without whom we may only be able to provide limited support for those services. This could result in customer dissatisfaction and loss. Additionally, our competitors, many of whom have significantly more personnel and greater resources, may be better able to seek and respond to opportunities than we can. Given our small number of employees, short operating history, and limited experience, we may not be able to scale our operations, if necessary, to meet market demand and/or regulatory build-out deadlines. This could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues and on our business, growth, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of Straight Path Spectrum\u2019s historical revenues were derived from a limited number of customers, and the loss of those customers would have a negative effect on our revenues.\nThe loss of any of our customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe extensive and continually evolving regulations to which we are subject could increase our costs and adversely affect our ability to implement our business plan successfully if the Merger is not consummated.\nThe FCC, various state regulatory bodies, local zoning authorities, and other governmental entities regulate us and the operation and installation of underlying equipment. These regulators conduct regular rulemaking proceedings and issue interpretations of existing rules that apply to us and affect our business operations, directly or indirectly. The FCC in particular imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how wireless spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to our wireless licenses and operations could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. Such regulatory proceedings could impose additional obligations on us or our customers, reduce the attractiveness of our service, give rights to our competitors, increase our costs, make the business plans of the carriers or other customers that purchase or may purchase our services less viable, and otherwise adversely affect our ability to implement our business plan.\nWe could be harmed by network disruptions, security breaches, or other significant disruptions or failures of our IT infrastructure and related systems.\nTo be successful, we need to continue to have available a high capacity, reliable and secure network. We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach, whether through cyber-attack, malware, computer viruses, sabotage, or other significant disruption of our IT infrastructure and related systems. We face a risk of a security breach or disruption from unauthorized access to our proprietary or classified information on our systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of our information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit our information, or those of service providers or business partners, may be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third party service provider or business partner. As a result, our information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without our consent.\nAlthough we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and systems, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging, especially in light of the growing sophistication of cyber-attacks and intrusions. We may be unable to anticipate all potential types of attacks or intrusions or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures.\nNetwork disruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described systems could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems, and therefore, our operations; (ii) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of our proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; (iii) require significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the damages that result or to change our systems; or (iv) result in a loss of business, damage our reputation or expose us to litigation. Any or all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe wireless communications services industry in which we operate is continually evolving. Our services may become obsolete, and we may not be able to develop competitive products or services on a timely basis or at all if the Merger is not consummated.\nThe wireless communications services industry is characterized by rapid technological change, competitive pricing, frequent new service introductions, and evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements. The backhaul infrastructure that supports this dynamic industry must be similarly flexible and able to adapt to these changes. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these challenges and to offer competitive services on a timely basis. We face a number of difficulties and uncertainties associated with this reliance on technological development, such as:\n\u25cf competition from service providers using other means to deliver similar or alternative services;\n\u25cf competition from new service providers using more efficient, less expensive technologies, including products or services not yet invented or developed;\n\u25cf customers self-provisioning their own services;\n\u25cf gaining and sustaining market acceptance of the technology underlying our services;\n\u25cf realizing economies of scale;\n\u25cf responding successfully to advances in competing technologies in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u25cf existing, proposed, or undeveloped technologies that may render fixed wireless backhaul and other services less profitable or obsolete; and\n\u25cf increase in costs or requirements to maintain licenses.\nAs the services offered by us and our competitors develop, wireless carriers may not accept our services as a commercially viable alternative to other means of delivering wireless backhaul and other services. Accordingly, our inability to keep pace with technological development could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur reliance upon spectrum licensed by the FCC includes additional risks.\nOur reliance on and use of FCC-licensed spectrum imposes additional risks on our business, including:\n\u25cf increases in spectrum acquisition costs;\n\u25cf adverse changes to regulations governing spectrum/licensee rights;\n\u25cf the risk that spectrum will not be commercially usable or free of harmful interference from licensed or unlicensed operators in our or adjacent bands;\n\u25cf the risk that the government or other license holders introduce an oversupply of substantially similar spectrum into the market;\n\u25cf the risk that competitors, customers, or other users may over utilize line-of-sight licensed spectrum and thus alter the FCC availability or allocation of such wireless spectrum in markets or geographic areas where we require it;\n\u25cf change in the FCC rules regarding the licensing or use of wireless spectrum; and\n\u25cf invalidation of any authorization to use all or a significant portion of the spectrum, resulting in, among other things, impairment charges related to assets recorded for such spectrum.\nRisks Related to Straight Path IP Group\nThe Settlement of Claims with IDT and sale of Straight Path IP Group may not be consummated.\nAs discussed above, on April 9, 2017, we and IDT entered into the IDT Term Sheet to settle potential claims related to certain claims under agreements related to the Spin-Off, and the sale of our interest in Straight Path IP Group to IDT. Among other things, (i) IDT will pay us $16 million; (ii) we will transfer to IDT our ownership interest in Straight Path IP Group; and (iii) our stockholders will receive 22 percent of net proceeds, if any, received by Straight Path IP Group from any license, and certain transfers or assignments of any of the patent rights held by Straight Path IP Group (\u201ccurrent patent portfolio\u201d), or any settlement, award or judgment involving any of the patent rights (including any net proceeds received after the closing of the Merger).\nThe transactions contemplated by the IDT Term Sheet may never be consummated. If the transactions are not consummated, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to pay the balance on the loan from the Lenders, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and financial condition.\nThere is no assurance that stockholders will receive any monetary benefit from their beneficial interest in the trust that will hold an interest in the current patent portfolio.\nThe IDT Term Sheet contemplates that a trust will be created for the purpose of holding an interest in the current patent portfolio. Such interest will entitle the trust to distributions equal to 22% of any net recovery from the portfolio. Our stockholders, as designated beneficiaries of the trust, will share in any such distributions on a pro rata basis. Any such payments made to the stockholders, as beneficiaries of the trust, will be dependent upon Straight Path IP Group\u2019s ability to successfully prosecute or enforce the patents in the current patent portfolio. Stockholders and the trust will not directly control or hold the patents in the current patent portfolio and will have no control over the strategy or actions regarding patent enforcement and prosecution of the patents in the portfolio. There can be no assurance of the amount, if any, of net recovery that Straight Path IP Group will be able to obtain from the current patent portfolio. In addition, the beneficial interests in the trust will not be securities nor tradeable interests and will not be listed on any securities exchange. Stockholders will not be able to sell, assign, transfer or pledge their beneficial interest in the trust, except under limited circumstances. Consequently, the monetary benefit stockholders will receive from the trust, if any, will be dependent upon the net recovery from the current patent portfolio.\nWe may fail to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain adequate protections, or are unsuccessful in enforcing our patent rights, we may not be able to either realize additional value from our patents, or prevent third parties from benefiting from those patents without benefit to us. In addition, our existing patents have finite lives, and have all expired. Although Straight Path IP Group may continue to enforce the patents for patent infringement that occurred before expiration, we do not anticipate filing additional actions. There is no guarantee that the patents will be adequately exploited or commercialized, and there is no guarantee that there will ever be any net proceeds distributed to our stockholders.\nThe USPTO may grant a re-examination of our patents.\nIn 2010 and 2011, certain patents in Straight Path IP Group\u2019s portfolio successfully emerged from re-examination proceedings at the USPTO. Nevertheless, our patents may be subject to further requests to the USPTO to reexamine our patents. Although we believe that our patents are valid, they may be deemed invalid during a re-examination. Moreover, any litigation filed after the grant of a re-examination may be subject to an order to stay the litigation while the re-examination proceeds. Therefore, while a re-examination is pending, we may be unable to enforce our patents. Similarly, if claims are invalidated through IPR (or re-exam or a different litigation), active cases may be stayed during appeal, and the court may dismiss the case based on a finding of invalidity in another forum.\nThe USPTO may grant an IPR.\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (\u201cAIA\u201d) created a new procedure for challenging an issued patent at the PTAB of the USPTO: the IPR. A petitioner challenging a patent must allege \u201cthat there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner would prevail with respect to at least one of the claims challenged in the petition.\u201d (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 314(a)). As discussed in the Legal Proceedings section below, various parties, including some of the defendants in actions we brought to enforce our patent rights, filed petitions for IPRs at the PTAB for certain claims of our patents. Although the PTAB has denied all of those petitions and those denials have been affirmed on appeal, additional IPR\u2019s might be filed that could curtail our ability to enforce our patent rights during the pendency of any IPR proceeding, and could result in the invalidation of some or all of our patents.\nOur exposure to uncontrollable outside influences, including new legislation, court rulings, or actions by the USPTO, could adversely affect our licensing and enforcement business and results of operations.\nOur licensing and enforcement business is subject to numerous risks from outside influences, including the following:\nNew legislation, regulations, or court rulings related to enforcing patents could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nStraight Path IP Group has spent, and plans to spend, a significant amount of resources to enforce our rights. If new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the USPTO, or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our expenses and revenue. Recently, U.S. patent laws were amended with the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the AIA, which took effect on September 16, 2012. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the AIA changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual parties allegedly infringing by their respective individual actions or activities. As well, the AIA introduced new post grant proceedings, namely IPRs, to allow a third party to challenge the validity of patent claims. The AIA and its implementation has increased the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) has conducted reviews to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could impact the ability to effectively license and enforce patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies.\nFurther, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions.\nFinally, political leaders have recently made statements related to regulation of patent enforcement entities. Any such legislation that materially restricts our enforcement activities could have a negative impact on our ability to execute on Straight Path IP Group\u2019s business plan, the value of our patents, and our operating results.\nTrial judges and juries often find it difficult to understand complex patent enforcement litigation, and as a result, we may need to appeal adverse decisions by lower courts in order to successfully enforce our patents.\nIt is difficult to predict the outcome of patent enforcement litigation at the trial level. It is often difficult for juries and trial judges to understand complex patented technologies, and as a result, there is a higher rate of successful appeals in patent enforcement litigation than other business litigation. Such appeals are expensive and time consuming, resulting in increased costs and delayed revenue. Although we diligently pursue enforcement litigation, we cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions made by juries and trial courts.\nFederal courts are becoming more crowded, and as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer.\nFederal trial courts that hear our patent enforcement actions also hear criminal cases. Criminal cases always take priority over patent enforcement actions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete an enforcement action. Moreover, we believe there is a trend in increasing numbers of civil lawsuits and criminal proceedings before federal judges, and as a result, we believe that the risk of delays in our patent enforcement actions will have a greater effect on our business in the future unless this trend changes.\nAs patent enforcement litigation becomes more prevalent, it may become more difficult for us to voluntarily license our patents.\nThe more prevalent patent enforcement actions become, the more difficult it will be for us to voluntarily license our patents. As a result, we may need to increase the number of our patent enforcement actions to cause infringing companies to license the patent or pay damages for lost royalties.\nAny litigation to protect our intellectual property or any third-party claims to invalidate our patents could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIt may be necessary for us to commence patent litigation against third parties whom we believe require a license to our patents. We may incur significant expenses and commit significant management time with respect to such legal proceedings which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in any additional legal proceedings and the outcome of such litigation could be harmful to us. In addition, we may be subject to claims seeking to invalidate our patents, as typically asserted by defendants in patent litigation. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing and validating our patents and/or if third parties making claims against us seeking to invalidate our patents are successful, they may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which effectively could block our ability to license or otherwise capitalize on our proprietary technologies. In addition, then existing licensees of our patents may no longer be obligated to pay royalties to us. Successful litigation against us resulting in a determination that our patents are not valid or enforceable, and/or that third parties do not infringe, may have a material adverse effect on us. Further, the courts have discretion to award reasonable attorney fees for \u201cexceptional\u201d cases lacking merit or for being unreasonably litigated.\nWe may require additional financing in the future, which may not be available, or may not be available on favorable terms.\nWe may need additional funds to finance our operations to make additional investments, or to acquire complementary businesses or assets. We may be unable to generate these funds from our operations. Additionally, we may experience delays in collecting judgments if defendants decide to appeal jury findings of infringement at federal district courts. We may incur out-of-pocket costs related to our IP enforcement and such expenses could be material and beyond our means. In addition, as we focus our resources on the Straight Path Spectrum and Straight Path Ventures businesses, we may require additional financing from other sources to fund ongoing infringement litigation, which may not be available.\nThe availability of new technology may render our intellectual property obsolete.\nWhile we anticipate that our technology will remain relevant to internet telephony and other applications at least through the expiration of our patents, unanticipated rapid widespread adoption of new technologies that do not infringe our patents could affect our enforcement strategy. In addition, prospective licensees may seek to develop \u2018work arounds\u2019 to our patents for purposes of avoiding entering into a licensing agreement with Straight Path IP Group.\nRisks Related to Straight Path Ventures\nOur technology research and development efforts may be unsuccessful.\nOur technology research and development efforts are exploratory in nature and are intended to develop new types of products. Our efforts may prove unsuccessful and may not result in the development of any products. Even if we are able to develop any products, we may not be able to generate revenues or profits from such products.\nWe may fail to obtain patent protection for our inventions.\nIf we are not able to protect our proprietary technology, trade secrets, and know-how, our competitors may use our inventions to develop competing products. The standards which the USPTO uses to grant patents, and the standards which courts use to interpret patents, are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change, particularly as new technologies develop. Consequently, the level of protection, if any, that will be provided by our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court, is uncertain. In addition, the type and extent of patent claims that will be issued to us in the future is uncertain. Any patents which are issued may not contain claims which will permit us to stop competitors from using similar technology.\nIn addition to any patented technology, we may also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. We may not be able to effectively protect our rights to this technology or information. Other parties may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We generally require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. However, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our technology or information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, we may be unable to realize any revenue from our inventions.\nOur business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties to which companies with new and rapidly evolving technology, products and services are exposed. These risks include the following:\n\u25cf we may be unable to develop sources of new revenue or sustainable growth in revenue because our current and anticipated technologies, products and services may be inadequate or may be unable to attract or retain customers;\n\u25cf intense competition and rapid technological change could adversely affect the market\u2019s acceptance of our existing and new products and services; and\n\u25cf we may be required to incur unanticipated expenditures if product changes or improvements are required. Moreover, new industry standards might redefine the products that we are able to sell, especially if these products are only in the prototype stage of development. If product changes or improvements are required, success in marketing these products by us and achieving or sustaining profitability from these products could be delayed or halted.\nRisk Factors Generally Relating to Us and Our Common Stock\nInvestors may suffer dilution.\nWe may engage in equity financing to fund our future operations and growth. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest (both with respect to the percentage of total securities held, and with respect to the book value of their securities) and such securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock. Moreover, we have in the past and may in the future take actions that dilute our interests (and thus our stockholders\u2019 interest) in certain of our subsidiaries.\nWe are controlled by our principal stockholder, which limits our ability of other stockholders to affect our management.\nAll of the SPCI Class A Common Stock distributed in the Spin-Off are held in trust with an independent trustee, the Alliance Trust Company LLC (the \u201cTrustee\u201d). Howard Jonas retained the economic benefit of the shares placed in the trust, but does not have voting or dispositive power or control with respect to such shares, except in certain circumstances. As of October 10, 2017, the Trustee has voting power or control over 787,163 shares of our Class A common stock representing approximately 66% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock.\nWe intend to exercise our option for the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption under NYSE American rules with respect to our Nominating Committee.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined in section 801(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide because more than 50% of the combined voting power of all of our outstanding common stock will be beneficially owned by a single stockholder. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we will be exempt from certain NYSE American rules requiring a board of directors with a majority of independent members, a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors and a nominating committee composed entirely of independent directors. These independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet those standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. We intend to apply this \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption for our corporate governance practices with respect to the independence requirements of our Nominating Committee. Accordingly, with respect to our Nominating Committee you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE American, and if we were to apply the controlled company exemption to other independence requirements, you would not have the protection afforded by those requirements either.\nWe have limited resources and could find it difficult to raise additional capital.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in order for stockholders to realize increased value on our securities.\nGiven the current global economy, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary funding on commercially reasonable terms in a timely fashion. Failure to receive such funding could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 14041, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "STRP"}
