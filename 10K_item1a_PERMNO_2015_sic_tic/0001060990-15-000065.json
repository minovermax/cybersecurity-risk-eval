You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 proceedings.\nFor the duration of our Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business plan, and our continuation as a going concern, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan or alternative restructuring transaction, including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain court approval with respect to motions filed in the Chapter 11 proceedings from time to time;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to fund and execute our business plan;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a Chapter 11 plan, to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee, or to convert the Chapter 11 proceedings to a chapter 7 proceeding; and\n\u2022\nthe actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 proceedings that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, we need the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events that occur during our Chapter 11 proceedings will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe it is highly likely that the shares of our existing common stock will be cancelled in our Chapter 11 proceedings.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our existing common stock in our capital structure. As a result, we believe that it is highly likely that the shares of our existing common stock will be cancelled in our Chapter 11 proceedings and will be entitled to a limited recovery, if any. Any trading in shares of our common stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of shares of our common stock.\nOur businesses could suffer from a long and protracted restructuring.\nOur future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a Chapter 11 plan or other alternative restructuring transaction, including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Failure to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan or approval and consummation of an alternative restructuring transaction in a timely manner may harm our ability to obtain financing to fund our operations, and there is a significant risk that the value of our enterprise would be substantially eroded to the detriment of all stakeholders. If a Chapter 11 plan that complies with the application provisions of the Bankruptcy Code cannot be agreed upon, it is possible that we would have to liquidate our assets, in which case it is likely that holders of claims would receive substantially less favorable treatment than they would receive if we were to emerge as a viable, reorganized entity.\nThere can be no assurance as to whether we will successfully reorganize and emerge from the Chapter 11 proceedings or, if we do successfully reorganize, as to when we would emerge from the Chapter 11 proceedings.\nEven after a Chapter 11 plan is confirmed and implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders, suppliers and other third parties to do business with a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy proceedings.\nWe have substantial liquidity needs and may be required to seek additional financing. If we are unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or maintain adequate liquidity, our ability to replace our proved reserves or to maintain current production levels and generate revenue will be limited.\nOur principal sources of liquidity historically have been cash flow from operations, sales of oil and natural gas properties, borrowings under the Combined Credit Agreements, and issuances of debt securities. Our capital program will require additional financing above the level of cash generated by our operations to fund growth. If our cash flow from operations remains depressed or decreases as a result of lower commodity prices or otherwise, our ability to expend the capital necessary to replace our proved reserves, maintain our leasehold acreage or maintain current production may be limited, resulting in decreased production and proved reserves over time. In addition, drilling activity may be directed by our partners in certain areas and we may have to forfeit acreage if we do not have sufficient capital resources to fund our portion of expenses.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have extremely limited, if any, access to additional financing. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for the Chapter 11 proceedings and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11 proceedings. We cannot assure you that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 cases until we are able to emerge from our Chapter 11 proceedings.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any cash collateral order entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 proceedings, (ii) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iii) our ability to generate cash flow from operations, (iv) our ability to develop, confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan or other alternative restructuring transaction, and (v) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 proceedings. Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity depends in part upon industry conditions and general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. In the event that cash on hand and cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may be required to seek additional financing. We can provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available, offered to us on acceptable terms. Our access to additional financing is, and for the foreseeable future will likely continue to be, extremely limited if it is available at all. Our long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nIn certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nIf the Bankruptcy Court finds that it would be in the best interest of creditors and/or the U.S. Debtors, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our Chapter 11 bankruptcy case to a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate the U.S. Debtors\u2019 assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. The U.S. Debtors believe that liquidation under chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to the U.S. Debtors\u2019 creditors than those provided for in a Chapter 11 plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a disorderly fashion over a short period of time rather than reorganizing or selling in a controlled manner the U.S. Debtors\u2019 businesses as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to March 17, 2015 or before confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and/or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the\nterms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged through a plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nOur financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nDuring the Chapter 11 proceedings, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments and may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the bankruptcy filing.\nIn addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical trends.\nTransfers of our equity, or issuances of equity in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings, may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards in future years.\nUnder federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses carried forward from prior years. We have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $810 million as of December 31, 2014. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, then our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Generally, there is an \u201cownership change\u201d if one or more stockholders owning 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over the prior three-year period. Following the implementation a plan of reorganization, it is possible that an \u201cownership change\u201d may be deemed to occur. Under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, absent an applicable exception, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the amount of its net operating losses that may be utilized to offset future taxable income generally is subject to an annual limitation.\nWe could lose all of our equity investment in QRCI and fail to receive any recovery for our intercompany indebtedness with QRCI if QRCI files for creditor protection under the CCAA.\nIf QRCI files for creditor protection under the CCAA, we could potentially lose all of our equity investment in QRCI and QRCI could cease to be our subsidiary. QRCI has a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our existing equity in QRCI, and we believe that it is highly likely that our existing equity in QRCI would be cancelled in any CCAA proceedings. We also have an unsecured intercompany note with QRCI for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $413 million as of December 31, 2014. We believe that we would be entitled to receive our pro rata share of the consideration that would be distributed to unsecured creditors in any CCAA proceedings. However, it is possible that the other stakeholders in the CCAA proceedings could seek to recharacterize our unsecured indebtedness as an equity investment due to the intercompany nature of the indebtedness. If such stakeholders were successful, then we would also be unlikely to receive any recovery for the amount of the indebtedness under the intercompany note since all of the equity in QRCI would likely be cancelled in any CCAA proceedings.\nOur Horn River Asset has the potential for development of significant resources, but is expensive to develop and requires us to attract one or more strategic partners to fully realize its value.\nThe successful development of our Horn River Asset and the proposed liquefaction facility will require significant capital resources and currently exceeds our ability to finance such development. We need to attract and successfully execute one or more transactions involving our Horn River Asset to fully fund the development of these potential resources. If we are unable to successfully execute a transaction involving our Horn River Asset, we may be unable to develop our Horn River Asset to its full resource potential.\nAdditionally, we have minimum gross capital expenditure requirements in our Horn River Asset that if we are unable to meet would result in a substantial cash penalty payable to Fortune Creek. If we are unable to satisfy this obligation through cash payments, KKR has the right to liquidate the partnership and could assert a guarantee claim against us.\nCommodity prices fluctuate widely, and low prices could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue, profitability, and future growth depend in part on prevailing commodity prices. These prices also affect the amount of cash flow available to fund our capital program and our other liquidity needs, as well as our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we can economically produce.\nPrices for our production fluctuate widely, particularly as evidenced by price movements between 2008 and 2014. Factors that can cause these fluctuations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nthe level and locations of domestic and foreign oil and natural gas supplies;\n\u2022\nthe quality, price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nthe quantity of natural gas in storage;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations, including environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nimpact of trade organizations, such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in oil and natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nspeculation by investors in oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\nworldwide economic conditions.\nDue to the volatility of commodity prices and the inability to control the factors that influence them, we cannot predict future pricing levels. A decrease in commodity prices without an offsetting significant increase in production or cash received from our derivatives program could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we routinely sell a portion of our production at monthly fixed index prices. Our ability to continue to enter into monthly fixed index sales agreements may be limited as a result of our counterparties' view of our financial condition, particularly involving our Canadian entity. As such, we may be subject to selling our gas on a daily spot index, which may cause greater volatility in our revenues.\nA decrease in the prices we receive for our production, unsuccessful exploration and development efforts or a substantial increase in our costs, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe employ the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties which, among other things, imposes limits to the capitalized cost of our assets. The capitalized cost cannot exceed the present value of the estimated cash flows from the underlying oil and natural gas reserves discounted at 10%. We could recognize future impairments if the commodity prices utilized in determining proved reserves value cause the value of our proved reserves to decrease. Increased operating and capitalized costs without incremental increases in proved reserve value could also trigger impairment based upon decreased value of our proved reserves. The impairment of our oil and natural gas properties will cause us to reduce their carrying value and recognize non-cash expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have significant exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices since a significant portion of our estimated future production is not covered by commodity derivatives and we may not be able to enter into commodity derivatives covering our estimated future production on favorable terms or at all.\nAs of March 31, 2015, our portfolio of commodity derivatives is only 20 MMcfd through the end of 2015. During the Chapter 11 proceedings, our ability to enter into new commodity derivatives covering additional estimated future production will be dependent upon either entering into unsecured hedges or obtaining Bankruptcy Court approval to enter into secured hedges. As a result, we may not be able to enter into additional commodity derivatives covering our production in future periods on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot or choose not to enter into commodity derivatives in the future, we could be more affected by changes in commodity prices than\nour competitors who engage in hedging arrangements. Our inability to hedge the risk of low commodity prices in the future, on favorable terms or at all, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are able to enter into any commodity derivatives, they may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodity prices. These arrangements would also expose us to risk of financial losses in some circumstances, including the following:\n\u2022\nour production could be materially less than expected; or\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to the contracts could fail to perform their contractual obligations.\nIf our actual production and sales for any period are less than the production covered by any commodity derivatives (including reduced production due to operational delays) or if we are unable to perform our exploration and development activities as planned, we might be required to satisfy a portion of our obligations under those commodity derivatives without the benefit of the cash flow from the sale of that production, which may materially impact our liquidity. Additionally, if market prices for our production exceed collar ceilings or swap prices, we would be required to make monthly cash payments, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity.\nOur proved reserve and production estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate and any material inaccuracies in these estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our proved reserves and our forecasted production.\nThe process of estimating proved reserves and production is complex. In order to prepare these estimates, we and our independent reserve engineers must project future production rates and the timing and amount of future development expenditures and such projections may be inaccurate. We and the engineers must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. In addition to interpreting available technical data, we and the engineers must also analyze other various assumptions and the estimated production. Actual future production, commodity prices, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and our estimated quantities of recoverable proved reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of proved reserves and the estimated production presented in our filings with the SEC. In addition, we may adjust estimates of production and estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing commodity prices and other factors that may be beyond our control.\nWe have proved reserves that are undeveloped. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires additional capital expenditures and successful drilling and completion operations. Our proved reserve estimates assume that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our proved undeveloped and non-producing reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our proved reserves using SEC specifications, actual prices and costs may vary from these estimates, the development of our reserves may not occur as scheduled or actual results of that development may not be as estimated prior to drilling.\nThe present value of future net cash flows disclosed in Item 8 of this Annual Report is not necessarily the fair value of our proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves for 2014 are based upon prices determined on an unweighted average of the preceding 12-month first-day-of-the-month prices adjusted for local differentials and operating and development costs as of period end. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in our estimates, which are calculated in accordance with SEC requirements. Any changes in consumption by natural gas, NGL and oil purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the production and the costs from the development and production of our oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is specified by the SEC for calculating discounted future net cash flows, may not reflect current conditions. The effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general would affect the appropriateness of the 10% discount factor in arriving at the actual fair value of our proved reserves.\nAll of our producing properties and operations are located in a small number of geographic areas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in limited geographic areas.\nOur production is concentrated in three core areas. As a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from these wells caused by transportation capacity constraints,\ncurtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or gas produced from the wells in these areas. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effect of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Canadian operations present unique risks and uncertainties, different from or in addition to those we face in our U.S. operations.\nIn addition to the various risks associated with our U.S. operations, risks associated with our operations in Canada, where we have substantial operations, include, among other things, risks related to increases in taxes and governmental royalties, aboriginal claims, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and compliance with U.S. and Canadian laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. For example, in addition to federal regulation, each province has legislation and regulations which govern land tenure, royalties, production rates and other matters. The royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production. Royalties payable on production from lands other than Crown lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee. Crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production, and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices, well productivity, geographical location, field discovery date and the type or quality of the petroleum product produced. Laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade and taxation may also adversely affect our Canadian operations.\nIn addition, the level of activity in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry is influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Wet weather and spring thaw may make the ground unstable. Consequently, municipalities and provincial transportation departments enforce road bans that restrict the movement of rigs and other heavy equipment, thereby reducing our activity levels. Also, certain of our oil and natural gas producing areas are located in areas that are inaccessible other than during the winter months because the ground surrounding the sites in these areas consists of swampy terrain. Therefore, seasonal factors and unexpected weather patterns may lead to declines in exploration and production activity.\nAboriginal peoples in Canada hold certain constitutionally protected rights pursuant to historic occupation of lands, historic customs and treaties with governments. Such rights may include, among other things, rights to access lands and hunting and fishing rights. The extent and nature of aboriginal rights vary from place to place in Canada, depending on historic and contemporary circumstances. All of our Horn River Asset acreage is located within the Treaty 8 settlement negotiated between the Federal Crown and First Nations and is subject to aboriginal rights associated with traditional use of the lands that could potentially impact our ability to develop and produce our mineral rights. We are not aware that any claims have been made against us in respect of our properties and assets in connection with aboriginal rights; however, if a claim arose and was successful, such claim may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, prior to making decisions that may adversely affect existing or claimed aboriginal rights, governments in Canada have a duty to consult with aboriginal people potentially affected, and in some instances, a duty to accommodate concerns raised through such consultation. Regulatory authorizations for our operations may be affected by the time required for the completion of aboriginal consultation, and operational restrictions imposed by governmental authorities pursuant to such consultation may materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant payments required from us under firm capacity contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUnder contracts with various third parties, we are obligated to provide minimum daily natural gas or NGL volume for gathering, processing, fractionation or transportation, as determined on a monthly basis, or pay for any volume deficiencies at a specified reservation fee rate. In late February 2015, QRCI did not pay an uneconomic Canadian gathering and processing commitment, which included significant unused firm capacity. In early March 2015, the third party service provider issued a demand letter regarding the missed payment and suspended service.\nFurther, a termination notice was issued effective March 19, 2015. Upon termination, the third party drew down C$33 million of an issued letter of credit. We expect that we and the third party will disagree as to what are the remaining obligations under the relevant agreement and the length of the remaining term of the agreement and as to the remedies and defenses available to the parties. While we expect to vigorously dispute the amount, we expect that the third party will claim to be entitled to up to approximately C$126 million (including the proceeds of the letter of credit) as the aggregate of the monthly tolls for firm capacity for the alleged remainder of the term of the relevant agreement.\nWe estimate the expense for unused firm capacity in 2015 due in our Horn River Asset, excluding the terminated contract, could be between $9 million and $12 million, depending on our production levels and our ability to fulfill our commitments through third-party production. If we are unable to satisfy this obligation through cash payments, KKR has the right to liquidate Fortune Creek and could assert a guarantee claim against us.\nOur business involves many hazards and operational risks.\nOur operations are subject to many risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including, but not limited to, operating hazards such as well blowouts, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, injuries to personnel, formations with abnormal pressures, treatment plant \u201cdowntime,\u201d pipeline ruptures or spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, any of which could cause us to experience substantial losses. The occurrence of a significant accident or other event could curtail our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiabilities and expenses not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of operating hazards, regulatory risks and other uninsured risks, we could incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of such risks and losses in accordance with customary industry practice. We are not insured against all incidents, claims or damages that might occur, and pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Any significant accident or event that is not insured at levels that may become payable could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be unable to economically obtain or maintain the insurance that we desire, or may elect not to obtain or renew insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions or our financial outlook, premiums and deductibles for all or some certain of our insurance policies could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only at reduced coverage levels. Any type of catastrophic event that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to replace our proved reserves could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, production and cash flows.\nOil and natural gas proved reserves are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our production decline rates may be significantly higher than currently estimated if our wells do not produce as expected. Further, our decline rate may change when we drill additional wells or make acquisitions or divestitures. Our proved reserves will generally decline as commodity prices decrease and as proved reserves are produced, except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire additional proved reserves. In order to maintain or increase proved reserves and production, we must continue our development drilling or undertake other replacement activities. Our planned exploration and development projects or any acquisition activities that we may undertake might not result in meaningful additional proved reserves, and we might not have continuing success drilling productive wells. Even in the event that our exploration and development projects do result in meaningful additional commercially viable proved reserves, midstream infrastructure for these proved reserves may not exist or may not be constructed, either of which could adversely impact our ability to benefit from those proved reserves. If our exploration and development efforts are unsuccessful, our leases covering acreage that is not already held by production could expire. If they do expire and if we are unable to renew the leases on acceptable terms, we will lose the right to conduct drilling activities and the resulting economic benefits associated therewith. If we are unable to develop or acquire additional proved reserves to replace our current and future production at economically acceptable terms,\nour business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Further, our limited liquidity has caused us to significantly limit the development of and exploration for additional reserves, and future development and exploration will require continued liquidity. If we divest any of our producing assets, our production and cash flows will be reduced. Drilling may occur at a rate directed by our partners in certain areas and may not be sufficient to grow production or proved reserves.\nWe rely upon the operations of gas gathering, treating, processing, liquids fractionation and transportation facilities we do not own or operate.\nWe deliver our production to market through gathering, treating, fractionation and transportation systems that we do not own or operate. The marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties. A portion of our production could be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of a providers' contractual right to limit or suspend services due to their economic conditions, weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, terrorist activities and other security threats, maintenance of third-party facilities or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities or interstate pipelines to transport our production. Disruption of our production could negatively impact our ability to market, fractionate and deliver our production. Since we do not own or operate these assets, their continuing operation is not within our control. If any of these pipelines and other facilities becomes unavailable or capacity constrained, or if further planned development of such assets is delayed or abandoned, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, QRCI may be unable to secure gas gathering and processing services for its Horn River production following the suspension of service by our previous provider. We are exploring alternatives to gather and process our Horn River Asset production; however, we may not be able to find economic alternatives in the near-term, or at all.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than many of our competitors.\nWe compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for property acquisitions and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate our properties. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, and they may be better able to absorb the burden of drilling and infrastructure costs, implementation of new technologies and any changes in federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, there is substantial competition for investment capital in the oil and natural gas industry. These competitors may be able to pay more for properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than we can. Our ability to explore for oil and natural gas prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to complete transactions in this highly competitive environment. Furthermore, the oil and natural gas industry competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel needs of industrial, commercial and other consumers. Our inability to compete effectively with other oil and natural gas companies could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nDifficulties or delays in obtaining oil field equipment and increases in drilling and other service costs could adversely affect our ability to pursue our drilling program.\nAs commodity prices increase and exploration and development activity increases in established and emerging basins, demand and costs for drilling equipment, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services can increase significantly. We cannot be certain that in a higher commodity price environment we would be able to obtain necessary drilling equipment and supplies in a timely manner, on satisfactory terms or at all, and we could experience difficulty in obtaining, or there may be material increases in the cost of, drilling equipment, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. In addition, drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions, including urban drilling, and possible title issues. As a result of increased activity levels, we have seen increases and supply limitations for the services we procure. Any such shortages or delays and price increases could adversely affect our ability to execute our drilling program.\nOur activities are regulated by complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to various U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial and local government laws and regulations that could change in response to economic or political conditions. Matters that are typically regulated include:\n\u2022\ndischarge permits for drilling and completion operations;\n\u2022\nwater obtained for drilling and completion purposes;\n\u2022\ndrilling permits and bonds;\n\u2022\nreports concerning operations;\n\u2022\nspacing of wells;\n\u2022\noperations and personnel safety;\n\u2022\nwater and waste disposal, including disposal wells;\n\u2022\nwildlife habitat restrictions;\n\u2022\nair emissions limits and permitting;\n\u2022\nhydraulic fracturing chemical disclosures;\n\u2022\nunitization and pooling of properties; and\n\u2022\ntaxation.\nFrom time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, laws, regulations and tax requirements frequently are changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot assure you that existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe benefit from federal income tax provisions with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and those provisions may be limited or repealed by future legislation.\nThe Obama administration's 2015 budget proposes to eliminate certain U.S. federal income tax benefits currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These proposals include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the manufacturing deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. These changes are similar to proposals in prior years that were not enacted into law. It is unclear whether such changes will be enacted or how soon they would be effective if enacted. Enactment of these proposals or other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or defer certain tax credits or deductions that are currently available with respect to our activities, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. See also \u201c-Our activities are regulated by complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\u201d\nWe are subject to environmental laws, regulations and permits, including greenhouse gas requirements, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities and obligations.\nWe are subject to stringent and complex U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws, regulations and permits relating to, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal, gathering, transmission and remediation of natural gas, NGLs, oil and hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of such materials to the ground, air and water; aging equipment; water and wetlands protection; threatened and endangered species protection; the storage, use, treatment and disposal of water, including process water; the placement, operation and reclamation of wells; and the health and safety of our employees. These requirements may impose operational restrictions and remediation obligations, including requirements to close pits. In particular, many of these requirements are intended to help preserve water and wildlife resources and regulate those aspects of our operations that could potentially impact surface water, groundwater or wildlife. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in our being subject to litigation, fines or other sanctions, including the revocation of permits and suspension of operations, and\ncould otherwise delay or impede the issuance or renewal of permits. We expect to continue to incur significant capital and other compliance costs related to such requirements.\nWe could be subject to joint and several strict liability for any environmental contamination at our and our predecessors' currently or formerly owned, leased or operated properties or third-party waste disposal sites. In addition to potentially significant investigation and remediation costs, such matters can give rise to claims from governmental authorities and other third parties for fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage.\nThese laws, regulations and permits, and the enforcement and interpretation thereof, change frequently and generally have become more stringent over time. For example, governmental regulators are becoming increasingly focused on air emissions from our industry. This increased scrutiny has led to heightened enforcement of existing regulations as well as the imposition of new air emission measures, and the EPA plans to propose further expanded requirements to reduce volatile organic compound and methane emissions. With respect to GHG emissions, we are currently required to report annual GHG emissions from certain of our operations, and additional GHG emission related requirements have been implemented or are in various stages of development. Any current or future GHG or other air emission requirements could curtail our operations or otherwise result in operational delays, liabilities and increased compliance costs. In addition, to the extent climate change results in more severe weather, our or our customers' operations may be disrupted, which could curtail our exploration and production activity, increase operating costs and reduce product demand.\nOur costs, liabilities and obligations relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur hydraulic fracturing operations are subject to laws and regulations that could expose us to increased costs and additional operating restrictions and delays, and adversely affect production.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely upon hydraulic fracturing, a practice that involves the pressurized injection of water, chemicals and other substances into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production. Various federal, state, provincial and local initiatives have been implemented or are under development to regulate or further investigate the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing. In particular, the EPA is conducting a study to determine the environmental and health impacts of hydraulic fracturing and has announced that it will propose standards for the treatment or disposal of wastewater from certain gas production operations. In April 2012, the EPA issued new air standards that require measures to reduce volatile organic compound emissions at new hydraulically fractured natural gas wells and existing wells that are re-fractured. Certain municipalities and states and Canadian provinces in which we operate, including Texas, Colorado, British Columbia and Alberta, have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that have imposed, or could impose, more stringent permitting, transparency, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Generally, the jurisdictions in which we operate require public disclosure of chemicals in fluids used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Local ordinances or other regulations also may regulate, restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and hydraulic fracturing in particular. Baseline water sampling and studies are a regulatory requirement in Colorado, British Columbia and Alberta. Such laws and regulations may result in increased scrutiny or third-party claims, or otherwise result in operational delays, liabilities and increased costs.\nHydraulic fracturing can require significant quantities of water. In recent years, Texas and northeastern British Columbia have experienced drought conditions. Any diminished access to water for use in hydraulic fracturing in these or other locations in which we operate, whether due to usage restrictions or drought or other weather conditions, could curtail our operations or otherwise result in operational delays or increased costs. Any current or future federal, state, provincial or local hydraulic fracturing requirements applicable to our operations, or diminished access to water for use in hydraulic fracturing, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nParties with whom we do business may become unable or unwilling to timely perform their obligations to us.\nWe enter into contracts and transactions with various third parties, including contractors, suppliers, customers, lenders, joint venture and other partners, and counterparties to hedging arrangements, under which such third parties incur performance or payment obligations to us. Any delay or failure on the part of one or more of such third parties to perform their obligations to us could, depending upon the nature and magnitude of such failure or failures, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operations of the third parties on whom we rely for gathering and transportation services are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations that require obtaining and maintaining numerous permits, approvals and certifications from various federal, state, provincial and local government authorities. These third parties may incur substantial costs in order to comply with existing laws and regulations. If existing laws and regulations governing such third-party services are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to their operations, these changes may affect the costs that we pay for such services. Similarly, a failure to comply with such laws and regulations by the third parties on whom we rely could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWells that we decide to drill may not meet our pre-drilling expectations, may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities and are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence, timing or success of drilling.\nOur ability to execute our drilling program, including the development of our proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, commodity prices, costs and drilling results. In addition, the cost and timing of drilling, completing, and operating any well are often uncertain, and new wells may not be productive. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells will be applicable to our identified drilling locations. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon-bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce commercially viable quantities of oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. The failure to drill our identified drilling locations on a timely basis or the failure of our wells to yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities could cause a decline in our proved reserves and adversely affect our ability to maintain leases, borrowing capacity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our properties are in areas that may be impacted by offset wells and our wells may be adversely affected by actions other operators may take when operating wells that they own.\nMany of our properties are in areas that may have already been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling. The owners of leasehold interests adjoining any of our properties could take actions, such as drilling additional wells, that could adversely affect our operations. When a new well is completed and produced, the pressure differential in the vicinity of the well causes the migration of reservoir fluids towards the new wellbore (and potentially away from existing wellbores). As a result, the drilling and production of these potential locations could cause a depletion of our proved reserves and may inhibit our ability to further develop our proved reserves. In addition, completion operations and other activities conducted on adjacent or nearby wells could cause production from our wells to be shut in for indefinite periods of time, could result in increased lease operating expense and could adversely affect the production and proved reserves from our wells after they re-commence production. We have no control over the operations or activities of offsetting operators.\nOur Horn River Asset is in the early stages of development.\nOur Horn River Asset is at an early stage of development. As such, there is limited information on reservoir quality which may affect the development schedule and well spacing requirements to fully recover the natural gas reserves. Additionally, the infrastructure is still in development, and while sufficient capacity exists today, future infrastructure development is necessary and could lead to delays or unexpected costs associated with getting our production to market.\nA significant increase in the differential between the NYMEX price or other benchmark prices and the prices we receive for our production could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe prices that we receive for our production often reflect a regional discount, based on the location of production, to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX, that are used for calculating the fair value of our commodity derivatives. Although there has been a demonstrated and consistent basis spread between NYMEX and where we sell our production (such as at Henry Hub, Houston Ship Channel and AECO), any increase in these differentials, if significant, could adversely affect our financial condition. Furthermore, any long-term dislocation of such differentials could materially affect our results of operations and ability to achieve expected results.\nDerivatives regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivatives to reduce the effect of commodity price risk, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nWe use commodity derivatives to manage our commodity price risk. In 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that, among other things, establishes comprehensive federal oversight and regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, termed \u201cswaps\u201d and \u201csecurity-based swaps\u201d by the Dodd-Frank Act, and many of the entities that participate in the swaps markets. The Dodd-Frank Act required the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d), along with certain other regulators, to promulgate final rules and regulations to implement many of its swap regulatory provisions. The SEC was given regulatory authority over security-based swaps. The CFTC was given regulatory authority over swaps, which includes commodity swaps. While the SEC's rules governing security-based swaps have largely not been finalized, the CFTC has implemented the majority of its rules. As a result, the final form and timing of the implementation of the new swap regulatory regime affecting commodity derivatives is largely in effect, subject to the rules discussed below.\nIn particular, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFTC with authority to adopt position limits for swaps. In 2011, the CFTC adopted a swap position limits rule, however, that rule was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under a lawsuit brought by the financial services industry organizations. In November 2013, the CFTC re-proposed position limits rules that, if finalized as proposed, would impose limits on positions in certain physical commodity swaps. While the timing of implementation of final rules on position limits, their applicability to us, and impact on us, remains uncertain, there can be no assurance that, when in place, position limit rules will not have a material adverse impact on us by affecting the prices of or market for commodities relevant to our operations and/or by reducing the availability to us of commodity derivatives.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, through CFTC swap rules, has imposed a number of other new requirements on swap transactions and subjected swap dealers and major swap participants and their counterparties to significant new regulatory requirements, including mandatory clearing and trade execution of certain standardized interest rate and credit default swaps. This has resulted in increased costs and regulatory oversight for us and our swap counterparties. The full impact of this new regulatory regime on the availability, pricing and terms and conditions of commodity derivatives, remains uncertain, but there can be no assurance that it will not have, or continue to have, certain materially adverse effects on our ability to hedge our exposure to commodity prices.\nIn addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, swap dealers and major swap participants will be required to collect initial and variation margin from certain end-users of swaps, though Congress, through the passage of the Business Risk Mitigation and Price Stabilization Act of 2015, amended the Commodity Exchange Act to exclude non-financial end-users, such as us, from margin requirements for uncleared swaps used to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. However, the rules implementing these requirements have not been finalized and therefore the timing of their implementation and their applicability to us remains uncertain. Depending on the final rules and definitions ultimately adopted, we may be required to post collateral for some or all of our derivative transactions, which could cause liquidity issues for us by reducing our ability to use our cash or other assets for capital expenditures or other corporate purposes and reduce our ability to execute strategic hedges to reduce commodity price uncertainty and protect cash flows.\nIf we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulations promulgated under it and the changes to the nature of the derivatives markets, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of commodity prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to natural gas, NGLs and oil. Our revenue could, therefore, be adversely affected if commodity prices were to decrease.\nWe have lost key management personnel and employees and the loss of additional personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations are dependent on a relatively small group of key management personnel, including our executive officers. Our recent liquidity issues and our Chapter 11 proceedings have created distractions and uncertainty for our key management personnel and our employees. As a result, we have experienced and may continue to experience increased levels of employee attrition. Because competition for experienced personnel in our industry can be intense, we may be unable to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and\nexperience and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. In addition, a loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale, at the corporate and field levels, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer and counterparty expectations, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nOur common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange and is quoted only in over-the-counter markets, which carries substantial risks and could continue to negatively impact our stock price, volatility and liquidity.\nOur common stock was previously listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cKWK.\u201d The NYSE placed a trading halt on our common stock in light of its abnormally low trading price and suspended our listing before the opening of the market on January 8, 2015. Our common stock is now quoted on the OTC Pink under the symbol \u201cKWKAQ.\u201d\nSecurities traded in over-the-counter markets such as the OTC Pink generally have substantially less volume and liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange such as the NYSE as a result of various factors, including the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, fewer market makers in the securities, and a reduction in securities analyst and news media coverage. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may have difficulty selling their shares and our stock price could experience additional downward pressure. Furthermore, the price of our common stock could be subject to greater volatility and could be more likely to be affected by market conditions and fluctuations, changes in our operating results, market perception of us and our business, developments regarding our restructuring, and announcements by us or other parties with an interest in our business or restructuring.\nWe may be subject to additional compliance requirements under applicable state laws in connection with the issuance of our securities. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future.\nIf we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be subject enforcement action by the Securities and Exchange Commission or we could incur liability to our stockholders.\nFailure to remain current in our reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 could also subject us to enforcement action by the Securities and Exchange Commission or private rights of action by our stockholders.\nA small number of existing stockholders exercise significant control over our company, which could limit other stockholders' ability to influence the outcome of stockholder votes.\nAs of March 17, 2015, members of the Darden family, together with entities controlled by them, beneficially owned approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, they are generally able to significantly affect the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our charter or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, restated bylaws and stockholder rights plan contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control without our board of directors' approval.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control without our board of directors' approval. In this regard:\n\u2022\nour board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nour board of directors is classified; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice is required for director nominations by stockholders and actions to be taken at annual meetings at the request of stockholders.\nIn addition, we have amended and extended a stockholder rights plan, which could also impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, even if that change of control might be beneficial to stockholders, thus increasing the likelihood that incumbent directors will retain their positions. In certain circumstances, the fact that corporate devices are in place that will inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock.\nThere are inherent limitations in all internal control over financial reporting systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWhile we have taken actions designed to address compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, there are inherent limitations in our ability to comply with these requirements. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.", "PERMNO": 86759, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "KWKAQ"}
