The Company\u2019s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves. Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the Company\u2019s equipment and services. The yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the Company serves, which are principally North America and Europe. Demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the Company or its competitors.\nCompetition and Prices. The Company operates in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales and pricing. Financial results depend largely on the ability to develop, manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand.\nProduction Costs, Capacity and Inflation. The Company\u2019s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. Commodity or component price increases, cost pressures due to inflation, significant shortages of component products and labor availability may adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial results or use of its production capacity. Many of the Company\u2019s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers, and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the Company. Supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers\u2019 products exceeds their production capacity. Unexpected events, including natural disasters, extreme weather events, or global pandemics, may increase the Company\u2019s cost of doing business or disrupt the Company\u2019s or its suppliers\u2019 operations.\nThe automotive industry is currently experiencing a semiconductor supply shortage that is having wide-ranging effects across the automotive supply chain including some of the Company\u2019s suppliers. During 2021, the shortage has had an impact on the ability of the Company to deliver products to dealers and customers. If the semiconductor supply shortage continues, the Company anticipates that production will be impacted in 2022.\nLiquidity Risks, Credit Ratings and Costs of Funds. Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the Company\u2019s sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of customers, dealers and suppliers. A lowering of the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets. The Company\u2019s Financial Services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper, medium-term notes and bank debt. If the markets for commercial paper, medium-term notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future, the Financial Services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets. This could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the Company is able to produce and sell to customers.\nThe Financial Services Industry is Highly Competitive. The Company\u2019s Financial Services segment competes with banks, other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing, higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates, which may lead to decreased margins, lower market share or both. A decline in the Company\u2019s truck unit sales and a decrease in used truck prices are also factors which may affect the Company\u2019s Financial Services segment.\nThe Financial Services Segment is Subject to Credit Risk. The Financial Services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer, dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans, leases and derivative contracts with the Company. Although the financial assets of the Financial Services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral, in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the Company, there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the Company, resulting in credit losses.\nInterest-Rate Risks. The Financial Services segment is subject to interest-rate risks, because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products, increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins. PFS uses derivative contracts to match the interest-rate characteristics of its debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates.\nInformation Technology. The Company relies on information technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of its business processes and activities. These computer systems and networks may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; computer viruses; or outside parties attempting to disrupt the Company\u2019s business or gain unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s electronic data. The Company maintains and continues to invest in protections to guard against such events. Examples of these protections include conducting third-party penetration tests, implementing software detection and prevention tools, event monitoring, and disaster recoverability. Additionally, the Company maintains a cybersecurity insurance policy. Despite these safeguards, there remains a risk of system disruptions, unauthorized access and data loss.\nIf the Company\u2019s computer systems were to be damaged, disrupted or breached, it could impact data availability and integrity, result in a theft of the Company\u2019s intellectual property or lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information of the Company\u2019s customers, suppliers and employees. Security breaches could also result in a violation of U.S. and international privacy and other laws and subject the Company to various litigations and governmental proceedings. These events could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, damage its reputation, disrupt operations and negatively impact competitiveness in the marketplace.\nPolitical, Regulatory and Economic Risks\nMultinational Operations. The Company\u2019s global operations are exposed to political, economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the Company operates. The Company may be adversely affected by political instabilities, fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems, natural calamities, wars, terrorism and labor strikes. Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and international trade policies may impact demand for the Company\u2019s products, financial results and competitive position. PACCAR\u2019s global operations are subject to extensive trade, competition and anti-corruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and various governmental responses to contain the outbreak continue to impact global economic activity and the Company\u2019s business. The economic disruptions from the pandemic are having an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results. The Company\u2019s workforce at a given location could be affected by a localized outbreak of COVID-19, necessitating facility slowdowns or shutdowns. As a result of pandemic-related economic disruptions, if one or more of the Company\u2019s suppliers could not produce needed parts or deliver at sufficient volumes to support the Company\u2019s production plans or aftermarket requirements, revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe full extent and duration of the adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business is uncertain and depends on the duration of the pandemic and the extent global and local economies are impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Changes to consumer behavior and labor markets as a result of COVID-19, as well as other pandemic related economic factors such as business failures, lower housing and construction starts, lower automobile sales, disruptions in financial markets or disruptions to the global supply chain, in particular the undersupply of semiconductor chips, could have further adverse effects on the Company\u2019s truck and parts revenues and operating results and may result in lower new truck financing volume, higher finance portfolio past dues, credit losses and used truck losses. Other unforeseen impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impact the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nLondon Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) Transition. Certain financing provided by PFS to dealers and retail customers, as well as financing extended to PFS are based on variable interest rate contracts. These contracts utilize various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, to establish applicable contract interest rates. PACCAR also utilizes hedging instruments and has line of credit arrangements which reference LIBOR (including other similar benchmark rates). On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority formally announced dates that various LIBOR rates will either stop being published or will be deemed as not representative. Certain tenors of U.S. LIBOR will be published through June 30, 2023, at which point they will have deemed to have lost representativeness.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s contracts which reference LIBOR, including dealer wholesale financing contracts, retail loan and lease contracts, medium-term notes, hedging instruments and line of credit arrangements, include fall-back language that specifies the methods to establish contract interest rates in the absence of LIBOR, or provide for the use of an alternative benchmark rate should LIBOR be discontinued. Alternative benchmark rates are now being used for all new retail loan and lease contracts.\nThe Company has retail loan and lease contracts with a December 31, 2021 balance of approximately $47 million, or less than 1% of PFS assets, referencing LIBOR that extend beyond June 30, 2023 and do not contain fall-back language or provide for the use of an alternative benchmark rate. The Company will seek to amend these contracts to allow for the use of an alternative benchmark rate.\nChanges to benchmark rates will have an uncertain impact on finance receivables and other financial obligations, the Company\u2019s current or future cost of funds and/or access to capital markets. The Company will attempt to minimize the impact of differences between the current and replacement benchmark rates through pricing adjustments on the financing provided by PFS, but it is not certain the Company will be able to do so. Based on the current balance of finance contracts referencing LIBOR, it is estimated that for a 10 basis point difference between the current and replacement benchmark rates that the Company is unable to recover through pricing adjustments, income before income taxes would decrease by approximately $.7 million. Accordingly, the Company does not expect the anticipated changes to the use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate will have a material impact on the results of operations.\nEnvironmental Regulations. The Company\u2019s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs. The Company could experience higher research and development and manufacturing costs due to changes in government requirements for its products, including changes in emissions, fuel, greenhouse gas or other regulations.\nLitigation, Product Liability and Regulatory. The Company\u2019s products are subject to recall for environmental, performance and safety-related issues. Product recalls, lawsuits, regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the Company establishes for contingencies may increase the Company\u2019s costs and lower profits. Due to the international nature of the Company\u2019s business, some products are also subject to international trade regulations, including customs and import / export related laws and regulations, government embargoes and sanctions prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries, as well as anti-corruption laws. The Company\u2019s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets, and claims or regulatory actions, even if unsuccessful or without merit, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity.\nCurrency Exchange and Translation. The Company\u2019s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries. Currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the Company\u2019s assets, liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk, as reported in the Company\u2019s financial statements. The Company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce, but not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nAccounting Estimates. In the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. Certain of these estimates, judgments and assumptions, such as residual values on operating leases, the allowance for credit losses and product warranty are particularly sensitive. If actual results are different from estimates used by management, they may have a material impact on the financial statements. For additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates, see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d under Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nTaxes. Changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the Company operates impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. Changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities.", "PERMNO": 60506, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "PCAR"}
