{"cik": "1085869", "company": "PERFICIENT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following factors together with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K before you decide to buy our common stock. These factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, or stock price. Many of the following risks and uncertainties are, and will be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, or stock price.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients\u2019 businesses and levels of business activity.\nGlobal macroeconomic and political conditions affect our clients\u2019 businesses and the markets they serve. Developments such as economic downturns, trade disputes, recessions, instability and inflationary risks in the United States,\nEurope, Canada, China, Colombia and India, among other developments, may have an adverse effect on our clients\u2019 businesses and, consequently, on our results of operations, revenue growth and profitability.\nVolatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in the markets we serve have undermined, and could in the future undermine, business confidence and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new technologies or initiatives or terminate existing contracts, which would negatively affect our business. Growth in markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate, in each case, for an extended period of time. Differing economic and political conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the markets we serve have affected, and may in the future affect, demand for our services. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 98% of our revenues were derived from our clients in North America. Weakening demand in this market could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty affects our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand beyond the short term and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting. This could result, for example, in us not having the level of appropriate personnel where they are needed or having to use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance.\nEconomic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and resulting changes in demand patterns to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operations, financial results and/or stock price.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant and widespread volatility, uncertainty and disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, including in the regions in which we operate. Certain of our customers have requested discounts or extended payment terms, paused or slowed services, or declared bankruptcy. The extent to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including but not limited to: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our clients and client demand for our services and solutions; our ability to sell and provide our services and solutions, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home; the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions; any changes to our clients\u2019 payment terms; any closures of our offices and facilities as we transitioned to working remotely; and any closures of our clients\u2019 offices and facilities because of government orders, recommendations or otherwise. Clients may also slow down decision making, delay planned work or seek to terminate or amend existing agreements in a manner adverse to the Company. Any of these events could cause or contribute to the other risks and uncertainties faced by the Company, as described in this Form 10-K and elsewhere, and could materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial results and/or stock price.\nWe face risks associated with potential changes to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and policies.\nSignificant changes to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and policies to which the Company is subject are under consideration by applicable government administrations and agencies. If enacted, these changes may affect our business in a manner that currently cannot be reliably predicted. These uncertainties may include changes in laws, regulations and policies in areas such as corporate taxation, international trade, labor and employment law, immigration and health care, which individually or in the aggregate could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe provide services to various clients participating in the healthcare market. Certain modifications to U.S. government healthcare programs and other changes have been proposed and discussed. These modifications may result in reduced expenditures by our healthcare customers on information technology projects, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations.\nOur revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product. As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, client demand for our services and solutions. In addition, developments in the markets we serve, which may be\nrapid, could shift demand to services and solutions where we are less competitive, or might require significant investment by us to upgrade, enhance or expand our services and solutions to meet that demand. Companies in the markets we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting, systems integration and technology, or outsourcing services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation. Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and often contain 10 to 30 day termination provisions. If a client is dissatisfied with our services and we are unable to effectively respond to its needs, the client might terminate existing contracts, or reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the lost revenues or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to recover such revenues. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client\u2019s strategy are also factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays, and in pressure to reduce costs.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, ever evolving, and subject to rapid technological change. Our competitors include: large multinational providers that offer some or all of the services that we do; offshore service providers in lower-cost locations that offer services similar to those we offer, often at highly competitive prices and on more aggressive contractual terms; niche solution and service providers or local competitors that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including companies that provide new or alternative products, service or delivery models; accounting firms that are expanding or building their capabilities to provide certain consulting services, including through acquisitions; and in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.\nMany of the larger regional and national information technology consulting firms have substantially longer operating histories, more established reputations and potential vendor relationships, greater financial resources, sales and marketing organizations, market penetration, and research and development capabilities, as well as broader product offerings, greater market presence, and name recognition.\nIn addition, there are relatively low barriers to entry in this market and therefore new entrants may compete with us in the future. For example, due to the rapid changes and volatility in our market, many well-capitalized companies, including some of our partners that have focused on sectors of the software and services industry that are not competitive with our business may refocus their activities and deploy their resources to be competitive with us.\nOur future financial performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector, through strategic mergers or acquisition. Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint, or offerings that are more attractive than ours. We believe that this competition could have a negative effect on our ability to compete for new work and skilled professionals. One or more of our competitors may develop and implement methodologies that result in superior productivity and price reductions without adversely affecting their profit margins. In addition, competitors may win client engagements by significantly discounting their services in exchange for a client\u2019s promise to purchase other goods and services from the competitor, either concurrently or in the future. These activities may potentially force us to lower our prices and suffer reduced operating margins. Any of these negative effects could significantly impair our results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to compete successfully against new or existing competitors.\nInternational operations subject us to additional political and economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe maintain global development centers in India, Colombia, China and Serbia. We have offices in the United Kingdom and Canada. We are subject to certain risks related to expanding our presence into non-U.S. regions, including risks related to complying with a wide variety of national and local laws, restrictions on the import and export of certain technologies, and multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures. In addition, we may face competition from companies that may have more experience with operations in these countries or with international operations generally. We may also face\ndifficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations, as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture.\nFurthermore, there are risks inherent in operating in and expanding into non-U.S. regions, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022political and economic instability;\n\u2022global health conditions and potential natural disasters;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including immigration restrictions, tariffs, and other trade barriers and tax regulations, the enforcement of such requirements by applicable governmental authorities and other legal uncertainty;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to repatriate cash from our international operations;\n\u2022complexities and additional costs in effectively managing our international operations;\n\u2022international currency controls and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022additional vulnerability from terrorist groups targeting U.S. interests abroad.\nAny one or more of the factors set forth above could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition, and operating results. These risks may be amplified in certain emerging markets in which we do business, including India and Colombia.\nOur results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants.\nOur success depends upon our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Current areas of significant change include mobility, cloud-based computing, software-as-a-service solutions, artificial intelligence, machine learning and the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data. Technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation for our core business as well as through new business initiatives beyond our core business that will enable us to differentiate our services and solutions. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected.\nIn addition, we operate in a quickly evolving environment, in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants. New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive, when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nStrategic and Operational Risks\nWe might not be successful at identifying, acquiring, or integrating other businesses.\nWe have pursued a disciplined acquisition strategy designed to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain markets. Depending upon the opportunities available, we may increase our investment in these acquisitions. In that pursuit, we may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, succeed in completing targeted transactions, or achieve desired results of operations. Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we acquire. Ongoing business may be disrupted and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by acquisitions, transition or integration activities. In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations.\nWe might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we make. We might not achieve our expected return on investment, or we may lose money. We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire, including from that company\u2019s known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients, or other third parties, and we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquisition, which could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business and profitability. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating\nany acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability, or competitive position in specific markets or services.\nOur results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing.\nIf we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer. The rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022general economic and political conditions;\n\u2022the competitive environment in our industry, as described below;\n\u2022our clients\u2019 desire to reduce their costs;\n\u2022our ability to accurately estimate, attain, and sustain contract revenues, margins, and cash flows over the full contract period; and\n\u2022procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.\nThe competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities, with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider. In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer. Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share. Further, if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity, they may be better positioned to offer services similar to ours at lower prices.\nIf our negotiated fees do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work, then our contracts could be unprofitable.\nWe negotiate fees with our clients by utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions, including time and materials and fixed fee contracts. Our fees are highly dependent upon our internal forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver such services and solutions, which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the level of effort or cost, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned, or be unprofitable. We could face greater risk when negotiating fees for our contracts that involve the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and/or utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies. There is a risk that we will underprice our contracts, fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work, or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts. In particular, any increased or unexpected costs, delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings, or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of services, including those caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our profit margin.\nThe loss of one or more of our significant software vendors could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have significant relationships with software vendors including IBM and Red Hat, Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and Sitecore. Our business relationships with these companies enable us to reduce our cost of acquiring customers and increase win rates through leveraging our vendors\u2019 marketing efforts and strong vendor endorsements. The loss of one or more of these relationships and endorsements could increase our sales and marketing costs, lead to longer sales cycles, harm our reputation and brand recognition, reduce our revenues, and adversely affect our results of operations. The financial impact of the loss of one or more software vendors is not reasonably estimable.\nOur ability to attract and retain business may depend upon our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe believe the Perficient brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches or service outages, or other delivery failures. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, employees, competitors, vendors, as well as members of the investment community and the media. There is a risk that negative information could adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements or cause existing clients to terminate our services, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our\nrecruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Perficient brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.\nOur profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful.\nOur ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent upon our ability to successfully manage our costs. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity, optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. These actions and other cost-management efforts may not be successful, our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability. Because of the significant steps taken in the past to reduce costs, we may not be able to continue to deliver efficiencies in our cost management, to the same degree as in the past. If we are not effective in reducing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, we might not be able to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces as we increase the number of colleagues and execute our growth strategy, control our costs or improve our efficiency, and our profitability could be negatively affected.\nIf we do not effectively manage expected future growth, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to operate profitably with positive cash flows depends partially upon how effectively we manage our expected future growth. In order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate an increase in demand for our services, we may need to implement new or upgraded operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, open new offices, and hire additional colleagues. Implementation of these new or upgraded systems, procedures, and controls may require substantial management efforts and our efforts to do so may not be successful. The opening of new offices (including international locations) or the hiring of additional colleagues may result in idle or underutilized capacity. We continually assess the expected capacity and utilization of our offices and colleagues. We may not be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of our offices and colleagues. If demand for our services does not meet our expectations, our revenues and cash flows may not be sufficient to offset these expenses and our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed. We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. We have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances. We might not accurately assess the credit worthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, including bankruptcy and insolvency. This could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. Recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depends upon our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIndebtedness and Liquidity Risks\nServicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle for cash conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes for cash upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn September 2018, we issued $143.8 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d), of which $5.1 million aggregate principal amount remains outstanding as of December 31, 2020, and in August 2020, we issued $230.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.250% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d) in private offerings. The 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes (together, the \u201cNotes\u201d) bear interest at a rate of 2.375% and 1.250% per year, respectively. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually. Our ability to make payments of the principal, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flows from operations in the future that are sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to\ngenerate such cash flows, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indentures governing the Notes (together, the \u201cIndentures\u201d)) at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon conversion, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases in connection with such conversion and our ability to pay may additionally be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Indentures or to pay any cash payable on future conversions as required by the Indentures would constitute a default under the Indentures. A default under the Indentures or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Notes Hedges.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the \u201cNote Hedges\u201d) with certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the \u201cOption Counterparties\u201d). We will be subject to the risk that one or more of the Option Counterparties, as financial institutions, might default under their respective Note Hedges. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Option Counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Global economic and political conditions could result in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of financial institutions. If any Option Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with such Option Counterparty.\nOur exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by any Option Counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the Option Counterparties.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us. The raising of any additional capital may dilute your ownership percentage in our stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $83.2 million and a borrowing capacity under our credit facility of $125.0 million, with $124.8 million unused capacity available, and a commitment from our lenders to increase our borrowing capacity by $75.0 million. Of the $83.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, $5.1 million was held by certain foreign subsidiaries which is not available to fund domestic operations unless the funds would be repatriated. We currently do not plan or foresee a need to repatriate such funds. The balance at December 31, 2020 also includes $5.7 million and $2.2 million in cash held by our Colombian and Chinese subsidiaries, respectively. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds if our capital is insufficient to pursue business opportunities and respond to business challenges. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences,\nand privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nHuman Capital Risks\nIf we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in large part, upon our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business. Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and there is much competition to attract qualified personnel. We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across North America, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the markets we serve or changes in the types of services clients are demanding we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. As we expand our services and solutions, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained. Additionally, if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work for our services and solutions in those markets may decline.\nWe are dependent upon retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized. We depend upon identifying, developing, and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses. This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is great. Our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to attract, retain and integrate both local business leaders and people with the appropriate skills.\nSimilarly, our profitability depends upon our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis. If we are unable to effectively deploy our employees on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our ability to perform our work profitably could suffer. If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed and our ability to staff projects. If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer. The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant. An important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world, which allows us to move talent as needed. Therefore, if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which it can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs.\nOur equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. If the anticipated value of these incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected.\nThere is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain markets, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if demand for our services were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs. At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographic locations. In these situations, we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in those markets.\nImmigration restrictions related to H1-B visas could hinder our growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApproximately 7% of our billable workforce is comprised of skilled foreign nationals holding H1-B visas. The H1-B visa classification enables us to hire qualified foreign workers in positions that require the equivalent of at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in the U.S. in a specialty occupation such as technology systems engineering and analysis. The H1-B visa generally permits an individual to work and live in the U.S. for a period of three to six years, with some extensions available. The number of new H1-B petitions approved in any federal fiscal year is limited, making the H1-B visas necessary to bring foreign employees to the U.S. unobtainable in years in which the limit is reached. The number of H1-B visas available, and the process to obtain them, may be subject to significant change. If we are unable to obtain all of the H1-B visas for which we apply, our growth or service offerings may be hindered.\nData Security and Intellectual Property Risks\nWe could have significant liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and Company data or information systems or if our information systems are breached.\nWe are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations and with our partners and clients. Security breaches of this infrastructure or human error could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. There has been a global increase in information technology security threats and increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks. Given the uncertainty of such attacks, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks and disputes. In providing services to clients, we are also required at times to manage, utilize, and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as various U.S. federal and state laws and foreign laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and/or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through systems failure, human error or negligence, cyber attacks, security breaches, fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber attacks and other related breaches.\nOur services could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe cannot be sure that our services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and we could have infringement claims (including meritless claims) asserted against us. These claims may harm our reputation, cause our management to expend significant time in connection with any defense, and cost us money. We may be required to indemnify clients for any expense or liabilities they incur resulting from claimed infringement and these expenses could exceed the amounts paid to us by the client for services we have performed. Any claims in this area, even if won by us, could be costly, time-consuming, and harmful to our reputation.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property. Existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure, and other contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours. Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.\nDepending upon the circumstances, we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do. In certain situations, we might forego rights to the use\nof intellectual property we help create or knowledge associated with such creation, which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property or knowledge for other clients. Any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects.\nLegal and Tax Risks\nOur business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions.\nWe could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or otherwise breach obligations, to third parties, including clients, partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients. We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines. In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace. We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss. If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. A failure of a client\u2019s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations. In addition to expense, litigation can be lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations, and litigation results can be unpredictable. While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, this insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and the amount of our recovery, if any.\nChanges in our level of taxes, audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation or enforcement could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our corporate provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the disallowance of certain research credits claimed by the Company and the Company\u2019s actions to assert such credits. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control. Increases in the tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a negative impact on our profitability. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties, or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable and could materially adversely affect our tax position.\nFinancial Risks\nWe make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The application of these principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition, purchase accounting related fair value measurements, contingent consideration, fair value of convertible debt and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time they are made. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of our judgment and can be subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If our estimates, or the\nassumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAlthough we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a small portion of our revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBecause our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, denominated in other currencies. These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods. Our currency hedging program, which is designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful.\nAs we continue to leverage our global delivery model, certain of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services. An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, Indian rupee, Chinese yuan, British pound, euro, and Colombian peso against the U.S. dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency. Our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful. This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources. Conversely, a decrease in the value of certain currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, Indian rupee, Chinese yuan, British pound, euro, and Colombian peso against the U.S. dollar in which our revenue is recorded could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost. In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk. These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts, risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations. We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, hostilities or natural disasters could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging. Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nTransactions relating to our Notes may affect the value of our common stock.\nOur Notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders under certain circumstances. If holders of our Notes elect to convert their notes, we may settle our conversion obligation by delivering to them a significant number of shares of our common stock, which would cause dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIn addition, in connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into the Notes Hedges with the Option Counterparties. If the Company exercises the Notes Hedges, the aggregate amount of cash received from the Option Counterparties will cover the aggregate amount of cash that the Company would be required to pay to the holders of the Notes,\nless the principal amount thereof. Also in connection with the issuance of the Notes, we sold net-share-settled warrants (the \u201cNotes Warrants\u201d) in privately negotiated transactions with the Option Counterparties. The Notes Hedges and Notes Warrants are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion or settlement of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nOur stock price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors. These factors include:\n\u2022changes in macroeconomic or political factors unrelated to our business;\n\u2022general or industry-specific market conditions or changes in financial markets;\n\u2022announcements by us or competitors about developments in our business or prospects;\n\u2022projections or speculation about our business or that of competitors by the media or investment analysts; and\n\u2022our ability to meet our growth and financial objectives, including with respect to our overall revenue growth, revenue growth for our priority emerging markets and earnings per share growth.\nOur results of operations have varied in the past and could vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, making them difficult to predict. Some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include:\n\u2022the business decisions of our clients to begin to curtail or reduce the use of our services, including in response to changes in macroeconomic or political conditions unrelated to our business or general market conditions;\n\u2022periodic differences between our clients\u2019 estimated and actual levels of business activity associated with ongoing work, as well as the stage of completion of existing projects and/or their termination or restructuring;\n\u2022contract delivery inefficiencies, such as those due to poor delivery or changes in forecasts;\n\u2022our ability to transition employees quickly from completed to new projects and maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our workforces;\n\u2022acquisition, integration and operational costs related to businesses acquired;\n\u2022the introduction of new products or services by us, competitors or partners;\n\u2022changes in our pricing or competitors\u2019 pricing;\n\u2022our ability to manage costs, including those for our own or subcontracted personnel, travel, support services and severance;\n\u2022changes in, or the application of changes in, accounting principles or pronouncements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, particularly those related to revenue recognition;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022changes in estimates, accruals or payments of variable compensation to our employees;\n\u2022global, regional and local economic and political conditions and related risks, including acts of terrorism; and\n\u2022seasonality, including number of workdays, holidays and summer vacations.\nAs a result of any of the above factors, or any of the other risks described in this Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d our stock price could be difficult to predict, and our stock price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our stock in the future.\nOur officers, directors, and 5% and greater stockholders own a large percentage of our voting securities and their interests may differ from other stockholders.\nOur executive officers, directors, and 5% and greater stockholders beneficially own or control approximately 31% of the voting power of our common stock. This concentration of voting power of our common stock may make it difficult for our other stockholders to successfully approve or defeat matters that may be submitted for action by our stockholders. It may also have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change in control of the Company.\nIt may be difficult for another company to acquire us, and this could depress our stock price.\nIn addition to the voting securities held by our officers, directors, and 5% and greater stockholders, provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, Delaware law and certain provisions of the Notes could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable by authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. In addition, provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law also restrict some\nbusiness combinations with interested stockholders. These provisions are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow the Board of Directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value. Additionally, certain provisions of our convertible notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals, or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price.", "PERMNO": 87086, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PRFT"}
