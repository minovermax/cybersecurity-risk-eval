{"cik": "879682", "company": "VIVEVE MEDICAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included or referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before purchasing shares of our common stock. There are numerous and varied risks that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors in our common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nWe or our distributors may be unable to obtain or maintain international regulatory clearances or approvals for our current or future products, or our distributors may be unable to obtain necessary qualifications, which could harm our business.\nSales of the Viveve System internationally are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the U.S. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process, and marketing approval or clearance is not certain. The time required to obtain clearances or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approvals, and requirements for such clearances or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. We may rely on third-party distributors to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals required in other countries, and these distributors may be unable to obtain or maintain such clearances or approvals. Our distributors may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or clearances, which could increase the difficulty of attracting and retaining qualified distributors. If our distributors experience delays in receiving necessary qualifications, clearances or approvals to market our products outside the U.S., or if they fail to receive those qualifications, clearances or approvals, we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets effectively, or at all.\nForeign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, to the extent we market and sell our products outside of the U.S., we may be subject to rigorous international regulation in the future. In these circumstances, we would be required to rely on our foreign independent distributors to comply with the varying regulations, and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our product in foreign countries.\nIf we fail to maintain regulatory approvals and clearances, or if we are unable to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or approvals for the Viveve System or any future products we may develop or acquire, including product enhancements, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Viveve System is, and any future products we may acquire or develop will be, subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. In particular, the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received clearance under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the \u201cFDCA\u201d) (unless the device is exempt from the 510(k) requirements), has been classified pursuant to a de novo classification request, or is the subject of an approved premarket approval application (\u201cPMA\u201d). The FDA will permit marketing of a lower risk medical device through the 510(k) process if the manufacturer demonstrates that the new product is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMA, referred to as a predicate device. Devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or devices not deemed substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, require the approval of a PMA, unless a de novo submission is appropriate. The PMA process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA a reasonable assurance of the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use.\nIf the FDA has not issued a regulation classifying a particular type of device as Class I, and if there is no known predicate for a device and/or its indication, the device is automatically Class III, regardless of the risk the device poses. If a device is automatically/statutorily classified into Class III in this manner, a company can petition FDA to reclassify the category of devices into Class II or Class I via a process known as \u201cEvaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,\u201d which is typically referred to as the de novo process. The direct de novo process allows a company to request that a new product classification be established without the company first submitting a 510(k) notification for the device. Our plan is to seek FDA authorization to market the Viveve System for the treatment of SUI by utilizing the direct de novo process. However, we cannot predict when or if such de novo classification will be obtained. If FDA fails to reclassify the device pursuant to the de novo process, we will be required to seek FDA premarket approval (via the more stringent PMA process) for the Viveve System, which will be extremely costly and very time-consuming, often taking as long as several years. Delays in receipt of FDA clearance or approval or failure to receive FDA clearance or approval could adversely affect our business, results of operations and future growth prospects.\nOur marketed products may be used by physicians for indications that are not cleared by the FDA. If the FDA finds that we marketed our products in a manner that promoted off-label use, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nUnder the FDCA and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses. This means that we may not make claims about the use of any of our marketed medical device products outside of their approved or cleared indications, and that our website, advertising promotional materials and training methods may not promote or encourage unapproved uses. The Viveve System is currently indicated for use, and being marketed for use, in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis in the United States. The device has not been cleared or approved for use for SUI, vaginal laxity, to improve sexual function, or for vaginal rejuvenation in the United States. Therefore, we may not provide information to physicians or patients that promote the Viveve System for SUI, vaginal laxity, to improve sexual function, or for vaginal rejuvenation. Note, however, that the FDA does not generally restrict physicians from prescribing products for off-label uses (or using products in an off-label manner) in their practice of medicine. We are also permitted to engage in non-promotional scientific exchange in response to unsolicited questions by physicians about our products. Should the FDA determine that our activities constitute the promotion of off-label uses, the FDA could bring action to prevent us from distributing our devices for the off-label use and could impose fines and penalties on us and our executives. In addition, failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising can result in, among other things, the FDA\u2019s refusal to approve or clear other products in our pipeline such as clearance or approval to treat SUI, the withdrawal of an approved product from the market, product recalls, fines, disgorgement of profits, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecutions. Any of these adverse regulatory actions could result in substantial costs and could significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf the Office of Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), or another federal or state agency determines that we have promoted off-label use of our products, we may be subject to various penalties, including civil or criminal penalties, and the off-label use of our products may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.\nIn addition to the FDA restrictions on our marketed products, other state and federal healthcare laws have been applied by DOJ and state attorneys general to restrict certain marketing practices in the medical device industry. While physicians may generally prescribe and administer products for off-label uses, if we engage in off-label promotion, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties including significant fines and could be prohibited from participating in government healthcare programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Even if we are successful in resolving such matters without incurring penalties, responding to investigations or prosecutions will likely result in substantial costs and could significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and ability to finance our operations. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to patients, and, in turn, the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us.\nIf we modify an FDA-cleared device, we may need to seek and obtain new clearances, which, if not granted, would prevent the sale of our modified product or require us to redesign the product.\nAny modifications to an FDA-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a premarket approval. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, our existing product in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn could harm our revenue and potential future profitability. We have made modifications to our device in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees, and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified device, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign the product.\nClinical trials necessary to support a 510(k) notification, de novo petition or PMA application will be expensive and will require the enrollment of large numbers of patients. Suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Delays or failures in our clinical trials may prevent us from commercializing our current product or any modified or new products and will adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nThe FDA has asked us to conduct a clinical study, pursuant to the agency\u2019s IDE regulations, to support a future product submission for the Viveve System. Initiating and completing clinical trials necessary to support a 510(k) notification, de novo petition, or PMA application for the Viveve System, as well as other possible future product candidates, is time consuming and expensive and the outcome is uncertain. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any product we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials.\nConducting successful clinical studies will require the enrollment of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the desirability of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects, the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators and support staff, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the ability of patients to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of our product or if they determine that the treatments received under the trial protocols are not desirable or involve unacceptable risk or discomfort.\nDevelopment of sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy are required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support clearance or approval. Further, the FDA may require us to submit data on a greater number of patients than we originally anticipated and/or for a longer follow-up period or change the data collection requirements or data analysis applicable to our clinical trials. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial may cause an increase in costs and delays in the approval or clearance and attempted commercialization of our product or result in the failure of the clinical trial. In addition, despite considerable time and expense invested in clinical trials, the FDA may not consider our data adequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nFinally, even if our clinical trials receive IDE approval from FDA, this does not guarantee that FDA will find our clinical trial data sufficient to support an application for FDA clearance or approval. For example, after submitting an application to FDA, the agency may raise questions during the review process regarding the clinical trial data, including those related to clinical trial design considerations. If FDA has questions regarding the clinical study design or clinical trial results, FDA may issue an Additional Information (\u201cAI\u201d) request to Viveve as part of the review process. If FDA issues an AI request, FDA\u2019s review clock is stopped until Viveve provides information responsive to FDA\u2019s requests. An AI request may delay the process for obtaining FDA clearance or approval. Further, if FDA ultimately does not find Viveve\u2019s clinical trial design or clinical data to be sufficient to support the safety and efficacy of the Viveve System for proposed indication, there is a risk that FDA may not grant clearance or approval of our application.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with preclinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain the regulatory clearance or approval which would permit us to commercialize our products.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct the preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product, therefore we must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct the studies and trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, or be able to successfully commercialize, our product on a timely basis, if at all. In that event, our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected.\nThe results of our clinical trials such as our PURSUIT trial may not support our proposed product claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects. As our business prospects depend substantially on the success of our PURSUIT trial, any of these events with respect to our PURSUIT trial could have a material adverse impact on our business and affect our ability to continue as a going concern.\nEven if our clinical trials, including the PURSUIT trial, are completed as planned, it cannot be certain that the results of the clinical trials will support our proposed claims for the Viveve System, that the FDA or foreign authorities will agree with our conclusions regarding them or that even if our product receives regulatory approval or clearance, that it will not later result in adverse side effects that limit or prevent its use. Success in preclinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and preclinical studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses. Any delay of our clinical trials or failure by the FDA or other foreign authorities to accept our product claims will delay, or even prevent, our ability to commercialize our product and generate revenue.\nFor example, in April 2020, we reported the topline results of our VIVEVE II clinical trial consisting of a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the company's proprietary, CMRF technology for the improvement of sexual function in women following vaginal childbirth. The data showed that the VIVEVE II study did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the mean change from baseline in total FSFI score at 12 months.\nWe continue to advance our clinical development program in SUI in the United States under our PURSUIT clinical trial. The top-line results of this clinical trial are anticipated at the end of 2022. If the data is not positive, our clinical trial may not support our proposed product claims for FDA clearance or approval of the Viveve System for the treatment of SUI. In such a case, we will be unable to promote the Viveve System in the United States for the SUI indication, our business prospects will be substantially affected and we may need to reevaluate our ability to continue as a going concern and/or seek strategic alternatives.\nEven if our product is approved by regulatory authorities, if we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA or other foreign regulatory authority requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product, the product could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product for which we obtain clearance or approval, and the manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies, such as the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health (\u201cCDPH\u201d). In particular, we and our suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, and International Standards Organization (\u201cISO\u201d) standards for the manufacture of our product and other regulations which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain clearance or approval. Regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, enforce the QSR and other regulations through periodic inspections. In the past, our Sunnyvale, California facility has been inspected by the FDA and CDPH, and observations were noted. The FDA and CDPH have accepted our responses to these observations, and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the QSR. Any future failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions and unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions:\n\u25cf\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u25cf\ncustomer notifications for repair, replacement or refunds;\n\u25cf\nrecall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u25cf\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf\nrefusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or premarket approval of new products or modified products;\n\u25cf\noperating restrictions;\n\u25cf\nreclassifying a device that previously received a 510(k) clearance or withdrawing a PMA approval that was previously granted;\n\u25cf\nrefusal to grant export approval for our product; or\n\u25cf\ncriminal prosecution.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue. Furthermore, our third-party manufacturers may not currently be, or may not continue to be, in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements which could result in a failure to produce our product on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nEven if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted for the Viveve System or future products, such clearance or approval may be subject to limitations on the intended uses for which the product may be marketed and reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing or educational activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIn addition, we may be required by the FDA or other foreign regulatory bodies to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products, and we must comply with medical device reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events and malfunctions related to our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as the QSR, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nThe Viveve System may also be subject to state regulations which are, in many instances, in flux. Changes in state regulations may impede sales. For example, federal regulations may allow the device to be sold to, or on the order of, \u201clicensed practitioners,\u201d as determined on a state-by-state basis. As a result, in some states, non-physicians may legally purchase and operate our device. However, a state could change its regulations at any time, disallowing sales to particular types of end users. We cannot predict the impact or effect of future legislation or regulations at the federal or state levels.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, our business would suffer.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s QSR. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our product. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections. We anticipate that in the future we will be subject to such inspections. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of our manufacturing operations, a recall of our product, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions, which would cause our reputation, sales and business to suffer.\nIf our product causes or contributes to a death or a serious injury, or malfunctions in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device were to recur. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving the Viveve System or future products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as mounting a defense to a legal action, if one were to be brought, would require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nThe Viveve System may, in the future, be subject to product corrections, removals, or recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. A recall of our product would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. In the future, we may initiate one or more voluntary correction or removal actions involving our product that we determine do not require notification to the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, the FDA could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the corrections, removals, or recalls when they were conducted.\nFederal and state regulatory reforms may adversely affect our ability to sell our product profitably.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of a medical device. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nFor example, in August 2010, the FDA issued its preliminary recommendations on reform of the 510(k) pre-market notification process for medical devices. On January 19, 2011, the FDA announced its \u201cPlan of Action\u201d for implementing these recommendations. The Plan of Action included 25 action items, most of which have now been implemented by the agency. In August 2016, the FDA released its proposals for reforming long-standing procedures and requirements related to modifications to medical devices already on the market. In December 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which makes multiple changes to FDA\u2019s rules for medical devices as well as for clinical trials, and Congress (passed the Medical Device User Fee reauthorization package in 2017.\nThe FDA or Congress may implement other reforms in the future. Future reforms could have the effect of making it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain FDA clearance or approval. Such changes may also be made by legislators or regulators in the foreign jurisdictions in which we do business and could similarly affect our operations and profitability in those markets.\nIn addition, a state could change its statutes or regulations at any time, disallowing sales to particular types of end users or placing restrictions on certain chemicals, such as those used in our cryogen. We cannot predict the impact or effect of future legislation or regulations at the federal or state levels, or in any foreign jurisdiction in which we do business.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws associated with our activities outside the U.S. could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nA significant portion of our revenue is and will be from jurisdictions outside of the U.S. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of directing, obtaining or keeping business, and requires companies to maintain reasonable books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA applies to companies and individuals alike, including company directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by employees, strategic or local partners or other representatives. In addition, the government may seek to rely on a theory of successor liability and hold us responsible for FCPA violations committed by companies or associated with assets which we acquire. In recent years, the medical device and pharmaceutical industries have been a focus of the U.S. government\u2019s FCPA enforcement priorities, and settlements often include very significant payments potentially consisting of millions of dollars. Other countries have similar laws to which we may be subject, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act.\nIn many foreign countries where we operate, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom for businesses to engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other similar laws and regulations. In contrast, we have implemented a company policy requiring our employees and consultants to comply with the FCPA and similar laws. At the present time, we have not conducted formal FCPA compliance training for our foreign distributors and partners, but we are in the process of devising a training schedule for certain of our employees, agents and partners. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that our employees, partners and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of the FCPA or our policies for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As a result of our anticipated growth, our development of infrastructure designed to identify FCPA matters and monitor compliance is at an early stage. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and financial conditions. We may also face collateral consequences, such as debarment and the loss of our export privileges.\nViveve\u2019s relationships with customers and healthcare providers and professionals may be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, as well as comparable state and foreign laws, which could expose Viveve to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers and physicians play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any medical product, including the Viveve System marketed by the Company. Viveve\u2019s future arrangements with customers, healthcare providers and other medical professionals could expose Viveve to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which Viveve markets, sells and distributes its medical device products. There are various federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that impose restrictions that may apply to Viveve, and there may also be comparable foreign laws and regulations that similarly could apply to the Company.\nThe federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federally funded healthcare programs. This statute has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers and purchasers, among others. There are similar laws at the state level in the U.S., and several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have enacted similar anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, and healthcare laws and regulations.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nThe federal Physician Sunshine Act requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to together as the Affordable Care Act, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [Medicare] or under a State plan under title XIX [Medicaid] or XXI [SCHIP] of the Social Security Act (or a waiver of such a plan) to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made to or at the request of covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, and physician ownership and investment interests in such manufacturers. Payments made to physicians and research institutions for clinical trials are included within the scope of this federal disclosure law.\nAnalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Some state laws also require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to comply with the relevant industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines, in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. There may also be comparable foreign laws and regulations that could impact Viveve\u2019s business and operations.\nIf Viveve\u2019s operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to it, the Company may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, or fines. Moreover, if any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom Viveve expects to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, or potentially to other sanctions in foreign jurisdictions.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are dependent upon the success of the Viveve System, which has a limited commercial history. If the device fails to gain or loses market acceptance, our business will suffer.\nIn 2012, we began marketing the Viveve System (RF generator, handpiece and single-use treatment tips) and other ancillary consumables, in Canada, Hong Kong and Japan. Since then, we have expanded our market to a total of 50 countries, including the United States. Our continued success depends on our ability to significantly penetrate current or new markets. If demand for the Viveve System and Viveve treatment does not expand in new markets or does not increase in existing markets as we anticipate, or if demand declines, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nWe compete against companies that have more established products, longer operating histories and greater resources, which may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration or increased operating results.\nThe medical device and aesthetics markets are highly competitive and dynamic and are marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. Demand for the Viveve System could be diminished by equivalent or superior products and technologies developed by competitors. Specifically, Viveve competes against other offerings in these markets, including laser and other light-based medical devices, pharmaceutical and consumer products, surgical procedures and exercise therapies.\nCompeting in these markets could result in price-cutting, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our company, the Viveve System, and the Viveve treatment from our competitors and their products, on such factors as:\n\u25cf\nsafety and effectiveness;\n\u25cf\nproduct pricing;\n\u25cf\nsuccess of our marketing initiatives;\n\u25cf\ncompelling clinical data;\n\u25cf\nintellectual property protection;\n\u25cf\nquality of customer support; and\n\u25cf\ndevelopment of successful distribution channels, both domestically and internationally.\nSome of our competitors have more established products and customer relationships than we have, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. For example, we may encounter situations where, due to pre-existing relationships, potential customers decide to purchase additional products from our competitors. Potential customers may need to recoup the cost of expensive products that they have already purchased to perform general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis, LVR surgery or vaginoplasty and thus may decide not to purchase, or to delay the purchase of, the Viveve System. If we are unable to achieve continued market penetration, we will be unable to compete effectively, and our business will be harmed.\nIn addition, potential competitors could have significantly greater financial, research and development, manufacturing, and sales and marketing resources than we have and could utilize their greater resources to acquire or develop new technologies or products that could effectively compete with our existing product. Given the relatively few competitors currently in the market, any such action could exacerbate existing competitive pressures, which could harm our business.\nWe have limited data regarding the efficacy of the Viveve procedure. If future data supporting additional indications is not positive or consistent with our prior experience, rates of physician adoption will likely be harmed.\nCurrent reported studies of Viveve\u2019s CMRF technology have investigated improvement in vaginal laxity, sexual function and SUI, where all patients enrolled in the trial received the same treatment without comparison to a control group. Clinical studies designed in a randomized, blinded and controlled fashion (e.g., assessing the efficacy of a product or therapy versus a placebo or sham group) represent the gold-standard in clinical trial design. A sham-controlled treatment or procedure refers to a procedure performed as a control and that is similar to the treatment or procedure under investigation without the key therapeutic element being investigated. Future clinical studies, which may be required to drive physician adoption or support regulatory clearance or approval, will likely require randomized, blinded and controlled trial designs. Since 2014, we conducted several randomized, blinded and sham-controlled clinical trials in Europe, Canada and the U.S. designed to demonstrate the efficacy of the Viveve procedure versus a sham-controlled procedure for the treatment of vaginal laxity and sexual function. In 2019, we reported clinical results for a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study conducted in Canada evaluating patients suffering from mild-to-moderate SUI. Statistical significance was not achieved on the primary endpoint of mean change from baseline on the one-hour Pad Weight Test at six months post-treatment compared to the control group, nor was statistical significance achieved for the exploratory endpoints. In April 2020, we reported the topline results of our VIVEVE II clinical trial consisting of a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the company's proprietary, CMRF technology for the improvement of sexual function in women following vaginal childbirth. The data showed that the VIVEVE II study did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the mean change from baseline in total FSFI score at 12 months. In July 2020, the Company received FDA approval of its IDE application to conduct its U.S. pivotal, multicenter PURSUIT trial for improvement of SUI in women, as well as FDA approval of requested amendments to the IDE protocol in December 2020. PURSUIT is a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled trial with an intended enrollment of approximately 390 subjects at up to 30 study sites in the U.S.\nAdditionally, we have not conducted any head-to-head clinical studies that compare results from treatment with the Viveve System to surgery or treatment with other therapies. Without head-to-head studies against competing alternative treatments, which we have no current plans to conduct, potential customers may not find clinical studies of our technology sufficiently compelling to purchase the Viveve System. If we decide to pursue additional studies in the future, such studies could be expensive and time consuming, and the data collected may not produce favorable or compelling results. If the results of such studies do not meet physicians\u2019 expectations, the Viveve procedure may not become widely adopted, physicians may recommend alternative treatments for their patients, and our business may be harmed.\nWe currently have clearance to market the Viveve System in the U.S. for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis but not for vaginal laxity, sexual function, or SUI. If we want to sell our device and single-use treatment tips in the U.S. for the treatment of vaginal laxity, sexual function, or SUI, we will need to obtain additional FDA clearance or approval, which may not be granted.\nDeveloping and promoting our CMRF technology in additional countries for additional indications, including the U.S., is a key element of our future growth strategy. We currently do not have FDA clearance or approval to market the Viveve System in the U.S. for the treatment of vaginal laxity, sexual function, or SUI. We intend to seek clearance or approval for SUI from the FDA to expand our marketing efforts and have engaged with the FDA to help improve our likelihood of success. However, because the topline results from our VIVEVE II clinical trial did not meet the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the mean change from baseline compared to sham treatment in total FSFI at 12 months, we no longer intend to pursue a sexual function or vaginal laxity label in the U.S. We cannot predict whether we will receive clearance or approval for SUI. The FDA has required us to conduct clinical trials to support regulatory clearance or approval, which trials are time-consuming and expensive, and may produce results that do not result in clearance or approval of our FDA marketing application. In the event that we do not obtain FDA clearance or approval of the Viveve System for the treatment of SUI, we will be unable to promote it in the U.S. for that indication, and the ability to grow our revenue may be adversely affected.\nOur business is not currently profitable, and we may not be able to achieve profitability even if we are able to generate significant revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have incurred losses since inception of approximately $241.9 million. In 2021 and 2020, we incurred losses of $22.0 million and $21.9 million, respectively. Even though our revenue may increase, we expect to incur significant additional losses while we grow and expand our business. We cannot predict if and when we will achieve profitability. Our failure to achieve and sustain profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and may require us to seek additional financing for our business. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional financing or that any such financing will be on terms that are favorable to us.\nIf there is not sufficient consumer demand for the procedures performed with our products, demand for our products could decline, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nThe medical device and aesthetic markets in which we operate are particularly vulnerable to economic trends. The procedures performed using the Viveve System are elective procedures that are not currently reimbursable through government or private health insurance. The cost of these elective procedures must be borne by the patient. As a result, the decision to undergo a procedure that uses our products may be influenced by the cost.\nConsumer demand, and therefore our business, is sensitive to a number of factors that affect consumer spending, including political and macroeconomic conditions, health of credit markets, disposable consumer income levels, consumer debt levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and other factors. If there is not sufficient consumer demand for the procedures performed with our products, practitioner demand for our products would decline, and our business would suffer.\nIt is difficult to forecast future performance, which may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to predict future performance. Additionally, the demand for the Viveve System may vary from quarter to quarter. A number of factors, over which we have limited or no control, may contribute to fluctuations in our financial results, such as:\n\u25cf\ndelays in receipt of anticipated purchase orders;\n\u25cf\nperformance of our independent distributors;\n\u25cf\npositive or negative media coverage of the Viveve treatment or products of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain further regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u25cf\ndelays in, or failure of, product and component deliveries by our subcontractors and suppliers;\n\u25cf\ncustomer response to the introduction of new product offerings; and\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in foreign currency.\nOur limited operating history has limited our ability to determine an appropriate sales price for our products.\nOur historical operating performance has limited our ability to determine the proper sales or lease prices for the Viveve System and the single-use treatment tips. Establishing appropriate pricing for our capital equipment and components has been challenging because there have not existed directly comparable competitive products. We may experience similar pricing challenges in the future as we enter new markets or introduce new products, which could have an unanticipated negative impact on our financial performance.\nIf there is not sufficient patient demand for our treatments, practitioner demand for the Viveve System could drop, resulting in lower revenue and unfavorable operating results.\nAll procedures performed using the Viveve System are elective procedures, the cost of which must be borne by the patient and are not currently reimbursable through government or private health insurance. The decision to undergo a Viveve treatment is thus driven by consumer demand, which may be influenced by a number of factors, such as:\n\u25cf\nwhether our marketing efforts directed toward increasing consumer awareness of the Viveve treatment, for which we have limited experience and resources and indications, are successful;\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which physicians recommend the Viveve treatment to their patients;\n\u25cf\nthe cost, safety and effectiveness of the Viveve procedure versus alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\ngeneral consumer sentiment about the benefits and risks of such procedures; and\n\u25cf\nconsumer confidence, which may be impacted by economic and political conditions.\nOur financial performance could be materially harmed in the event that any of the above factors discourage patients from seeking the Viveve treatment.\nThe failure of the Viveve treatment to meet patient expectations or the occurrence of unpleasant side effects from a Viveve treatment could impair our financial performance.\nOur future success depends upon patients having a positive experience with the Viveve treatment in order to increase physician demand for our products, as a result of positive feedback and word-of-mouth referrals. Patients may be dissatisfied if their expectations of the procedure, side effects and results, among other things, are not met. Despite what we believe to be the safety of the Viveve treatment, patients may experience undesirable side-effects such as temporary swelling or reddening of the treated tissue. Experiencing any of these side effects could discourage a patient from completing a Viveve treatment or discourage a patient from having future procedures or referring the Viveve procedure to others. In order to generate referral business, we believe that patients must be satisfied with the effectiveness of the Viveve treatment. Results obtained from the procedure are subjective and may be subtle. The Viveve treatment may produce results that may not meet patients\u2019 expectations. If patients are not satisfied with the procedure or feel that it is too expensive for the results obtained, our reputation and future sales will suffer.\nOur success depends on growing physician adoption of the Viveve System and continued use of treatment tips.\nSome of our target physician customers already own self-pay device products. Our ability to grow our business and convince physicians to purchase or rent a Viveve System depends on the success of our sales and marketing efforts. Our business model involves both an equipment rental or purchase and continued purchases by our customers of single-use treatment tips and ancillary consumables. This may be a novel business model for many potential customers who may be used to competing products that are exclusively capital equipment, such as many laser-based systems. We must be able to demonstrate that the cost of the Viveve System and the revenue that the physician can derive from performing procedures using it are compelling when compared to the cost and revenue associated with alternative products or therapies. When marketing to plastic surgeons, we must also, in some cases, overcome a bias against non-invasive procedures. If we are unable to increase physician adoption of our device and use of the treatment tips, our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nOur revenue may suffer due to our transition of U.S. sales from a capital equipment sales model to a recurring revenue rental model.\nIn June 2019, in addition to a capital sales model, we began a new recurring revenue rental model for the U.S. sales of the Viveve System. The new U.S. commercial sales model is intended to lower up-front costs for customers and thus lower hurdles to adoption, increase placement rates, and improve profitability by reducing selling time per unit. The recurring revenue rental model has resulted in reduced revenue per unit placed, but it is projected to be offset by higher unit placements and improved revenue performance in the long term. While we believe physician adoption rates may be higher in the future utilizing this new recurring revenue rental model, the unit placements in the long term may not be sufficient to offset the reduced revenue per unit placed.\nTo successfully market and sell the Viveve System internationally, we must address many issues with which we have limited experience.\nSales outside the U.S. accounted for 42%, 54% and 44% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. International sales are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in penetrating markets in which our competitors\u2019 products may be more established;\n\u25cf\nreduced or no protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf\nexport restrictions, trade regulations and foreign tax laws;\n\u25cf\nfluctuating foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf\nforeign certification and regulatory clearance or approval requirements;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in developing effective marketing campaigns for unfamiliar, foreign countries;\n\u25cf\ncustoms clearance and shipping delays;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with anti-bribery laws such as U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and its foreign counterparts;\n\u25cf\npolitical and economic instability and global conflicts such as the war in Ukraine; and\n\u25cf\npreference for locally produced products.\nIf one or more of these risks were realized, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy the situation, and even if we are able to find a solution, our revenues may still decline.\nIf we violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or applicable anti-bribery laws in other countries our business could be harmed.\nWe earn a significant portion of our total revenues from international sales. As a result, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and requires companies to maintain appropriate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the Company. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by agents or local partners or representatives. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies which we acquire. We are also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act and may be subject to certain anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we do business. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or the anti-corruption laws of other countries, governmental authorities in the U.S. or other countries could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\nWe depend on distributors to market and sell the Viveve System internationally. If they are not successful, our marketing and sales efforts will be harmed.\nWe currently depend exclusively on third-party distributors to sell and service the Viveve System internationally and to train our international customers, and if these distributors terminate their relationships with us or under-perform, we may be unable to maintain or increase our level of international revenue. We will also need to engage additional international distributors to grow our business and expand the territories in which we sell the Viveve System. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market, sell and service our device to the level of our expectations. If current or future distributors do not perform adequately, or if we are unable to engage distributors in particular geographic areas, our revenue from international operations will be adversely affected.\nThe ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could seriously harm our research and development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts, increase our costs and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our ongoing or planned research and development activities, our manufacturing operations and our commercialization efforts. COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the U.S. and global economies and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak is continually evolving and, as additional cases of the virus are identified, many countries, including the U.S., have reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel and mandatory closures of businesses. Certain states and cities, including where we or the third parties with whom we engage operate, have also reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, \u201cshelter in place\u201d rules, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, and/or restrictions on the types of projects that may continue. However, these government policies and directives are subject to change and many companies, including ours, maintain a work-from-home policy for office employees and sales representatives, and have implemented policies for our researchers and manufacturing workers designed to provide for a safe environment while maintaining progress on important laboratory research and commercial product supply.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, impacts our product development, manufacturing capabilities, sales and marketing operations, future nonclinical studies and clinical trials and commercialization efforts will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of such pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the full adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and it may have the effect of heightening many of the risks described herein, including the below.\n\u25cf We are currently evaluating the Viveve System and Viveve treatment in a clinical trial. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on the timing of conducting these trials, including initiation, opening of clinical trial sites and enrollment of patients and patient follow up. We are aware that some trial sponsors have encountered and may continue to encounter challenges in conducting clinical activities during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including site closures and restrictions on site visits, and we may similarly experience such challenges in our current or future clinical trials.\n\u25cf We currently rely on third parties to, among other things, manufacture and repair key elements of the Viveve System. If any such third parties in our supply chain for materials are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including staffing shortages, production slowdowns and disruptions in delivery systems, our supply chain may be disrupted.\n\u25cf Health regulatory agencies globally may experience disruptions in their operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies may have slower response times or be under-resourced to continue to monitor our clinical trials and, as a result, review, inspection, and other timelines may be materially delayed. For example, in April 2020, the FDA stated that its New Drug Program was continuing to meet program user fee performance goals, but due to many agency staff working on COVID-19 activities, it was possible that the FDA would not be able to sustain that level of performance indefinitely. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur. Any elongation or de-prioritization of our clinical trials or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect the development and study of the Viveve System.\n\u25cf The trading prices for our common stock and other medical device companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital through sales of our common stock or such sales may be on unfavorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our commercial activities, manufacturing operations and clinical development progress, data and timelines, and general business operations, could be delayed or materially harmed, and our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations would suffer as a result.\nWe currently have limited sales and marketing resources or experience and failure to build and manage a sales force or to market and distribute the Viveve System effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur sales and marketing organization is structured so that we rely on a direct sales force to sell the Viveve System in the United States. However, in the first quarter of 2019, we reorganized and reduced the number of direct sales reps selling our products. Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Company implemented a series of significant cost-cutting actions in the second quarter of 2020, including the furlough of 31 full-time employees throughout the entire organization, designed to reduce expenses and reposition resources to support the Company\u2019s current customers and its pivotal clinical development program for our CMRF technology in the treatment of SUI. These corporate actions included an approximate two-thirds reduction of the direct sales organization. We believe our reorganization in 2019 and the operational changes implemented in 2020 related to the COVID-19 crisis will help reduce our operating expenses. We do not currently anticipate making any significant changes to our international distribution network.\nOur reorganization and other operational changes may not have the desired effect of reducing our operating expenses and may result in a disruption to our business, adversely affect our sales and marketing organization and make it more difficult to retain qualified personnel. In addition, our management may divert a disproportionate amount of time away from its day-to-day activities to devoting a substantial amount of time to managing the reorganization which may increase our expenses. Our future financial performance and ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage the reorganization and future growth. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u25cf\nhire qualified individuals as needed;\n\u25cf\nprovide adequate training for the effective sale of our device; and\n\u25cf\nretain and motivate sales employees.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks, which could harm our financial results and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCompetition among providers of devices for the medical device and aesthetics markets is characterized by rapid innovation, and we must continuously innovate technology and develop new products, or our revenue may decline.\nWhile we attempt to protect our technology through patents and other intellectual property rights, there are few barriers to entry that would prevent new entrants or existing competitors from developing products that compete directly with our products. For example, while we believe our monopolar RF technology maintains a strong intellectual property position, there may be other companies employing competing technologies which claim to have a similar clinical effect to our technology. Additionally, there are others who may market monopolar RF technology for competing purposes in a direct challenge to our intellectual property position. As we continue to create market demand for a non-surgical, non-invasive way to treat vaginal laxity, sexual function, and SUI competitors may enter the market with other products making similar or superior claims. We expect that any competitive advantage we may enjoy from our current and future innovations may diminish over time, as companies successfully respond to our innovations, or create their own. Consequently, we believe that we will have to continuously innovate and improve our technology or develop new products to compete successfully. If we are unable to develop new products or innovate successfully, the Viveve System could become obsolete and our revenue will decline as our customers purchase competing products.\nWe outsource the manufacturing and repair of key elements of the Viveve System to manufacturing partners.\nWe outsource the manufacture and repair of our Viveve System to contract manufacturing partners including Stellartech and Spartronics. If any of their operations are interrupted or if they are unable to meet our delivery requirements due to capacity limitations or other constraints, we may be limited in our ability to fulfill new customer orders or to repair equipment at current customer sites, and we may be required to seek new manufacturing partners in the future. Our manufacturing partners have limited manufacturing capacity, are themselves dependent upon third-party suppliers and are dependent on trained technical labor to effectively repair components making up the Viveve System. In addition, they are medical device manufacturers and are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d). If they or any future manufacturing partner fails to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, their manufacturing and repair operations could be halted. In addition, both the availability of our product to support the fulfillment of new customer orders as well as our ability to repair those products installed at current customer sites would be impaired. Viveve and its manufacturing partners operate under manufacturing and supply agreements, however our manufacturing operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to enforce their performance under these agreements, or enter into new agreements with them, or a potential new manufacturer, if necessary, upon favorable terms or at all.\nWe outsource the manufacture and repair of our single-use treatment tips to manufacturing partners including Cirtec. If their operations are interrupted or if they are unable to meet our delivery requirements due to capacity limitations or other constraints, we may be limited in our ability to fulfill new customer orders or to repair equipment at current customer sites, and we may be required to seek new manufacturing partners in the future. Our manufacturing partners have limited manufacturing capacity, are themselves dependent upon third-party suppliers and are dependent on trained technical labor to effectively manufacture the single-use treatment tips. In addition, they are medical device manufacturers and are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s QSR. If they or any future manufacturing partner fails to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, their manufacturing and repair operations could be halted. In addition, both the availability of our product to support the fulfillment of new customer orders as well as our ability to repair those products installed at current customer sites would be impaired. Viveve and its manufacturing partners operate under long term forecasts and purchase orders, however our single-use treatment tip manufacturing operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to enforce their performance or enter into a new agreement with a potential new manufacturer, if necessary, upon favorable terms or at all.\nOur manufacturing operations and those of our key manufacturing subcontractors are dependent upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.\nThe single source supply of each generation of the Viveve System from Stellartech and Spartronics could not be replaced without significant effort and delay in production. Also, several other components and materials that comprise our device are currently manufactured by a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. In many of these cases, we have not yet qualified alternate suppliers and we rely upon purchase orders, rather than long-term supply agreements. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond our current suppliers\u2019 capabilities could harm our ability to manufacture the Viveve System until new sources of supply are identified and qualified. Our reliance on these suppliers subjects us to a number of risks that could harm our business, including:\n\u25cf\ninterruption of supply resulting from modifications to or discontinuation of a supplier\u2019s operations;\n\u25cf\ndelays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects, reliability issues or a supplier\u2019s variation in a component;\n\u25cf\na lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components with our suppliers;\n\u25cf\ninability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner, or to obtain adequate supply on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our components in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\nproduction delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers, and corresponding regulatory qualifications;\n\u25cf\ndelay in delivery due to suppliers prioritizing other customer orders over our orders;\n\u25cf\ndamage to our brand reputation caused by defective components produced by our suppliers;\n\u25cf\nincreased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement based upon defects in components produced by our suppliers; and\n\u25cf\nfluctuation in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or from their other customers.\nAny interruption in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain substitute components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf, in the future, we decide to perform additional manufacturing functions internally that we currently outsource, our business could be harmed by our limited manufacturing experience and related capabilities.\nIn the future, for financial or operational purposes, we may elect to perform component or system manufacturing functions internally. Our limited experience with manufacturing processes could lead to difficulties in producing sufficient quantities of manufactured items that meet our quality standards and that comply with applicable regulatory requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. In addition, if we experience these types of manufacturing difficulties, it may be expensive and time consuming to engage a new or previous subcontractor or supplier to fulfill our replacement manufacturing needs. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business.\nOur business could be harmed by our limited repair experience and related capabilities because we have implemented certain internal repair functions and we may, in the future, decide to perform additional internal repair functions internally that we currently outsource.\nViveve has implemented in-house repair services for common field failure modes for the Viveve system. This is limited to component or board level replacement where the replacement components are supplied by the original manufacturer. This reduces the risk of being able to obtain repair service on a timely basis but adds additional risk related to training and competence of our internal personnel to perform such training.\nIf the Viveve System malfunctions or if we discover a manufacturing defect that could lead to a malfunction, we may have to initiate a product recall or replace components, which could adversely impact our business.\nProblems in our manufacturing processes, or those of our manufacturers or subcontractors, which lead to an actual or possible malfunction in any of the components of our device, may require us to recall product from customers or replace components and could disrupt our operations. Our results of operations, reputation and market acceptance of our products could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in manufacturing that result in a more significant issue or significant patient injury and delays our ability to fill customer orders.\nWe may not be able to develop an alternative cooling module that will be in compliance with changing environmental regulations in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nOur cooling module relies upon a HFC called R134a, to protect the outer layer of the tissue from over-heating while the device delivers RF energy to the submucosal tissue. New environmental regulations phasing out HFCs over the next decade have been adopted or are under consideration in a number of countries. Since 2007, European Union directives aimed at the automotive industry require the phase-out of HFCs and prohibit the introduction of new products incorporating HFCs and it is currently anticipated that such directives may impact the medical device industry. In anticipation of future restrictions, we have qualified a more environmentally friendly HFC (1234ZE) for use in our generators. We do not anticipate that we will have to incur costs in the near future to develop an alternative cooling module for our device which is not dependent on HFCs. However, the impending restrictions on HFCs have reduced their current availability, as suppliers have less of an incentive to expand production capacity or maintain existing capacity. This change in supply could expose us to supply shortages or increased prices for R134a and 1234ZE, which could impair our ability to manufacture our device and adversely affect our results or operations. HFCs may also be classified by some countries as a hazardous substance and, therefore, subject to significant shipping surcharges that may negatively impact profit margins.\nAs a result, if we are unable to develop an alternative cooling module for our device which is not dependent on HFCs in a timely or cost-effective manner, the Viveve System may not be in compliance with environmental regulations, which could result in fines, civil penalties and the inability to sell our products in certain major international markets.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers and third-party manufacturers, and if they are unable or unwilling to continue to work with us, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers and third-party manufacturers. Our reliance on them increases our risk since in the event of an interruption from one or more of them, we may not be able to develop alternative resources without incurring additional costs or delays.\nWe forecast sales to determine requirements for components and materials used in Viveve procedures, and if our forecasts are incorrect, we may experience delays in shipments or increased inventory costs.\nWe keep limited materials, components and finished product on hand. To manage our manufacturing operations with our suppliers, we forecast anticipated product orders and material requirements to predict our inventory needs up to twelve months in advance and enter into purchase orders on the basis of these requirements. Our limited historical experience may not provide us with enough data to accurately predict future demand. If our business expands, our demand for components and materials would increase and our suppliers may be unable to meet our demand. If we overestimate our component and material requirements, we will have excess inventory, which would increase our expenses. If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt, delay or prevent delivery of the Viveve System to our customers. Any of these occurrences would negatively affect our financial performance and the level of satisfaction that our customers have with our business.\nEven though we require training for users of the Viveve System, there exists a potential for misuse, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nOutside of the U.S., our independent distributors sell in many jurisdictions that do not require specific qualifications or training for purchasers or operators of the Viveve System. We do not supervise the procedures performed with the device, nor can we be assured that direct physician supervision of our equipment occurs according to our recommendations. We and our distributors require purchasers of our device to undergo an initial training session as a condition of purchase, but do not require ongoing training. In addition, we prohibit the sale of the device to companies that rent it to third parties, but we cannot prevent an otherwise qualified physician from contracting with a rental company in violation of his or her purchase agreement with us.\nIn the U.S., current federal regulations allow us to sell our device to \u201clicensed practitioners.\u201d The definition of \u201clicensed practitioners\u201d varies from state to state. As a result, the Viveve System may be operated by licensed practitioners with varying levels of training, and in many states by non-physicians, including physician assistants, registered nurses and nurse practitioners. Thus, in some states, the definition of \u201clicensed practitioner\u201d may result in the legal use of the Viveve System by non-physicians. In all instances, training of sites is performed by highly qualified Viveve Medical and Science Liaisons.\nThe use of our device by non-physicians, as well as noncompliance with the operating guidelines set forth in our training programs, may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation.\nProduct liability suits could be brought against us due to defective design, labeling, material or workmanship, or misuse of the Viveve System, and could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages and an increase in our insurance rates.\nIf the Viveve System is defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contains defective components or is misused, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Misusing the device or failing to adhere to operating guidelines could cause serious adverse events. In addition, if our operating guidelines are found to be inadequate, we may be subject to liability. We may, in the future, be involved in litigation related to the use of the device. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us. We may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all future claims. We may not be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry and reduce product sales. Product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage would be paid out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and adversely affecting our operating results.\nAfter-market modifications to treatment tips by third parties and the development of counterfeit products could reduce our sales, expose us to product liability litigation and dilute our brand quality.\nThird parties may introduce adulterated after-market modifications to our treatment tips, which enable re-use of treatment tips in multiple procedures. Because the treatment tips are designed to withstand a finite number of pulses, modifications intended to increase the number of pulses could result in patient injuries caused by the use of worn-out or damaged treatment tips. In addition, third parties may seek to develop counterfeit products that are compatible with the Viveve System and available to practitioners at lower prices. If security features incorporated into the design of the device are unable to prevent after-market modifications to the treatment tips or the introduction of counterfeit products, we could be subject to reduced sales, product liability lawsuits resulting from the use of damaged or defective goods and damage to our reputation.\nThird parties may also try to sell the Viveve System and its consumable products on a secondary market, which would remove Viveve\u2019s ability to track the products. If prior to or after being sold on the secondary market, the Viveve System or its consumable products are misused or modified by a third party, Viveve could be subject to liability. If this happens, we could be subject to reduced sales, product liability claims, inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future and damage to our reputation.\nA data breach or cyberattack affecting our devices, information technology systems, or protected data could expose us to regulatory liability and litigation and dilute our brand quality.\nOur information technology systems and the Viveve System, like other medical devices with software that may be accessible in some manner to users, are vulnerable to security breaches, cyberattacks, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. We also collect, manage, and process protected personal information, including health information, in connection with our operations. A significant breach, attack, or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, regulatory inquiries, litigation, problems with product functionality, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties. We invest in systems and technology and in the protection of our products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption. However, there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to our information technology systems and the Viveve System. Additionally, Viveve products have no WiFi nor do they contain a receiver or transmitter, dramatically reducing the risk of a cyberattack. However, there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to our information technology systems and the Viveve System.\nWe depend on skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business effectively. If we are unable to recruit, hire and retain these employees, our ability to manage and expand our business will be harmed, which would impair our future revenue and profitability.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our officers and other key employees. While we have employment contracts with our Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration (Principal Accounting and Financial Officer), these officers and other key employees may terminate their employment at any time. The loss of any senior management team members could weaken our management expertise and harm our business.\nOur ability to retain our skilled labor force and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future. We may not be able to meet our future hiring needs or retain existing personnel. We will face particularly significant challenges and risks in hiring, training, managing and retaining engineering and sales and marketing employees, as well as independent distributors, most of whom are geographically dispersed and must be trained in the use of our device and benefits of the Viveve System and treatment. Failure to attract and retain personnel, particularly technical and sales and marketing personnel, would materially harm our ability to compete effectively and grow our business.\nAny acquisitions or in-licenses that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe expect to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies. We may also consider joint ventures and other collaborative projects, including in-license opportunities. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or strategic partners, or successfully negotiate, finance or integrate acquisitions of any businesses, products or technologies, as applicable, on favorable terms or at all. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition or in-license and management of any collaborative project may divert management\u2019s time and resources from our business and disrupt our operations. We do not have any experience with acquiring companies or products or in-licensing of technologies. If we decide to expand our product offerings, we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenues. Our inability to identify and secure such opportunities may harm our financial condition and our ability to compete and grow our business.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations which could affect our ability to realize tax benefits from our net operating losses.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $194.0 million and $144.3 million, respectively, due to prior period losses. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d can be subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. While the Company has not performed a formal study, we believe that the Company experienced a change in control in November 2019, which will result in expiration of $81.0 million and $109.6 million of federal and state NOLs, respectively, before utilization. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from past ownership changes, including in connection with this offering. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. In addition, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), the amount of future NOLs that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, where taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL deduction itself. In addition, the Tax Act generally eliminates the ability to carry back any future NOL to prior taxable years, while allowing unused future NOLs to be carried forward indefinitely. There is a risk that due to changes under the Tax Act, regulatory changes, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability.\nWe will need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nDeveloping our products is expensive, and we expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities. We will continue to require substantial funds to support our clinical trials and fund our efforts to expand regulatory clearance or approval for our products, including in the U.S.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents were $19.2 million. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next nine months through December 2022; however we will continue to require funds to fully implement our plan of operation. Additionally, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates. Raising funds in the current economic environment may present additional challenges. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations.\nAny additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidate or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any product candidate or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that our Company will continue as a going concern. We have incurred net losses and used significant cash in operating activities since inception. We have an accumulated deficit of approximately $241.9 million, cash and cash equivalents of $19.2 million and working capital of $17.7 million as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, the Company used $12.9 million in cash for operations in the year ended December 31, 2021. These factors raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern and satisfy our estimated liquidity needs 12 months from the issuance of the financial statements.\nIf we continue to experience operating losses, and we are not able to generate additional liquidity through a capital raise or other cash infusion, we might need to secure additional sources of funds, which may or may not be available to us. Additionally, a failure to generate additional liquidity could negatively impact our ability to operate our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIntellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection for the Viveve System, which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively.\nWe rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and Viveve treatment. We have an exclusive license (with a field of use limitation) to one issued U.S. patent and own 8 issued U.S. patents. Additionally, as of March 11, 2022, we have 7 pending U.S. patent applications; 74 issued foreign patents, including patents that may have lapsed; and 6 pending foreign patent applications. Some of the Viveve System\u2019s components are not, and in the future may not be, protected by patents. Additionally, our patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Any patents we obtain may be challenged, invalidated or legally circumvented by third parties. Consequently, competitors could market products and use manufacturing processes that are substantially similar to, or superior to, ours. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees or current employees, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. Moreover, we do not have patent rights in all foreign countries in which a market may exist, and where we have applied for foreign patent rights, the laws of many foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.\nIn addition, competitors could purchase the Viveve System and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected so as to defend our market against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position and business could be adversely affected.\nWe have been involved in and may be involved in future costly intellectual property litigation, which could impact our future business and financial performance.\nOur industry has been characterized by frequent intellectual property litigation. Our competitors or other patent holders may assert that our device and the methods we employ are covered by their patents. If our device or methods are found to infringe, we could be prevented from marketing the Viveve System. In addition, we do not know whether our competitors or potential competitors have applied for, or will apply for or obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, sell, import or export the Viveve System. We may also initiate litigation against third parties to protect our intellectual property that may be expensive, protracted or unsuccessful. In the future there may be companies that market products for competing purposes in direct challenge to our intellectual property position, and we may be required to initiate litigation in order to stop them. For example, in October 2016 we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against ThermiGen, LLC, ThermiAesthetics, LLC and Dr. Red Alinsod alleging unauthorized use of certain of our patented technologies. based on Viveve\u2019s U.S. Patent Number 8,961,511 (the \u201c\u2018511 patent\u201d). Viveve, Inc. v. ThermiGen, LLC et al., No. 2:16-cv-1189-JRG (E.D. Tx.), filed October 16, 2016. On October 20, 2017, ThermiGen and ThermiAesthetics filed two petitions for inter partes review (IPR) of the \u2018511 patent at the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) challenging the validity of the \u2018511 patent claims. ThermiGen, LLC et al. v. Viveve, Inc., No. IPR2018-00088 (October 20, 2017) and ThermiGen, LLC et al. v. Viveve, Inc., No. IPR2018-00089 (October 20, 2017). On June 4, 2018, we entered into a Settlement and License Agreement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) with ThermiGen LLC and ThermiAesthetics LLC (\u201cThermiGen,\u201d collectively) as well as Red Alinsod, M.D. resolving our patent litigation against ThermiGen and Dr. Alinsod. The Settlement Agreement also resolved ThermiGen\u2019s IPR proceedings against the Viveve.\nLitigation related to infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable, can be expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business. If we lose this kind of litigation, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, and prohibit us from using technologies essential to the Viveve System and Viveve treatment, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In that event, we do not know whether necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, or whether we could redesign the Viveve System or processes to avoid infringement.\nCompeting products may also appear in other countries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit, we could be prevented from marketing the Viveve System in one or more countries.\nIn addition, we may hereafter become involved in litigation to protect our trademark rights associated with our device name or treatment name. Names used may be claimed to infringe names held by others or to be ineligible for proprietary protection. If we have to change the name of the Company, device or treatment, we may experience a loss in goodwill associated with our brand name, customer confusion and a loss of sales.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nPublic company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules implemented by the SEC have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. As a public company, these rules and regulations increase our compliance costs and make certain activities more time consuming and costly. These rules and regulations may also make it more difficult and expensive for us to maintain our director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers, and to maintain insurance at reasonable rates, or at all.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\nAs of March 11, 2022, our officers, directors and principal stockholders, i.e., stockholders who beneficially own greater than 10% of our outstanding common stock, collectively beneficially own approximately 5.6% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, will be able to control the management and affairs of our company and most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nWe are a holding company with no business operations of our own and we depend on cash flow from Viveve, Inc. to meet our obligations.\nWe are a holding company with no business operations of our own or material assets other than the stock we own in Viveve, Inc. All of our operations are conducted by Viveve, Inc. As a holding company, we will require dividends and other payments from our subsidiary to meet cash requirements. The terms of any agreements governing indebtedness that we may enter into may restrict our subsidiary from paying dividends and otherwise transferring cash or other assets to us. If there is an insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of our subsidiary, our stockholders likely will have no right to proceed against its assets. Creditors of our subsidiary will be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of our subsidiary before we, as an equity holder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from that sale or disposal. If Viveve, Inc. is unable to pay dividends or make other payments to us when needed, we will be unable to satisfy our obligations.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u25cf\nsuccess of competitors;\n\u25cf\nour operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our business, the market for our products, the health services industry, or the healthcare and health insurance industries in general;\n\u25cf\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf\nour ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u25cf\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u25cf\nthe volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;\n\u25cf\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u25cf\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, fluctuations in interest rates and international currencies, and global conflicts such as the war in Ukraine.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur shares of common stock are thinly traded, the price may not reflect our value, and there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future.\nOur shares of common stock are thinly traded, our common stock is held by a small number of holders, and the price may not reflect our actual or perceived value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business, among other things. We will take certain steps including utilizing investor awareness campaigns, investor relations firms, press releases, road shows and conferences to increase awareness of our business. Any steps that we might take to bring us to the awareness of investors may require that we compensate consultants with cash and/or stock. There can be no assurance that there will be any awareness generated or the results of any efforts will result in any impact on our trading volume. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business, and trading may be at a depressed price relative to the performance of the Company due to, among other things, the availability of sellers of our shares. If an active market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there is currently a relatively low per-share price for our common stock, many brokerage firms or clearing firms are not willing to effect transactions in the securities or accept our shares for deposit in an account. Many lending institutions will not permit the use of low-priced shares of common stock as collateral for any loans.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144, or shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d and, in anticipation of which, the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nIn general, under Rule 144, a non-affiliated person who has held restricted shares of our common stock for a period of six months may sell into the market all of their shares, subject to the Company being current in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future, except the cumulative dividend payable on our Series B Preferred Stock, which could reduce a return in your investment in us. We intend to retain any earnings to develop, carry on, and expand our business. In addition, the terms of the indebtedness of our existing credit facility also restrict us from paying cash dividends to stockholders under some circumstances. The terms of our Series B Preferred Stock also provide that we may not pay dividends on our common stock without concurrently declaring dividends on each. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if you sell our common stock after our stock price appreciates.\nCRG has the right to acquire a significant percentage of our stock upon conversion of its Series B Preferred Stock and exercise of its warrants and is able to exert significant control over matters pursuant to the protective provisions therein as well as the covenants and other restrictions in the Loan Agreement.\nAffiliates of CRG LP (collectively \u201cCRG\u201d) have the right to acquire approximately 14% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis, subject to stockholder approval to authorize a sufficient number of common stock, Nasdaq stockholder approval requirements and beneficial ownership restrictions contained in the Series B Certificate of Designation and warrants held by CRG. Even though Series B Preferred Stock is non-voting stock, and has beneficial ownership restrictions, the Series B Certificate of Designation has protective provisions that will require CRG\u2019s consent to perform certain significant company events. For example, CRG's consent would be necessary to amend our organizational documents, or approve any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This consent requirement could delay or prevent any acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. CRG may have interests different than yours. For example, CRG may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference to our common stock.\nSeries B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference that gets paid prior to any payment on our common stock (including shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants). As a result, if we were to dissolve, liquidate, merge with another company or sell our assets, the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock would have the right to receive up to approximately $35.82 million plus any unpaid dividend from any such transaction before any amount is paid to the holders of our common stock or pursuant to the redemption rights in the warrants for fundamental transactions. The payment of the liquidation preferences could result in common stockholders and warrant holders not receiving any consideration if we were to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\nThe existence of the liquidation preferences may reduce the value of our common stock, make it harder for us to sell shares of common stock in offerings in the future, or prevent or delay a change of control. Furthermore, any conversion of Series B Preferred Stock into common stock will cause substantial dilution to our common stockholders.\nIf we fail to comply with ongoing Nasdaq listing standards and corporate governance requirements, we could be subject to delisting. Nasdaq delisting could materially adversely affect the market for our shares.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain this listing, we are required to comply with various continued listing standards, including corporate governance requirements, set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. These standards and requirements include, among other things, (1) an obligation to maintain a Board of Directors, a majority of whom are deemed to be independent and that we maintain an Audit Committee consisting of at least three independent Board Members, (2) an obligation that our listed securities maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and (3) an obligation to maintain Nasdaq\u2019s threshold market value of listed securities (or comply with its alternative stockholders\u2019 equity requirement).\nIn the past, we have been in non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price requirement, Audit Committee independence requirement and market value of listed securities requirement, but we cured our deficiencies and regained compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards. Furthermore, as of March 16, 2022, the bid price of our common stock has closed below $1.00 per share for 22 consecutive trading days. In the event that the bid price of our common stock remains below such threshold for 30 consecutive trading days, we may receive a notice of non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price requirement and grace period to regain compliance. In such an event, we may need to effect a reverse stock split to regain compliance. Nasdaq may also decline to continue our listing on account of multiple reverse stock splits for compliance with its minimum bid price requirement. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards in the future.\nIn the event that our common stock is not eligible for continued listing on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by security analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a major exchange.", "PERMNO": 16112, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "VIVE"}
