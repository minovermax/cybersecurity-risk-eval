RISK FACTORS.\nThis report contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, our forward-looking statements. Words such as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates\u201d or other similar expressions and future or conditional verbs such as \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwould\u201d and \u201ccould\u201d are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Readers of this report should not rely solely on the forward-looking statements and should consider all uncertainties and risks throughout this report. The statements are representative only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\nAll forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual future results may differ materially from those set forth in our forward-looking statements. We face risks that are inherent in the businesses and the market places in which we operate. While management believes these forward-looking statements are accurate and reasonable, uncertainties, risks and factors, including those described below, could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements.\nFactors that may cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: (i) the failure to complete the Merger and the effects such failure would have on the Company's financial condition and results of operations, (ii) certain business uncertainties and contractual restrictions related to the pendency of the Merger, (iii) our inability to pursue alternatives to the Merger during the pendency of the Merger, (iv) adverse economic conditions could impact our ability to realize operating plans if the demand for our products declines, and such conditions could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to continue to operate and could cause a write down of long-lived assets or goodwill; (v) an increase in the cost or a decrease in the\navailability of our principal or single-sourced purchased raw materials; (vi) changes in the competitive environment; (vii) uncertainty of the timing of customer product qualifications in heavily regulated industries; (viii) economic, political, or regulatory changes in the countries in which we operate; (ix) difficulties, delays, or unexpected costs in completing the Company\u2019s restructuring plans; (x) acquisitions and other strategic transactions expose us to a variety of risks, including the ability to successfully integrate and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with applicable regulations; (xi) our business could be negatively impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation; (xii) difficulties associated with retaining, attracting, and training effective employees and management; (xiii) the need to develop innovative products to maintain customer relationships and offset potential price erosion in older products; (xiv) exposure to claims alleging product defects; (xv) the impact of laws and regulations that apply to our business, including those relating to environmental matters, data protection, cyber security and privacy; (xvi) the impact of international laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices; (xvii) changes impacting international trade and corporate tax provisions related to the global manufacturing and sales of our products may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; (xviii) volatility of financial and credit markets affecting our access to capital; (xix) default or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses; (xx) the need to reduce the total costs of our products to remain competitive; (xxi) potential limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset possible future taxable income; (xxii) restrictions in our debt agreements that could limit our flexibility in operating our business; (xxiii) failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting; (xxiv) service interruption, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security as it relates to our information systems could cause a disruption in our operations, financial losses, and damage to our reputation; (xxv) economic and demographic experience for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans could be less favorable than our assumptions; (xxvi) fluctuation in distributor sales could adversely affect our results of operations; (xxvii) earthquakes, natural disasters, and climate change could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; (xxviii) global health epidemics such as the coronavirus could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations; and (xxix) volatility in our stock price.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those included, contemplated or implied by the forward-looking statements made in this report, and the reader should not consider the above list of factors to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nCompletion of the merger with Yageo Corporation is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including regulatory and stockholder approvals, if required, and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay or otherwise adversely affect its completion in a material way. For example, the Merger cannot be consummated until, among other things, the approval required from the Investment Commission, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan. Likewise, completion of the Merger is subject to (i) the approval of Yageo\u2019s stockholders, if required by law, (ii) the absence of any applicable restraining order or injunction prohibiting the Merger, and, (iii) in the case of Yageo\u2019s obligations to complete the Merger, there not having been any \u201cmaterial adverse effect.\u201d\nWe can provide no assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the Merger. Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within either our or Yageo\u2019s control, and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any delay in completing the Merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price;\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from our customers, vendors and employees;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to pay Yageo a termination fee of $63.8 million if the Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if we accept a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Agreement);\n\u2022\nwe will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, including legal, accounting, investment banking and advisory fees, whether or not the Merger is completed;\n\u2022\nwe will have been bound by certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Merger, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of Yageo, which may prevent us from making certain acquisitions or taking certain other specified actions during the pendency of the Merger; and\n\u2022\nour management team will have devoted substantial time and resources to matters relating to the Merger (including integration planning), and would otherwise have devoted their time and resources to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on our employees and officers may have an adverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, as employees and officers may experience uncertainty about their future roles. Additionally, the pendency of the Merger could cause those that deal with us to delay or defer certain business decisions, seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or seek alternative relationships with others.\nIn addition, the Agreement generally requires us to, and to cause our subsidiaries to, subject to specified exceptions, conduct our business in the ordinary course and use reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve intact our respective business organizations, employees and key business relationships. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities that arise prior to the effective time of the Merger and are outside the ordinary course of business. Under the Agreement we also are subject to certain specific restrictions on our corporate and business activity during the pendency of the Merger, including without limitation the ability in certain cases to enter into or amend contracts, dispose of assets, incur indebtedness, pay dividends, incur capital expenditures or settle claims. Such limitations could adversely affect our business and operations prior to completion of the Merger.\nThe Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us.\nThe Agreement contains a non-solicitation covenant that makes it more difficult for the Company to be acquired by, or enter into certain combination transactions with, a third party. Such non-solicitation covenant, subject to certain limitations, restricts our ability to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiry, discussion, offer or request any proposal to enter into an alternative transaction, or to engage or participate in any negotiations or discussions or enter into certain agreements in furtherance of an alternative transaction. These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring or combining with all or a significant portion of the Company or pursuing an alternative transaction from considering or proposing such a transaction.\nAdverse economic conditions could impact our ability to realize operating plans if the demand for our products declines; and such conditions could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to continue to operate and could cause the write down of long-lived assets or goodwill.\nWhile our operating plans provide for cash generated from operations to be sufficient to cover our future operating requirements, many factors, including reduced demand for our products, currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased raw material costs, and other adverse market conditions we cannot predict could cause a shortfall in net cash generated from operations. As an example, the electronics industry is a cyclical industry with demand for capacitors reflecting the demand for products in the electronics market. Customers\u2019 requirements for our capacitors fluctuate as a result of changes in general economic activity and other factors affecting the demand for their end-products. During periods of increasing demand for their products, they typically seek to increase their inventory of our products to avoid production bottlenecks. When demand for their products peaks and begins to decline, they may rapidly decrease orders for our products while they use accumulated inventory. Business cycles vary somewhat in different geographical regions, such as Asia, and within customer industries. We are also vulnerable to general economic events beyond our control and our sales and profits may suffer in periods of weak demand.\nOur ability to realize operating plans is also dependent upon meeting our payment obligations. If cash generated from operating, investing and financing activities is insufficient to pay for operating requirements and to cover interest payment obligations under debt instruments, planned operating and capital expenditures may need to be reduced.\nAdditionally, long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. Also, goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. In the event the tests show the carrying value of certain long-lived assets, intangible assets, or goodwill are impaired, we would be required to take additional impairment charges to earnings under U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. However, such charges would have no direct effect on our cash. If the economic conditions decline we could incur additional impairment charges in the future.\nAn increase in the cost or decrease in the availability of our principal or single-sourced purchased raw materials could adversely affect profitability.\nThe principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products include tantalum powder, tantalum ore, palladium, aluminum, silver, copper, nickel and tin. These materials are considered commodities and are subject to price volatility. Additionally, any delays in obtaining raw materials for our products could hinder our ability to manufacture our products, negatively impacting our competitive position and our relationships with our customers.\nTantalum is mined principally in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Rwanda. As a result of our tantalum vertical integration program which began in fiscal year 2012, we have reduced our exposure to price volatility and supply uncertainty in the tantalum supply chain. Our tantalum ore supply requirements are now met through our direct sourcing partners of conflict free tantalum, which is then processed into the intermediate product potassium heptafluorotantalate (commonly known as K-salt) at our own facility in Mexico or at third party locations, before final processing into tantalum powder at KBP operations in Matamoros, Mexico. However, price increases for tantalum ore, or for the remaining tantalum powder that we source from third parties, could impact our financial performance as we may not be able to pass all such price increases on to our customers.\nSilver and aluminum have generally been available in sufficient quantities, and we believe there are enough suppliers from which we can purchase our requirements. An increase in the price of silver and aluminum that we are unable to pass on to our customers, could, however, have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nChanges in the competitive environment could harm our business.\nThe capacitor business is competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers. Competition is based on factors such as product quality and reliability, availability, customer service, technical innovation, timely delivery and price. The industry has become increasingly consolidated and global in recent years, and our primary U.S. and non-U.S. competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources. The greater financial resources of such competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions. Some competitors may also have the ability to use profits from other operations to subsidize losses sustained in their businesses with which we compete. Certain competitors may also develop product or service innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.\nUncertainty of the timing of customer product qualifications in heavily regulated industries could affect the timing of product revenues and profitability arising from these industries.\nOur capacitors are incorporated into products used in diverse industries. Certain of these industries, such as military, aerospace and medical, are heavily regulated, with long and sometimes unpredictable product approval and qualification processes. Due to such regulatory compliance issues, there can be no assurances as to the timing of product revenues and profitability arising from our product development and sales efforts in these industries.\nWe manufacture many capacitors in Europe, Mexico and Asia and economic, political or regulatory changes in any of these regions could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur international operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the same risks as our domestic business. These risks include currency exchange rate fluctuations, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory regimes, differences in the availability and terms of financing, political instability and potential increases in taxes. These factors could impact our production capability or adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs in completing our restructuring plans and may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring plans.\nWe may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of our restructuring plans without encountering difficulties, which may include complications in the transfer of production knowledge, loss of key employees and/or customers, the disruption of ongoing business, possible inconsistencies in standards, controls and procedures and potential difficulty in meeting customer demand in the event the market dramatically improves. We are a party to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, which could potentially prevent or delay execution of parts of our restructuring plans.\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions expose us to a variety of operational and financial risks.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions depends, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the acquired companies with our own. Our management devotes significant attention and resources to these efforts, which may disrupt the business of each of the companies involved and, if executed ineffectively, could preclude realization of the full benefits we expect. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the operations of the acquired company. In addition, the efforts required to realize the benefits of our acquisitions may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention, and may cause our stock price to decline.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and failure to timely integrate acquired businesses into our Company\u2019s operating and internal control structures may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdditionally, we may finance acquisitions or future payments with cash from operations, additional indebtedness and/or the issuance of additional securities, any of which may impair the operation of our business or present additional risks, such as reduced liquidity or increased interest expense. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges. We may also seek to restructure our business in the future by disposing of certain of our assets, which may harm our future operating results, divert significant managerial attention from our operations and/or require us to accept non-cash consideration, the market value of which may fluctuate.\nFurthermore, expansions or acquisitions into new geographic markets and services may require us to comply with new and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements, which could impose substantial obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such requirements. Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation that may negatively impact our business.\nThe growth of our Company and our expansion into a variety of new products expose us to a variety of new regulatory issues, and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown. We are subject to various federal, foreign and state laws, including antitrust laws, violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions. Furthermore, as a result of our acquisition of TOKIN, we assumed all liabilities assessed against TOKIN that may arise as a result of litigation to which TOKIN is a party. Refer to \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for a summary of the Company's material litigation and investigations. The impact of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, train or retain key employees, management or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, it could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and certain other employees, many of whom have many years of experience with us and would be extremely difficult to replace. We must also attract and retain experienced and highly skilled engineering, sales and marketing and managerial personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense in our industry, and we may not be successful in hiring and retaining these people. If we lost the services of our executive officers or our other highly qualified and experienced employees or cannot attract and retain other qualified personnel, our business could suffer through less effective management due to loss of accumulated knowledge of our business or through less successful products due to a reduced ability to design, manufacture and market our products.\nWe must continue to develop innovative products to maintain relationships with our customers and to offset potential price erosion in older products.\nWhile most of the fundamental technologies used in the passive components industry have been available for a long time, the market is nonetheless characterized by rapid changes in product designs and technological advances allowing for better performance, smaller size and/or lower cost. New applications are frequently found for existing technologies, and new technologies occasionally replace existing technologies for some applications or create new business opportunities in other areas of application. We believe successful innovation is critical for avoiding product redundancy or obsolescence caused by changes in technology; for maintaining profitability to offset potential erosion of selling prices for existing products; and to ensure the flow of new products and robust manufacturing processes that will keep us at the forefront of our customers\u2019 product designs. Non-customized products are especially vulnerable to price pressure, but customized products have also experienced price pressure in recent years. Developing and marketing new products requires start-up costs that may not be recouped if these products or production techniques are not successful. There are numerous risks inherent in product development, including the risks we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or we will be unable to develop and market new\nproducts and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands. If this occurs, we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to claims alleging product defects.\nOur business exposes us to claims alleging product defects or nonconformance with product specifications. We may be held liable for, or incur costs related to, such claims if any of our products, or products in which our products are incorporated, are found to have caused end market product application failures, product recalls, property damage or personal injury. Provisions in our customer and distributor agreements are designed to limit our exposure to potential material product defect claims, including warranty, indemnification, waiver and limitation of liability provisions, but such provisions may not be effective under the laws of some jurisdictions. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product defect claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, defect claims could entail substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management personnel.\nOur insurance program may not be adequate to cover all liabilities arising out of product defect claims and, at any time, insurance coverage may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If liability coverage is insufficient, a product defect claim could result in liability to us, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Even if we have adequate insurance coverage, product defect claims, or recalls could result in negative publicity or force us to devote significant time and attention to those matters.\nVarious laws and regulations that apply to our business, including those relating to conflict minerals and environmental matters, could limit our ability to operate as we are currently and could result in additional costs.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations of national, state and local authorities in the countries in which we operate regarding a wide variety of matters, including conflict minerals, environmental, employment, land use, antitrust, and others that affect the day-to-day operations of our business. The liabilities and requirements associated with the laws and regulations that affect us may be costly and time-consuming. There can be no assurance we have been or will be at all times in compliance with such applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting our operations. If we are pursued for sanctions, costs or liabilities in respect of these matters, our operations and, as a result, our profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe SEC requires issuers for whom tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by such person to conduct certain diligence procedures and make certain disclosures annually regarding whether any of those minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. As defined by the SEC, tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold are commonly referred to as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d or \u201c3TG\u201d. If an issuer\u2019s conflict minerals originated in those countries, the rule requires the issuer to submit a report to the SEC that includes a description of the measures it took to exercise due diligence on the conflict minerals\u2019 source and chain of custody. We use tantalum, tin and, to a lesser degree, other of the 3TG minerals in our production processes and in our products. We have exercised due diligence on the source and chain of custody during the reporting period and, as required under the rule, annually disclose a description of these measures and certain of our findings in a special disclosure on Form SD. Disclosure in accordance with the rule may cause changes to the pricing of 3TG minerals, which could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, it is possible some of our disclosures pursuant to the rule related to our inquiries and supply chain custody diligence could cause reputational harm and cause the company to lose customers or sales.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local, as well as foreign, environmental laws and regulations relating, among other things, to wastewater discharge, air emissions, handling of hazardous materials, disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. We use a number of chemicals or similar substances and generate waste that are considered hazardous. We are required to hold environmental permits to conduct many of our operations. Violations of environmental laws and regulations could result in substantial fines, penalties, and other sanctions. Changes in environmental laws or regulations (or in their enforcement) affecting or limiting, for example, our chemical uses, certain of our manufacturing processes, or our disposal practices, could restrict our ability to operate as we are currently operating or impose additional costs. In addition, we may experience releases of certain chemicals or discover existing contamination, which could cause us to incur material cleanup costs or other damages.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. United States laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d), the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) and the trade and trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (\u201cOFTR\u201d) and the United States Department of the\nTreasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). The import and export of our products from each of our United States and international manufacturing facilities and distribution hubs are subject to international trade agreements, the modification or repeal of which could impact our business. We must comply with the requirements of OFTR and non-U.S. trade representative offices to benefit from existing trade agreements. EAR restricts the export of dual-use products and technical data to certain countries, while ITAR restricts the export of defense products, technical data and defense services. The U.S. government agencies responsible for administering EAR and ITAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations. We also cannot provide services to certain countries subject to United States trade sanctions unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from OFAC. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws that, generally, bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials.\nViolations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges, loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business and criminal penalties and may harm our ability to enter contracts with customers who have contracts with the U.S. government. A violation of the laws or the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges impacting international trade and corporate tax provisions related to the global manufacturing and sales of our products may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and China. Our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and we also rely on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market and sell our products globally. Changes in trade treaties and corporate tax policy could impact U.S. trade relations with other countries such as Mexico, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nVolatility of financial and credit markets could affect our access to capital.\nUncertainty in the global financial and credit markets could impact our ability to implement new financial arrangements or to modify our existing financial arrangements. An inability to obtain new financing or to further modify existing financing could adversely impact the execution of our restructuring plans and delay the realization of the expected cost reductions. Our ability to generate adequate liquidity will depend on our ability to execute our operating plans and to manage costs in light of developing economic conditions. An unanticipated decrease in sales, or other factors that would cause the actual outcome of our plans to differ from expectations, could create a shortfall in cash available to fund our liquidity needs. Being unable to access new capital, experiencing a shortfall in cash from operations to fund our liquidity needs and the failure to implement an initiative to offset the shortfall in cash would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDefault by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.\nAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with a financial institution. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing any related financial institution's insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default by or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must consistently reduce the total costs of our products to remain competitive.\nOur industry is intensely competitive and prices for existing products tend to decrease steadily over their life cycle. There is substantial and continuing pressure from customers to reduce the total cost of capacitors. To remain competitive, we must achieve continuous cost reductions through process and product improvements.\nWe must also be in a position to minimize our customers\u2019 shipping and inventory financing costs and to meet their other goals for rationalization of supply and production. Our growth and the profit margins of our products will suffer if our competitors are more successful in reducing the total cost to customers of their products than we are. We must also continue to introduce new products that offer performance advantages over our existing products and can thereby achieve premium prices, offsetting the price declines in our more mature products.\nOur use of net operating losses to offset possible future taxable income could be limited by ownership changes.\nIn addition to the general limitations on the carryback and carryforward of net operating losses under Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), Section 382 of the Code imposes further limitations on the utilization of net operating losses by a corporation following ownership changes which result in more than a 50-percentage point change in ownership of a corporation within a three-year period. If Section 382 applies, the post-ownership change utilization of our net operating losses may be subject to limitation for federal income tax purposes related to regular and alternative minimum tax. While we do not believe we have experienced an ownership change to date, the application of Section 382 of the Code now or in the future could limit a substantial part of our future utilization of available net operating losses. Such limitation could require us to pay substantial additional income taxes and adversely affect our liquidity and financial position.\nEven if we have not experienced an ownership change to date, we could experience an ownership change in the near future if there are significant purchases of our common stock or other events outside our control.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur debt agreements contain various covenants that, subject to exceptions, may limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; create liens on assets; make capital expenditures; engage in mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; sell assets (including pursuant to sale leaseback transactions); pay dividends and distributions on or repurchase capital stock; make investments (including acquisitions), loans, or advances; prepay certain junior indebtedness; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into restrictive agreements; amend material agreements governing certain junior indebtedness; and change lines of business. The agreement governing our revolving credit facility also includes a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant that we must satisfy if an event of default occurs or in the event we do not meet certain excess availability requirements under our revolving credit facility. Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which may be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs disclosed in Part II - Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of our fiscal year 2019 Form 10-K in the section \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,\u201d a material weakness was identified in our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2019 resulting from certain control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting pertaining to the initiation and recording of net sales and accounts receivable, net. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weakness identified at March 31, 2019 in Item 9A did not result in any misstatements of the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements for any periods presented. When the material weakness was identified, we promptly developed and implemented a comprehensive remediation plan to address this material weakness, which included implementing new, and refining existing, controls, as well as providing additional training and improving our documentation as it pertains to the initiation and recording of net sales and accounts receivable. Based on these measures, management has concluded that the material weakness described above has been remediated as of March 31, 2020.\nThere is a risk that in the future the Company could have another material weakness, fail to maintain effective controls, or timely implement any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls. This could, among other things, result in losses from errors, harm our reputation or cause investors to lose confidence in the reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security, our operations could be disrupted, we may suffer financial losses, and our reputation may be damaged.\nAs a global company we rely on networks and information systems and other technology (\u201cinformation systems\u201d), including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support our business. Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our information systems, including matters related to\nsystem and data security, reliability, compliance or performance could have an adverse effect on our business including our results of operation and timeliness of financial reporting.\nBecause information systems are critical to many of the Company's operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches. These incidents may be caused by failures during routine operations such as system upgrades or by user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, cyberattacks by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social-activist (hacktivist) organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events. In addition, such incidents could result in unauthorized or accidental disclosure of material confidential information of the Company or its customers, or regulated individual personal data. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments for products. The loss or disclosure of misappropriated confidential information could have the following implications: loss of intellectual property, disruption to key business operations, and diversion of management\u2019s attention from key business operations and key informational technology resources. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems\nIn addition, we are subject to federal defense procurement regulations relating to the effectiveness of our cybersecurity operations, and to laws, rules, and regulations in the U.S., U.K., European Union, and other countries relating to the collection, use, and security of user data. Our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors, customers, or employees of a data security breach, potentially damaging our brand and reputation. If we fail to comply with applicable federal, state, or international cybersecurity, privacy-related, or data protection laws or regulations, we may incur a loss of business (including defense-related business) and/or penalties or significant legal liability or be subject to proceedings by government entities.\nIf economic and demographic experience for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are less favorable than our assumptions (e.g., discount rates or return on investments), then it may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants. We use many assumptions in calculating these estimates, including assumptions related to discount rates, return on investments on designated plan assets, and demographic experience (e.g. mortality and retirement rates). To the extent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, there could be a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For instance, significant decreases in market interest rates could lead to increases in annual pension expense. Further, decreases in the value of plan assets could lead to an increased use of cash for plan contributions. For discussion of our assumptions, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 7 and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.\nSales to distribution channel customers may fluctuate and adversely affect our results of operations.\nFrom time-to-time, if end customer demand decreases, our sales to distributors also decrease while the distributors reduce their inventory levels. In addition, a single customer, a distributor, accounted for over 10% of our net sales in each of fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018. If our relationship with this customer were to terminate, we would need to determine alternative means of delivering our products to the end-customers served by it.\nEarthquakes, natural disasters, and climate change could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSeveral of our facilities in Japan are located in regions that could be subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Our production facilities located in Japan are in areas with above average seismic activity and some have been affected by other natural disasters such as tsunami. If any of our facilities in Japan or elsewhere were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or other natural disaster, such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments, and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities. While KEMET has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement, such insurance would not cover all possible losses. In addition, our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans (including those relating to our information technology systems) may not be fully responsive to, or minimize losses associated with, catastrophic events.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the responses thereto taken by various governmental authorities throughout the world.\nThe novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) identified in China in late 2019 has spread throughout the world and in response governmental authorities have ordered mandatory shut-downs of non-essential business, quarantines, travel-bans and shelter-in-place orders. The spread of COVID-19 and the governmental responses to it have negatively impacted our business by, among other things, forcing us to temporarily suspend our manufacturing operations at certain locations and forcing our non-manufacturing employees to work remotely. As of March 31, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 and governmental responses did not have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are modifying our business practices in response to COVID-19 to ensure the health and safety of our employees; however we may in the future be forced to temporarily shut down one or more of our facilities if any of our workers test positive for COVID-19 or any of our facilities or the services provided at those facilities are not deemed to be \u201cessential\u201d under applicable government shut-down orders or are otherwise not considered exempt from government-imposed shut-down orders for any reason. In addition, governmental guidelines in response to COVID-19 may limit our workforce to a certain number of employees per shift or cause us to modify our operations in other ways that could be disruptive to our business. Any such temporary shut-down, limitation on our workforce, or other government-imposed modification of our operations could have a significant impact on the production of our products. Additionally, COVID-19 may cause some of our suppliers to fail to deliver the quantities of supplies we need or fail to deliver such supplies in a timely manner. The failure to receive any such supplies could inhibit our ability to run our manufacturing operations and otherwise operate our business. Additionally, our ability to transport our products could be impaired by disruptions in our global transportation network resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the continued spread of COVID-19 has led to increased volatility in the global capital markets. Such volatility increases the cost of, and decreases access to, capital. If the Company needs to access the capital markets to fund its operations, such capital could be prohibitively expensive which could cause the Company to pursue alternative sources of funding for its operations and working capital.\nAs a result of COVID-19, our employees, contractors, and consultants are working remotely and it is possible that this could have a negative impact on the execution of our business plans and operations. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in consumer privacy, IT security, and fraud concerns, as well as increase our exposure to potential wage and hours issues.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information concerning the severity of the outbreak and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate its effects. The effects of COVID-19 have led to a global economic slowdown and while we expect this matter to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition in the future, the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. As of March 31, 2020, the effects of COVID-19 have not had a significant impact on the Company's liquidity. The Company will continue to take appropriate steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile historically. Our stock price may be significantly affected by factors including those described elsewhere in \"Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" as well as the following:\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in our operating results compared to market expectations;\n\u2022\ninvestors' perceptions of the electronic component industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe composition of our stockholders, particularly the presence of \"short sellers\" trading our stock; and\n\u2022\na decline in our credit rating.", "PERMNO": 78001, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "KEM"}
