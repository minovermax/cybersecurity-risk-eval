{"cik": "744187", "company": "REX AMERICAN RESOURCES Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe encourage you to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX common stock. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock could decline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment.\nWe have concentrations of cash deposits at financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits.\nWe generally have cash deposits that exceed federal insurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash in experience insolvency or other financial difficulty, our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nThe current interest rate environment has resulted in lower yields on our excess cash.\nWe have experienced lower yields on our excess cash compared to historical yields. Should the present economic conditions result in a sustained period of historically low interest rates, our interest income would be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to our Alternative Energy Business\nThe ethanol industry is changing rapidly which could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations.\nAccording to the RFA, the ethanol industry has grown from approximately 1.5 billion gallons of domestic annual ethanol production in 1999 to approximately 15.3 billion gallons in 2016. Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanol over a relatively short period of time which could lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants.\nWe operate in a capital intensive industry. Limitations to external financing could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may need to incur additional financing to fund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Bankruptcy filings by several ethanol companies in past years and capital market volatility has reduced available capital for the ethanol industry. Any delays in obtaining additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe financial returns on our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty, and the availability of supplies, so our results could fluctuate substantially.\nThe financial returns on our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, natural gas, ethanol, dried distillers grains, non-food grade corn oil and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, the returns may fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasing costs for their raw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants.\nOur returns on ethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices. Corn is the principal raw material our ethanol plants use to produce ethanol and co-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affect our businesses. Rising corn prices result in higher production costs of ethanol and co-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plants may not be able to pass along increased grain costs to our customers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical to produce.\nThe price of corn is influenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports, the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include government policies and subsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relative effect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the supply of corn, such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants. Increasing domestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. Much of the Midwestern United States experienced drought conditions during 2012 which led to a smaller harvest of corn and increased corn prices. Our ethanol plants may also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn on economical terms due to regional supply shortages. Such a shortage could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.\nThe spread between ethanol and corn prices can vary significantly. The gross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spread between ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur. A sustained narrow or negative spread, whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants.\nOur risk management strategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity. In an attempt to partially offset the impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol and distillers grains production and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements. The financial impact of these risk management activities is dependent upon, among other items, the prices involved and our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved. Risk management activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchased in a declining market or when positions are sold in an increasing market. In addition, we may not be able to match the appropriate quantity of corn contracts with quantities of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil contracts. We vary the amount of risk management techniques we utilize, and we may choose not to engage in any risk management activities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodities prices, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe market for natural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants use in their manufacturing process. Our ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas, which is consumed as fuel in the production process. The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants\u2019 control, such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair or completely prevent the ethanol plants\u2019 ability to economically manufacture ethanol for their customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants.\nFluctuations in the selling price of commodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesser extent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and our ethanol plants\u2019 results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand or prices decrease.\nDistillers grains compete with other protein based animal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. The prices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which their products are made. Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instances when the price increase for distillers grains has lagged price increases in corn prices.\nThe production of distillers grains has increased as a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines in what we can sell our distillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have an adverse material effect on our results of operations.\nIncreased ethanol production or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may cause the price of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease.\nAccording to the RFA, domestic ethanol production capacity is approximately 16.0 billion gallons per year at January 2017. The RFA estimates that, as of January 2017, approximately 91 million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction or expansion. In addition, certain operating plants have qualified as efficient ethanol producers through the EPA pathway assessment, and are expanding, or planning to expand their capacity. The EPA set the RFS requirement to be satisfied by corn derived ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons for 2017. The Trump administration imposed a government wide freeze on new and pending regulations which includes the 2017 RFS requirement. The freeze expired on March 21, 2017 with no change to the previously announced requirement. Excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations. In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit, without regard for interest, overhead or fixed costs). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs.\nExcess capacity may also result from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory developments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices for gasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage or acquire hybrid vehicles.\nIn addition, because ethanol production produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as co-products, increased ethanol production will also lead to increased supplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanol plants\u2019 distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-food grade corn oil could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.\nThe price of ethanol and distillers grains may decline as a result of trade restrictions or duties on ethanol and distillers grains exports from the United States or from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.\nExports of distillers grains produced in the United States have been increasing in recent years. However, the export market may be jeopardized if foreign governments impose trade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign local markets. In January 2016, the China Ministry of Commerce announced it has initiated anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations of U.S. dried distillers grains exports to China. China also announced it has established anti-dumping duties on imports of U.S. dried distillers grains that range from 42.2% to 53.7% and also established countervailing duties that range from 11.2% to 12%. If producers and exporters of distillers grains are subjected to trade barriers when selling distillers grains to foreign customers, there may be a reduction in the price of distillers grains in the United States. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce the demand for United States exports of distillers grains. Declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability to operate our ethanol plants profitably.\nThe United States exported approximately one billion gallons of ethanol in 2016. If producers and exporters of ethanol are subject to trade restrictions, or additional duties are imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to export ethanol. China raised its 5% tariff on U.S. fuel ethanol to 30%, effective January 1, 2017. Furthermore, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce the demand for United States ethanol exports. This could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the United States which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.\nFuture demand for ethanol is uncertain and changes in overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand.\nThere are limited markets for ethanol other that what is federally mandated. Increased consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuel is likely necessary in order for ethanol to achieve significant market share growth beyond federal mandate levels.\nWe depend on our partners to operate certain of our ethanol investments.\nOur investments currently represent both majority and minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the local farmers\u2019 cooperative or investor group that has promoted the plant. We do not have the ability to directly modify the operations of these plants in response to changes in the business environment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants. In addition, local plant operators, who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of corn and other crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant. The limitations on our ability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations.\nWe may not successfully acquire or develop additional ethanol investments.\nThe growth of our ethanol business depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals, and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders, financial institutions, marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants, and a material disruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments.\nAny expansion strategy will depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectations of future market conditions. There is increasing competition for suitable sites for ethanol plants. Even if suitable sites or opportunities are identified, we may not be able to secure the services and products from contractors, engineering firms, construction firms and equipment suppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economic terms. Construction costs may increase to levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable to operate. Additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or available on acceptable terms. New and more stringent environmental regulations could increase the operating costs and risks of new plants, which, in turn could discourage us from further expansion. In addition, failure to adequately manage the risks associated with additional ethanol investments could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ethanol plants may be adversely affected by technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful.\nThe development and implementation of new technologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advances in the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive, cellulosic sources such as corn stalk, wheat, oat or barley straw could have an adverse effect on our ethanol plants, because those facilities are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, by comparison, a raw material with other high value uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rate of acceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the development of alternatives to ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol.\nAny advances in technology which require significant unanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.\nIn addition, alternative fuels, additives and oxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, which may decrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performance could reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol, and the results of our ethanol operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependent upon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nThe Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) established RFS II, which modified the renewable fuel standard from prior legislation. EISA increased the amount of renewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline and required a minimum usage of corn derived renewable fuels of 12.0 billion gallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015. The EPA has the authority to assign the mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be blended into transportation fuel to individual fuel blenders. RFS II has been a primary factor in the growth of ethanol usage. Over the past several years various pieces of legislation have been introduced to the U.S. Congress that were intended to reduce or eliminate ethanol blending requirements. Most recently, on January 3, 2017, the Leave Ethanol Volumes at Existing Levels (\u201cLEVEL\u201d) Act (H.R. 119) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill would freeze renewable fuel blending requirements under the RFS at 7.5 billion gallons per year, prohibit the sale of gasoline containing more than 10% ethanol, and revoke the EPA\u2019s approval of E15 blends. On January 31, 2017, a bill (H.R. 777) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill would require the EPA and National Academies of Sciences to conduct a study on the implication of the use of mid-level ethanol blends. A mid-level ethanol blend is an ethanol gasoline blend containing 10-20% ethanol by volume, including E15 and E20, that is intended to be used in any conventional gasoline powered motor vehicle or non-road vehicle or engine. On March 2, 2017, a bill (H.R. 1315) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that would limit the volume of ethanol in gasoline to 10%. On the same day, the RFS Elimination ACT (H.R. 1314) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill would fully repeal the RFS.\nUnder EISA, the EPA has the authority to waive or modify the mandated RFS II requirements in whole or in part. In order to grant a waiver, the EPA administrator must determine in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that one of the following two conditions has been met: i) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or ii) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the country. During fiscal year 2012, several waiver requests were submitted to the EPA based on drought conditions, which were subsequently denied by the EPA.\nThe RFS II mandate increased to 14.4 billion gallons of corn derived renewable fuel for 2014 and 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 and was to remain at that level until 2022, subsequent to which time, no specific amount was established. In November of 2013, the EPA released a proposal that included several approaches for establishing the 2014 standards. The proposal was for approximately 15.2 billion gallons, including approximately 13.0 billion gallons of corn derived renewable fuel. The proposal addresses two constraints of RFS II: i) limitations in the volume of ethanol that can be consumed in gasoline given the practical constraints on the supply of higher ethanol blends to the vehicles that can use them and ii) limitations in the ability of the industry to produce sufficient volumes of qualifying renewable fuel. In November 2014, the EPA rescinded its 2013 proposal. Furthermore, the EPA did not finalize the 2014 standard under the RFS program before the end of that year.\nOn November 30, 2015, the EPA announced final volume requirements for conventional ethanol of 13.61 billion gallons, 14.05 billion gallons and 14.50 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In November 2016, the EPA announced the 2017 requirement of 15.0 billion gallons for conventional renewable fuels which equals the original statutory requirement. The Trump administration imposed a government wide freeze on new and pending regulations which includes the 2017 RFS requirement. The freeze expired on March 21, 2017 with no change to the previously announced requirement.\nOn January 18, 2017, Valero Energy Corporation filed an action against the EPA to compel the EPA to perform certain duties required by the Clean Air Act. The filed action claims that the EPA has failed to perform these duties, principally, periodic reviews of the feasibility of achieving compliance with the requirements and impact of the requirements on each individual and entity regulated under the program since 2010.\nSeveral amendments to the Energy Policy Modernization Act were introduced in the U.S. Senate that were removed from consideration in February 2016, including amendments to repeal RFS II, eliminate the corn ethanol mandate in RFS II and prohibit the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture from using Commodity Credit Corporation or other funds to construct blender pumps.\nTo document compliance with RFS II, renewable identification numbers (\u201cRINs\u201d), are generated and attached to renewable fuels, and detached when the renewable fuel is blended into the transportation fuel supply. Detached RINs may be retired by obligated parties to demonstrate compliance with RFS II or may be separately traded in the market. The market price of detached RINs may affect the price of ethanol in certain U.S. markets as obligated parties may factor these costs into their purchasing decisions. Moreover, at certain price levels for various types of RINs, it becomes more economical to import foreign sugar cane ethanol. If changes to RFS II result in significant changes in the price of various types of RINs, it could negatively affect the price of ethanol and our ethanol business. Furthermore, in November 2016, the EPA proposed denying a petition to change the point of obligation under RFSII to the parties that own the gasoline before it is sold. The point of obligation does not directly impact ethanol producers; however, moving the point of obligation could indirectly affect ethanol producers.\nThe inability to generate or obtain RINs could adversely affect our operating results. Virtually all of our ethanol is sold with RINs that are used by customers to comply with RFS II. If our production does not meet EPA requirements for RIN generation in the future, we would have to purchase RINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at substantially lower prices to adjust for the absence of RINs. The price of RINs varies based on many factors and cannot be predicted. Failure to obtain sufficient RINS or reliance on invalid RINs could subject us to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA.\nChanges in corporate average fuel economy standards could adversely impact ethanol prices. Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meeting federally mandated corporate average fuel economy (\u201cCAFE\u201d) standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers. High blend ethanol fuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would not likely build flexible-fuel vehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices.\nVarious studies have criticized the efficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffs that promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel.\nAlthough many trade groups, academics and governmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanol production as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depleting water resources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheat grain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs from livestock that consume corn to increase. If these views gain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of these measures. These views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel.\nFederal support of cellulosic ethanol may result in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers.\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and EISA provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrass and poplar trees. The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of production of non-corn derived biofuels. These federal policies may suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks such as switchgrass, silage or wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint and is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market. Several cellulosic ethanol plants are under development and there is a risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas with limited alternative feedstock nearby, and would require significant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. The adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business.\nOur ethanol business is affected by environmental and other regulations which could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants.\nOur ethanol production facilities are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate our plants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental or which increase our costs. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operating costs or require us to expend considerable resources.\nOur ethanol plants emit various airborne pollutants as by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program. We believe our plants are grandfathered at their current operating capacity, but plant expansion will need to meet a 20% threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS II mandate. To expand our plant capacity, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technology equipment, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other steps in order to comply with future laws or regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations of carbon dioxide, or if we choose to expand capacity at certain of our plants, compliance with then-current regulations of carbon dioxide, could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably, which may have a negative impact on our financial performance. We also face the risk of ethanol production above our grandfathered capacity not qualifying for RINS if the plants do not meet certain emission requirements.\nThe California Air Resources Board (\u201cCARB\u201d) has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (\u201cLCFS\u201d) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuels by 2020. An Indirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. After a series of rulings that temporarily prevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of California Office of Administrative Law approved the LCFS on November 26, 2012 and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013. This standard could have an adverse impact on the market for corn-based ethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions. This could have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nOur ethanol business may become subject to various environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities.\nOperations of our ethanol business will expose the business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failure to comply with environmental regulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissions of other persons. Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows.\nOur business is not significantly diversified.\nOur financial results depend heavily on our ability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. We do not have other lines of business or other sources of revenue to depend upon if we are unable to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Such lack of significant diversification could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operate unprofitably.\nWe may have commitments to produce and sell ethanol.\nWe may, at times, sell our products with forward contracts. If we are unable to produce the products due to economical conditions, business interruption, or other factors, we may incur additional costs or have to obtain commodities at unfavorable prices. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur revenue from the sale of distillers grains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed.\nDistillers grains is a co-product from the fermentation of corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination; therefore antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards from the use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If the public became concerned about the impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillers grains could be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may not be able to obtain a suitable replacement for antibiotics, should this be required, which would also negatively impact the market for distillers grains.\nExports of distillers grains produced in the United States have been increasing in recent years. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from the increased exports of the product, with China being the largest importer. In 2013, China rejected certain shipments of distillers grains due to the presence of unapproved genetically modified organisms. If shipments to China or other countries are rejected or delayed, the market price for distillers grains would be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our ethanol results of operations.\nAt certain of our plants, we extract and sell non-food grade corn oil immediately prior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are trying to determine how non-food grade corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determined that non-food grade corn oil extraction adversely impacts the nutritional energy content of distillers grains, the value of the distillers grains we sell may be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe face significant competition in the ethanol industry.\nWe face significant competition for new ethanol investment opportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry. Some enterprises provide financial and management support similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants which they will directly own and operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development of ethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy.\nThe ethanol industry is primarily comprised of entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanol along with their base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If these companies increase their ethanol plant ownership or other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, there would be less of a need to purchase ethanol from independent producers like our ethanol plants.\nPlants sold as part of a bankruptcy proceeding may have significantly lower fixed costs than our ethanol plants. Absent significant growth and diversification, our ethanol plants may not be able to operate profitably in a more competitive environment. No assurance can be given that our ethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resources will not have a materially adverse impact on the results of our ethanol operations.\nWe may face competition from foreign companies.\nThere is a risk of foreign competition in the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil\u2019s ethanol production is sugarcane based, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce. Under the RFS, certain parties were obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane based ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to comply with this standard.\nIf significant additional foreign ethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lower prices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These risks could have significant adverse effects on our financial performance.\nIn addition, the tariff that protected the U.S. ethanol industry expired at the end of 2011. The expiration of the tariff could lead to increases in the import of ethanol produced outside of the U.S.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers.\nThe inability of a customer to make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to make our payments when due.\nWe may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants.\nOur ability to attract and retain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for key plant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Failure to do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants.\nOur plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy and water to operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business.\nOur plants require a significant and uninterrupted supply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If there is an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we are unable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A production halt for an extended period of time could result in material losses.\nPotential business disruption from factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, strikes, unexpected equipment failures and unforeseen plant shutdowns, could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results.\nThe debt agreements for certain of the ethanol plants limit, or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments the ethanol subsidiaries can transfer to their members.\nWe are dependent on dividends from our ethanol subsidiaries to generate cash flow. Presently our unconsolidated ethanol subsidiary has debt agreements that limit payments to members. Therefore, this company cannot distribute all of the cash it generates to its members. Furthermore, we may not be able to use the excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs of another operating ethanol subsidiary.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology could harm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accounting and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause delays in product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financial results. Significant capital investments could be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietary data could also adversely impact our reputation, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties.\nWe are exposed to potential business disruption from factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, and unforeseen operational failures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adversely affect our cash flows and operating results.\nPotential business disruption in available transportation due to natural disasters, severe weather conditions, significant track damage resulting from a train derailment, strikes or other interruptions by our transportation providers could result in delays in procuring and supplying raw materials to our ethanol facilities, or transporting ethanol and distillers grains to our customers. Such business disruptions may result in our inability to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements, as well as the potential loss of customers.\nRail cars used to transport ethanol may need to be modified or replaced to meet proposed rail safety regulations.\nThe leased rail cars we use to transport ethanol to market will need to be retrofitted or replaced as the Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operation Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) calls for an enhanced tank car standard known as the DOT specification 117 and establishes a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol. The rule also establishes braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. This could lead to increased rail car lease costs and delays in transportation of ethanol if rail cars are out of service for extended periods of time.\nRisks Related to our eSteam investments and operations.\neSteam may not be commercially viable technology.\nDuring fiscal year 2013, we invested in eSteam, a new technology utilizing steam to extract deep heavy oil. Cumulatively, we have spent approximately $1.7 million on this patented but unproven technology. Low energy and crude oil prices may make eSteam technology less attractive to potential users. To date, we have not tested or proven the viability of the technology. If we cannot demonstrate that the technology is commercially feasible, we may incur additional losses.\nOur eSteam technology may be subject to patent challenges.\nWe could be required to spend considerable time and resources defending our technology from patent challenges.\nOperations utilizing our eSteam technology may be subject to stringent environmental regulations.\nThese operations will require significant amounts of water and energy. If we are unable to obtain the proper permits and sources of water and energy, then we may not be able to operate the new technologies, and thus, generate any revenue.\nOperations utilizing our eSteam technology may cause environmental damage.\nWhen operating the eSteam technology, we may cause environmental damage, as we would be injecting water into the ground in order to extract oil. We could be subject to significant penalties and fines if we were to cause environmental damage.", "PERMNO": 68830, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "REX"}
