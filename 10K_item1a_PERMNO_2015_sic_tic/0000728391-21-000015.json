RISK FACTORS\nInvestors should consider carefully the following risk factors that could cause our business, operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected. We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance. The categories of risk we have identified in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" include risks associated with our operations, governmental regulation and laws, our indebtedness and financial condition. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning IPALCO and IPL set forth in the Notes to the Financial Statements and in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d herein. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS\nOur electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and/or maintenance expenses, increased fuel or purchased power costs and other significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.\nWe operate coal, oil and natural gas generating facilities, which involve certain risks that can adversely affect energy costs, output and efficiency levels. These risks include:\n\u2022unit or facility shutdowns due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes;\n\u2022increased prices for fuel and fuel transportation as existing contracts expire or as such contracts are adjusted through price re-opener provisions or automatic adjustments;\n\u2022disruptions in the availability or delivery of fuel and lack of adequate inventories;\n\u2022shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment;\n\u2022loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste generated by the facilities;\n\u2022accidents and injuries;\n\u2022reliability of our suppliers;\n\u2022inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements;\n\u2022operational restrictions resulting from environmental or permit limitations or governmental interventions;\n\u2022construction delays and cost overruns;\n\u2022disruptions in the delivery of electricity;\n\u2022labor disputes or work stoppages by employees;\n\u2022the availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022events occurring on third party systems that interconnect to and affect our system;\n\u2022operator error; and\n\u2022catastrophic events.\nThe above risks could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and/or maintenance expenses, increased capital expenditures and/or increased fuel and purchased power costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These risks are partially mitigated by our ability to generally pass fuel and purchased power costs through to customers through the Fuel Adjustment Charge (\u201cFAC\u201d). If unexpected plant outages occur frequently and/or for extended periods of time, this could result in adverse regulatory action.\nAdditionally, as a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation industry, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks.\nThe hazardous activities described above can also cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is adequate, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A successful claim for which we are not fully insured could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, except for our large substations, transmission and distribution assets are not covered by insurance and are considered to be outside the scope of property insurance. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any such losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has adversely affected, and it or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases could materially and adversely affect, our generation facilities, transmission and distribution systems, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has caused disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and financial markets and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues of an as yet unknown magnitude and duration.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has since spread to over 150 countries, including every state in the U.S. On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020 the U.S. declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted global economic activity, caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets and reduced the demand for energy in our service territory. In addition to reduced revenues and lower margins resulting from decreased energy demand within our service territory, we also have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses relating to COVID-19, including expenses relating to events outside of our control. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and many countries, including the U.S., have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures as well as restricting travel. In addition to triggering a period of global economic slowdown or a global recession, COVID-19 or another pandemic could have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to, among other factors:\n\u2022further decline in customer demand as a result of general decline in business activity;\n\u2022further destabilization of the markets and decline in business activity negatively impacting our customer growth or the number of customers in our service territory as well as our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our services when due (or at all);\n\u2022delay or inability in obtaining regulatory actions and outcomes that could be material to our business, including for recovery of COVID-19 related expenses and losses, such as uncollectible customer amounts, and the review and approval of our applications, rates and charges by the IURC;\n\u2022difficulty accessing the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets, or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions which could affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis;\n\u2022negative impacts on the health of our essential personnel, especially if a significant number of them are affected, and on our operations as a result of implementing stay-at-home, quarantine and other social distancing measures;\n\u2022a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption, including increased cybersecurity attacks related to the work-from-home environment;\n\u2022delays or inability to access, transport and deliver fuel or other materials to our facilities due to restrictions on business operations or other factors affecting us and our third-party suppliers;\n\u2022the inability to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from availability and cost of fuel and other commodities that experience significant volatility;\n\u2022delays or inability to access equipment or the availability of personnel to perform planned and unplanned maintenance, which can, in turn, lead to disruption in operations;\n\u2022delays or inability in achieving our financial goals, growth strategy and digital transformation; and\n\u2022delays in the implementation of expected rules and regulations.\nWe continue to review and modify our plans as conditions change. Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the Company, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of this outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects.\nCOVID-19 continues to present material uncertainty which could materially and adversely affect our generation facilities, transmission and distribution systems, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, such as those relating to our level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.\nWe may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or a decline in the number of customers or in customer usage.\nCustomer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as energy efficiency and DSM measures, population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. A lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers in our service territory or in customer demand for electricity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and may cause us to fail to fully realize anticipated benefits from investments and expenditures.\nThe availability and cost of fuel and other commodities have experienced and could continue to experience significant volatility and we may not be able to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from availability and price volatility. In addition, a significant amount of our electricity is generated by coal.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in the price of coal, natural gas, purchased power and emissions allowances. In addition, changes in the prices of steel, copper and other raw materials can have a significant impact on our costs. We also are dependent on purchased power, in part, to meet our seasonal planning reserve margins. Any changes in fuel prices could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position with respect to our products and services.\nOur exposure to fluctuations in the price of fuel is limited because, pursuant to Indiana law, we may apply to the IURC for a change in our FAC every three months to recover our estimated fuel costs, which may be above or below the levels included in our basic rates and charges. In addition, we may generally recover the energy portion of our purchased power costs in these quarterly FAC proceedings subject to a benchmark (please see Note 2, \u201cRegulatory Matters - FAC and Authorized Annual Jurisdictional Net Operating Income\u201d to the Financial Statements for additional details regarding the benchmark and the process to recover fuel costs). As part of this cost-recovery process, we must present evidence in each proceeding that we have made every reasonable effort to acquire fuel and generate or purchase power or both so as to provide electricity to our retail customers at the lowest fuel cost reasonably possible. If we are unable to timely or fully recover our fuel and purchased power costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nApproximately 48% of the energy we produced in 2020 was generated by coal as compared to approximately 58% and 69% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. While we have approximately 28% in total of our current coal requirements for the three-year period ending December 31, 2023 under long-term contracts as of the date of this report, the balance is yet to be purchased and will be purchased under a combination of long-term contracts, short-term contracts and on the spot market. Prices can be highly volatile in both the short-term market and on the spot market. The coal market has experienced significant price volatility in the last several years. We are now in a global market for coal in which our domestic price is increasingly affected by international supply disruptions and demand balance. Coal exports from the U.S. have increased significantly at times in recent years. In addition, domestic developments such as government-imposed direct costs and permitting issues that affect mining costs and supply availability, and the variable demand of retail customer load and the performance of our generation fleet have an impact on our fuel procurement operations. In addition, pricing provisions in some of our coal contracts with terms of one year or more allow for price changes under certain circumstances.\nBecause of our dependence on coal to meet customer demand for electricity, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by unexpected price volatility in the coal market, price increases pursuant to the provisions of certain of our long-term coal contracts, and the continued regulatory and political scrutiny of coal. As discussed below, regulators, politicians and non-governmental organizations have expressed concern about GHG emissions and are taking actions which, in addition to the potential physical risk associated with climate change, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our dependence on coal also means that the output of our coal-fired generation units can be greatly affected by the costs of other fuels combusted by generation facilities that compete with our coal-fired generation units. Natural gas prices over the last several years have been relatively low and some gas-fired generators that previously were primarily used during periods of peak and intermediate electric demand have run even during periods of relatively low demand. This has caused many coal-fired generators, including ours, to run fewer hours during these periods of base-load demand.\nIn addition, substantially all of our coal supply is currently mined in the state of Indiana, and all of our coal supply is currently mined by unaffiliated suppliers or third parties. Our current goal is to carry a 25-50 day system supply of\ncoal to offset unforeseen occurrences such as equipment breakdowns and transportation or mine delays. IPL has long-term contracts with two suppliers. In recent years, the coal industry has undergone significant restructuring as a result of debt restructurings, bankruptcy proceedings and other factors. Further restructuring may result in a failure of our suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations or fewer suppliers and, consequently, increased dependency on any one supplier. Any significant disruption in the ability of our suppliers, particularly our most significant suppliers, to mine or deliver coal or other fuel, or any failure on the part of our suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event of disruptions or failures, there can be no assurance that we would be able to purchase power or find another supplier of fuel on similarly favorable terms, which could also limit our ability to recover fuel costs through the FAC proceedings.\nCatastrophic events could adversely affect our facilities, systems and operations.\nCatastrophic events such as fires, explosions, cyber-attacks, terrorist acts, acts of war, pandemic events, or natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, severe winds, ice or snow storms, droughts or other similar occurrences could adversely affect our generation facilities, transmission and distribution systems, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our Petersburg Plant, which is our largest source of generating capacity, is located in the Wabash Valley seismic zone, adjacent to the New Madrid seismic zone, which are both areas of significant seismic activity in the central U.S.\nOur business is sensitive to weather and seasonal variations.\nWeather conditions significantly affect the demand for electric power, and accordingly, our business is affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. As a result of these factors, our operating revenues and associated operating expenses are not generated evenly by month during the year. We forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal weather (such as warmer winters and cooler summers) could have a material impact on our revenue, operating income and net income and cash flows. In addition, severe or unusual weather, such as floods, tornadoes and ice or snow storms, may cause outages and property damage that may require us to incur additional costs that may not be insured or recoverable from customers. While we are permitted to seek recovery of certain severe storm damage costs, if we are unable to fully recover such costs in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur membership in a regional transmission organization presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are a member of MISO, a FERC-regulated regional transmission organization. MISO serves the electrical transmission needs of a 15-state area including much of the Mid-U.S. and Canada and maintains functional operational control over our electric transmission facilities, as well as that of the other utility members of MISO. We retain control over our distribution facilities. As a result of membership in MISO and its operational control, our continued ability to import power, when necessary, and export power to the wholesale market has been, and may continue to be, impacted. We offer our generation and bid our load into this market on a day-ahead basis and settle differences in real time. Given the nature of MISO\u2019s policies regarding use of transmission facilities, and its administration of the energy and ancillary services markets, it is difficult to predict near-term operational impacts. We cannot assure MISO\u2019s reliable operation of the regional transmission system, or the impact of its operation of the energy and ancillary services markets.\nThe rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time which could affect our costs and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may expand or otherwise change our transmission system according to decisions made by MISO in addition to our internal planning process. In addition, various proposals and proceedings before the FERC relating to MISO or otherwise may cause transmission rates to change from time to time. We also incur fees and costs to participate in MISO.\nTo the extent that we rely, at least in part, on the performance of MISO to maintain the reliability of our transmission system, it puts us at some risk for the performance of MISO. In addition, actions taken by MISO to secure the reliable operation of the entire transmission system operated by MISO could result in voltage reductions, rolling blackouts, or sustained system-wide blackouts on IPL\u2019s transmission and distribution system, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See also \u201cItem 1. Business - MISO Operations and \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation - Retail Ratemaking.\u201d\nOur transmission and distribution system is subject to operational, reliability and capacity risks.\nThe ongoing reliable performance of our transmission and distribution system is subject to risks due to, among other things, weather damage, intentional or unintentional damage, equipment or process failure, catastrophic events, such as fires and/or explosions, facility outages, labor disputes, accidents or injuries, operator error, or inoperability of key infrastructure internal or external to us and events occurring on third party systems that interconnect to and affect our system. The failure of our transmission and distribution system to fully operate and deliver the energy demanded by customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and if such failures occur frequently and/or for extended periods of time, could result in adverse regulatory action. In addition, the advent and quick adaptation of new products and services that require increased levels of electrical energy cannot be predicted and could result in insufficient transmission and distribution system capacity. As with all utilities, potential concern with the adequacy of transmission capacity on IPL\u2019s system or the regional systems operated by MISO could result in MISO, the NERC, the FERC or the IURC requiring us to upgrade or expand our transmission system through additional capital expenditures or share in the costs of regional expansion. Also, as a result of the above risks and other potential risks and hazards associated with transmission and distribution operations, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Except for IPL\u2019s large substations, transmission and distribution assets are not covered by insurance and are considered to be outside the scope of property insurance. Otherwise, we maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is adequate, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Further, any increased costs or adverse changes in the insurance markets may cause delays or inability in maintaining insurance coverage on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. A successful claim for which we are not fully insured could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCurrent and future conditions in the economy may adversely affect our customers, suppliers and other counterparties, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been and will continue to be affected by general economic conditions. Slowing economic growth, credit market conditions, fluctuating consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, and other challenges affecting the general economy, have caused and may continue to cause some of our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing customers may reduce their electricity consumption and may not be able to fulfill their payment obligations to us in the normal, timely fashion. In addition, some existing commercial and industrial customers may discontinue their operations. Sustained downturns, recessions or a sluggish economy generally affect the markets in which we operate and negatively influence our energy operations. A contracting, slow or sluggish economy could reduce the demand for energy in areas in which we are doing business. For example, during economic downturns, our commercial and industrial customers may see a decrease in demand for their products, which in turn may lead to a decrease in the amount of energy they require. Furthermore, projects which may result in potential new customers may be delayed until economic conditions improve. Some of our suppliers, customers and other counterparties, and others with whom we transact business experience financial difficulties, which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. For example, our counterparties on forward purchase contracts and financial institutions involved in our credit facility may become unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us or result in their declaring bankruptcy or similar insolvency-like proceedings. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements. Reduced demand for our electric services, failure by our customers to timely remit full payment owed to us and supply delays or unavailability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In particular, the projected economic growth and total employment in Indianapolis are important to the realization of our forecasts for annual energy sales.\nEconomic conditions relating to the asset performance and interest rates of the Pension Plans could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, level of employer contributions, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of our Pension Plans\u2019 assets compared to pension obligations under the Pension Plans. Further, the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust\nto satisfy future obligations under the Pension Plans. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the Pension Plans\u2019 assets will increase the funding requirements under the Pension Plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value in the foreseeable future. Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, may also be subject to changes in legislation. We are responsible for funding any shortfall of our Pension Plans\u2019 assets compared to obligations under the Pension Plans, and a significant increase in our pension liabilities could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We are subject to the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. As a result, our required contributions to these plans, at times, have increased and may increase in the future. In addition, our pension and postemployment benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the discounted liabilities increase benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements for the obligations related to the pension and other postemployment benefit plans. Declines in market values and increased funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Please see Note 9, \u201cBenefit Plans\u201d to the Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nCounterparties providing materials or services may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe enter into transactions with and rely on many counterparties in connection with our business, including for the purchase and delivery of inventory, including fuel and equipment components, for our capital improvements and additions and to provide professional services, such as actuarial calculations, payroll processing and various consulting services. If any of these counterparties fails to perform its obligations to us or becomes unavailable, our business plans may be materially disrupted, we may be forced to discontinue or delay certain operations if a cost-effective alternative is not readily available or we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and cause delays. Although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty, our actual exposure may be greater than the relief provided by these mitigation provisions. Any of the foregoing could result in regulatory actions, cost overruns, delays or other losses, any of which (or a combination of which) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFurther, our construction program calls for extensive expenditures for capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades, improvements to and replacements of generation, transmission and distribution facilities, as well as other initiatives. As a result, we have engaged, and will continue to engage, numerous contractors and have entered into a number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials and/or obtain the required construction related services. In addition, some contracts provide for us to assume the risk of price escalation and availability of certain metals and key components. This could force us to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and cause construction delays. It could also subject us to enforcement action by regulatory authorities to the extent that such a contractor failure resulted in a failure by IPL to comply with requirements or expectations, particularly with regard to the cost of the project. As a result of these events, we might incur losses or delays in completing construction.\nAccidental improprieties and undetected errors in our internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery, noncompliant disclosure or incorrect payment processing.\nOur internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with GAAP, laws and regulations, taxation requirements and federal securities laws and regulations in order to, among other things, disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of our costs and with our reporting requirements under federal securities, tax and other laws and regulations and to properly process payments. We have also implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by management and our Board of Directors. While we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees, temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to improprieties and undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery, noncompliant disclosure\nand reporting or incorrect payment processing. The consequences of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to maintain a qualified and properly motivated workforce, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOne of the challenges we face is to retain a skilled, efficient and cost-effective workforce while recruiting new talent to replace losses in knowledge and skills due to resignations, terminations or retirements. This undertaking could require us to make additional financial commitments and incur increased costs. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we have employee compensation plans that reward the performance of our employees. We seek to ensure that our compensation plans encourage acceptable levels for risk and high performance through pay mix, performance metrics and timing. We also have policies and procedures in place to mitigate potential excessive risk-taking by employees to achieve performance targets which could result in events that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to collective bargaining agreements that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to collective bargaining agreements with employees who are members of a union. Approximately 69% of our employees are represented by a union in two bargaining units: a physical unit and a clerical-technical unit. While we believe that we maintain a satisfactory relationship with our employees, it is possible that labor disruptions affecting some or all of our operations could occur during the period of the collective bargaining agreements or at the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements before new agreements are negotiated. We may not be able to successfully train new personnel as current workers with significant knowledge and expertise retire. We also may be unable to staff our business with qualified personnel in the event of significant absenteeism related to a pandemic illness. Work stoppages by, or poor relations or ineffective negotiations with, our employees or other workforce issues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe use of non-derivative and derivative instruments in the normal course of business could result in losses that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe sometimes use non-derivative and derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity and financial risks. We may at times enter into forward contracts to hedge the risk of volatility in earnings from wholesale marketing activities. These trades are affected by a range of factors, including variations in power demand, fluctuations in market prices, market prices for alternative commodities and optimization opportunities. We have attempted to manage our commodities price risk exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management policies. Despite our efforts, however, these risk limits and management policies may not work as planned and fluctuating prices and other events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these instruments can involve management\u2019s judgment or the use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of some of these contracts. We could also recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, a counterparty failing to perform, or the underlying transactions which the instruments are intended to hedge failing to materialize, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPotential security breaches (including cyber-security breaches) and terrorism risks could adversely affect our businesses.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated systems and network infrastructure at our generation stations, fuel storage facilities and transmission and distribution facilities. We also use various financial, accounting and other systems in our businesses. These systems and facilities are vulnerable to unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, other cyber-security attacks and other causes. In particular, given the importance of energy and the electric grid, there is the possibility that our systems and facilities could be targets of terrorism or acts of war. We have implemented measures to help prevent unauthorized access to our systems and facilities, including network and system monitoring, identification and deployment of secure technologies, and certain other measures to comply with mandatory regulatory reliability\nstandards. Pursuant to NERC requirements, we have a robust cyber-security plan in place and are subject to regular audits by an independent auditor approved by NERC. We routinely test our systems and facilities against these regulatory requirements in order to measure compliance, assess potential security risks, and identify areas for improvement. In addition, we provide cyber-security training for our employees and perform exercises designed to raise employee awareness of cyber risks on a regular basis. To date, cyber-attacks on our business and operations have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. Despite our efforts, if our systems or facilities were to be breached or disabled, we may be unable to recover them in a timely manner to fulfill critical business functions, including the supply of electric services to our customers, and we could experience decreases in revenues and increases in costs that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn the course of our business, we also store and use customer, employee, and other personal information and other confidential and sensitive information, including personally identifiable information and personal financial information. If our or our third-party vendors\u2019 systems were to be breached or disabled, sensitive and confidential information and other data could be compromised, which could result in negative publicity, remediation costs and potential litigation, damages, consent orders, injunctions, fines and other relief.\nTo help mitigate these risks, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses, including coverage for illegal acts against us. However, insurance may not be adequate to protect us against all costs and liabilities associated with these risks.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND LAWS\nWe may not always be able to recover our costs to deliver electricity to our retail customers. The costs we can recover and the return on capital we are permitted to earn for certain aspects of our business are regulated and governed by the laws of Indiana and the rules, policies and procedures of the IURC.\nWe are currently obligated to supply electric energy to retail customers in our service territory. Even though rate regulation is premised on full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the IURC will agree that all of our costs have been prudently incurred or are recoverable. There also is no assurance that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce a full or timely recovery of our costs and authorized return. From time to time, the demand for electric energy required to meet our service obligations could exceed our available electric generating capacity. When our retail customer demand exceeds our generating capacity for units operating under MISO economic dispatch, recovery of our cost to purchase electric energy in the MISO market to meet that demand is subject to a stipulation and settlement agreement. The agreement includes a benchmark which compares hourly purchased power costs to daily natural gas prices. Purchased power costs above the benchmark must meet certain criteria in order for us to fully recover them from our retail customers, such as consideration of the capacity of units available but not selected by the MISO economic dispatch. We may not always have the ability to pass all of the purchased power costs on to our customers, and even if we are able to do so, there may be a significant delay between the time the costs are incurred and the time the costs are recovered. Since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand, the market price for electric energy at the time we purchase it could be very high, and we may not be allowed to recover all of such costs through our FAC. Even if a supply shortage were brief, we could suffer substantial losses that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nChanges in, or reinterpretations of, the laws, rules, policies and procedures that set electric rates, permitted rates of return, changes in IPL\u2019s rate structure, regulations regarding ownership of generation assets and electric service, the supply of generation, reliability initiatives, fuel and purchased power (which account for a substantial portion of our operating costs), capital expenditures and investments and the recovery of these and other costs on a full or timely basis through rates, power market prices and changes to the frequency and timing of rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nConcerns about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our business.\nOne byproduct of burning coal and other fossil fuels is the emission of GHGs, including CO2. At the federal, state and regional levels, policies are under development or have been developed to regulate GHG emissions. In 2020, IPL emitted approximately 10 million tons of CO2 from our power plants. IPL uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by \u201cThe Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u201d reporting standard on GHG emissions. Our CO2\nemissions are determined from emissions monitoring data and calculations using actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors.\nThere currently is no U.S. federal legislation imposing mandatory GHG emission reductions (including for CO2) that affects our electric power generation facilities. However, in 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule establishing NSPS for CO2 emissions for newly constructed and modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled EUSGUs larger than 25 MW, and the EPA proposed revisions to this rule in December 2018. In addition, in July 2019, the EPA published the final ACE Rule along with associated revisions to implementing regulations, which established CO2 emission rules for existing power plants under CAA Section 111(d) and replaced the EPA's 2015 CPP, although the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE Rule in January 2021. In addition, it is likely that there will be increased focus on climate change from a President Biden administration and a Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress, both of which may result in additional legislation and regulations regarding GHG emissions.\nFor further discussion of the regulation of GHG emissions in the U.S., see \"Item 1. Business -Environmental Matters - Climate Change Legislation and Regulation.\"\nIn December 2015, the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change convened for the 21st Conference of the Parties and the resulting Paris Agreement established a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. We anticipate that the Paris Agreement will continue the trend toward efforts to de-carbonize the global economy. Although the U.S. was officially able to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020, on January 20, 2021, President Biden began the 30-day process of rejoining the Paris Agreement, which will become effective for the U.S. on February 19, 2021.\nAny existing or future international, federal, state or regional legislation or regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance. The actual impact on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market-based compliance options are available, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on our ability to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. Our cost of compliance could be substantial. Although we would seek recovery of costs associated with new climate change or GHG regulations, our inability to fully or timely recover such costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, concerns over GHG emissions and their effect on the environment have led, and could lead further, to reduced demand for coal-fired power, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFurthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect our business and operations. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at our electric power generation facilities and our support facilities. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity, would also be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease our revenues. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of our fossil-fuel fired electric power generation facilities.\nIf any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. Please see \u201cItem 1. Business - Environmental Matters\u201d for additional information of environmental matters impacting us, including those relating to regulation of GHG emissions.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws, rules and regulations that require capital expenditures, increase our cost of operations, may expose us to environmental liabilities or make continued operation of certain generating units unprofitable.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, regional and local environmental protection and health and safety laws, rules and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and transportation of regulated materials, including CCR; the use and discharge of water used in generation boilers and for cooling purposes; the emission and discharge of hazardous and other materials into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. Such laws, rules and regulations can become stricter over time, and we could also become subject to additional environmental laws, rules and regulations and other requirements in the future. Environmental laws, rules and regulations also generally require us to comply with inspections and obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other governmental authorizations. These laws and regulations often require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining and renewing licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations from federal, state and local agencies. If we are not able to timely comply with inspections and obtain, maintain or comply with all environmental laws, rules and regulations, and all licenses, permits, and other government authorizations required to operate our business, then our operations could be prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. A violation of environmental laws, rules, regulations, permits or other requirements can result in substantial fines, penalties, other sanctions, permit revocation, facility shutdowns, the imposition of stricter environmental standards and controls or other injunctive measures affecting operating assets. Compliance with these laws, regulations and other requirements requires us to expend significant funds and resources and could at some point become prohibitively expensive or result in our shutting down (temporarily or permanently) or altering the operation of our facilities. Under certain environmental laws, we could also be held responsible for costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. We could also be held strictly, jointly and severally liable for human exposure to hazardous substances or for other environmental damage. From time to time we are subject to enforcement and litigation actions for claims of noncompliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations or other environmental requirements. We cannot assure that we will be successful in defending against any claim of noncompliance. Any actual or alleged violation of environmental laws, rules, regulations and other requirements also may require us to expend significant resources to defend against any such alleged violations and expose us to unexpected costs. Our costs and liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, we are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits and reputational risk associated with CCR, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash, and air pollution control wastes generated at our current and former coal-fired generation plant sites. We expect to incur substantial costs to comply with CCR rules and requirements and any changes to existing CCR rules or requirements or other new rules or requirements addressing CCR may require us to incur additional costs. Also, we may become subject to CCR-related lawsuits or involved in other CCR-related litigation that may require us to incur other costs or expose us to unexpected liabilities, which could be significant. In addition, CCR and its production at our facilities have been the subject of interest from environmental non-governmental organizations and the media. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPlease see \u201cItem 1. Business - Environmental Matters\u201d for additional information of environmental matters impacting us.\nIf we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.\nAs an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, IPL is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and is guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures. Although we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the IURC will approve full recovery in a timely manner. If we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and local, state and federal regulation, as well as litigation and other proceedings that could affect our operations and costs.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation at the federal, state and local levels. For example, at the federal level, IPL, as an electric utility, is regulated by the FERC and the NERC and, at the state level, we are regulated by the IURC. The regulatory power of the IURC over IPL is both comprehensive and typical of the traditional form of regulation generally imposed by state public utility commissions. We face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action. Regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in Indiana. IPL is subject to regulation by the IURC as to our services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of securities and long-term debt, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters.\nIPL\u2019s tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and charges which are set and approved by the IURC after public hearings. In addition, IPL\u2019s rates typically include various adjustment mechanisms and we must seek approval from the IURC through such public proceedings of our rate adjustment mechanism factors to reflect changes in certain costs. There can be no assurance that we will be granted approval of rate adjustment mechanism factors that we request from the IURC. The failure to obtain IURC approval of requested relief, or any other adverse rate determination by the IURC could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAs a result of the EPAct and subsequent legislation affecting the electric utility industry, we have been required to comply with rules and regulations in areas including mandatory reliability standards, cyber security, transmission expansion and energy efficiency. We are currently unable to predict the long-term impact, if any, to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as a result of these rules and regulations. Complying with the regulatory environment to which we are subject requires us to expend a significant amount of funds and resources. The failure to comply with this regulatory environment could subject us to substantial financial costs and penalties and changes, either forced or voluntary, in the way we operate our business.\nIndependent of the IURC\u2019s ability to review basic rates and charges, Indiana law requires electric utilities under the jurisdiction of the IURC to meet operating expense and income test requirements as a condition for approval of requested changes in the FAC. Additionally, the fuel charge applied for can be reduced if a utility\u2019s rolling twelve-month operating income, determined at quarterly measurement dates, exceeds a utility\u2019s authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income and there are not sufficient applicable cumulative net operating income deficiencies against which the excess rolling twelve-month jurisdictional net operating income can be offset.\nFuture events, including the advent of retail competition within IPL\u2019s service territory, could result in the deregulation of part of IPL\u2019s existing regulated business. In addition to effects on our business that could result from any deregulation, such as a loss of customers and increased costs to retain or attract customers upon deregulation, adjustments to IPL\u2019s accounting records may be required to eliminate the historical impact of regulatory accounting. Such adjustments, as required by FASB ASC 980 \u201cRegulated Operations,\u201d could eliminate the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities. Required adjustments could include the expensing of any unamortized net regulatory assets, the elimination of certain tax liabilities, and a write down of any impaired utility plant balances. We expect IPL to meet the criteria for the application of ASC 980 for the foreseeable future.\nWe are subject to litigation, regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, audits, settlements, investigations and claims from time to time that require us to expend significant funds to address. There can be no assurance that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Asbestos and other regulated substances are, and may continue to be, present at our facilities, and we have been named as a defendant in asbestos litigation. The continued presence of asbestos and other regulated substances at these facilities could result in additional litigation being brought against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Please see Note 2, \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d and Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to the Financial Statements for a summary of significant regulatory matters and legal proceedings involving us.\nTax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these legislative measures.\nFor example, the U.S. federal government enacted tax reform in 2017 that, among other things, reduces U.S. federal corporate income tax rates, imposes limits on tax deductions for interest expense and changes the rules related to capital expenditure cost recovery. There are a number of uncertainties and ambiguities as to the interpretation and application of many of the provisions of the tax reform measure. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it remains difficult to assess the overall effect such tax changes will have on our earnings and cash flow, and the extent to which such changes could adversely impact our results of operations. As the impacts of the law are determined, and as yet-to-be released regulations and other guidance interpreting the new law are issued and finalized, our financial results could be materially impacted.\nIn addition, U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities and if not sustained, there could be a material impact on our results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nWe rely on access to the financial markets. General economic conditions and disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all, and cause increases in our interest expense.\nFrom time to time we rely on access to the capital and credit markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. These capital and credit markets experience volatility and disruption from time to time and the ability of corporations to raise capital can be negatively impacted. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets make it harder and more expensive to raise capital. Our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all can be adversely affected by unfavorable market conditions or declines in our creditworthiness, and we may be unable to access adequate funding to refinance our debt as it becomes due or finance capital expenditures. The extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, financial condition and prospects, the overall supply and demand in the credit markets, our credit ratings, credit capacity, the cost of financing, the financial condition, performance and prospects of other companies in our industry or with similar financial circumstances and other general economic and business conditions. It may also depend on the performance of credit counterparties and financial institutions with which we do business. Access to funds under our existing financing arrangements is also dependent on the ability of our counterparties to meet their financing commitments and our satisfying conditions to borrowing. Our inability to obtain financing on reasonable terms, or at all, with creditworthy counterparties could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, both of which would adversely impact our profitability.\nSee Note 7, \u201cDebt\u201d to the Financial Statements for information regarding indebtedness. See also \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for information related to market risks.\nThe level of our indebtedness, and the security provided for this indebtedness, could adversely affect our financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had on a consolidated basis $2,726.2 million of indebtedness and total common shareholders\u2019 equity of $521.0 million. IPL had $1,803.8 million of first mortgage bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2020, which are secured by the pledge of substantially all of the assets of IPL under the terms of IPL\u2019s mortgage and deed of trust. This level of indebtedness and related security could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund other corporate purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds, as needed.\nWe expect to incur additional debt in the future, subject to the terms of our debt agreements and regulatory approvals for any IPL debt. To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Accordingly, our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. For a further discussion of outstanding debt, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and Note 7, \u201cDebt\u201d to the Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nWe have variable rate debt that bears interest based on a prevailing rate that is reset based on a market index that can be affected by market demand, supply, market interest rates and other market conditions. We also maintain both cash on deposit and investments in cash equivalents from time to time that could be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. As such, any event which impacts market interest rates could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, ratings agencies issue credit ratings on us and our debt that affect our borrowing costs under our financial arrangements and affect our potential pool of investors and funding sources. Our credit ratings also govern the collateral provisions of certain of our contracts. If the rating agencies were to downgrade our credit ratings, our borrowing costs would likely further increase, our potential pool of investors and funding resources could be reduced, and we could be required to post additional cash collateral under selected contracts. These events would likely reduce our liquidity and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIPALCO is a holding company and parent of IPL and other subsidiaries. IPALCO\u2019s cash flow is dependent on operating cash flows of IPL and its ability to pay cash to IPALCO.\nIPALCO is a holding company with no material assets other than the common stock of its subsidiaries, and accordingly all cash is generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries, principally IPL. As such, IPALCO\u2019s cash flow is largely dependent on the operating cash flows of IPL and its ability to pay cash to IPALCO. IPL\u2019s mortgage and deed of trust, its amended articles of incorporation and its Credit Agreement contain restrictions on IPL\u2019s ability to issue certain securities or pay cash dividends to IPALCO. For example, there are restrictions that require maintenance of a leverage ratio which could limit the ability of IPL to pay dividends. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity\u201d for a discussion of these restrictions. See Note 7, \u201cDebt\u201d to the Financial Statements for information regarding indebtedness. In addition, IPL is regulated by the IURC, which possesses broad oversight powers to ensure that the needs of utility customers are being met. The IURC could impose additional restrictions on the ability of IPL to distribute, loan or advance cash to IPALCO pursuant to these broad powers. While we do not expect any of the foregoing restrictions to significantly affect IPL\u2019s ability to pay funds to IPALCO in the future, a significant limitation on IPL\u2019s ability to pay dividends or loan or advance funds to IPALCO would have a material adverse effect on IPALCO\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur ownership by AES subjects us to potential risks that are beyond our control.\nAll of IPL\u2019s common stock is owned by IPALCO, all of whose common stock is owned by AES U.S. Investments (82.35%) and CDPQ (17.65%). Due to our relationship with AES, any adverse developments and announcements concerning AES may impair our ability to access the capital markets and to otherwise conduct business. In particular, downgrades in AES\u2019s credit ratings could result in IPL\u2019s or IPALCO\u2019s credit ratings being downgraded.", "PERMNO": 21370, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "AES4"}
