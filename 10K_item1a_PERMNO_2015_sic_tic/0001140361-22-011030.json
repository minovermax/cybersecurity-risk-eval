{"cik": "1368514", "company": "ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\n\u2022\nWe have a history of losses and we may, in the future, need to raise additional capital to operate our business, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\n\u2022\nWe are currently not profitable and may never become profitable.\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread has significantly affected worldwide economic conditions, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, as well as a change to the overall market size and potential for our products.\n\u2022\nWe contract with third parties for the filling, packaging, testing and labeling of the drug substance we manufacture. This reliance on third parties carries the risk that the services upon which we rely may not be performed in a timely manner or according to our specifications, which could delay the availability of our finished drug product and could adversely affect our commercialization efforts and our revenues.\n\u2022\nThe estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market and revenue growth included in our filings may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\n\u2022\nBoth of our business segments and our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, which, depending on the outcome of such inspections, could result in certain FDA actions, including the issuance of observations, notices, citations or warning letters.\n\u2022\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nIf we are unsuccessful in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or if any of our product candidates do not provide positive results, we may be required to delay or abandon development of such product, which would have a material adverse impact on our business.\n\u2022\nAlthough we have received approval from the FDA to market ASCENIV as a treatment for PIDD, our ability to market or seek approval for ASCENIV for alternative indications could be limited and FDA could require clinical trials beyond what we may deem to be reasonable. Unless additional clinical trials are successfully conducted and the FDA approves a BLA or other required submission for review, we may not be authorized to market ASCENIV for any other indication.\n\u2022\nWith the approval to market ASCENIV, BIVIGAM and Nabi-HB, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in further developing and expanding commercial operations or balancing our research and development activities with our commercialization activities.\n\u2022\nWe depend on third-party researchers, developers and vendors to develop, manufacture, supply materials for or test our products and product candidates, and such parties are outside of our control.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our manufacturing processes to fulfill demand for our products or increase our production capabilities through the addition of new equipment, including if we do not obtain requisite approval from the FDA.\n\u2022\nOur products, and any additional products for which we may obtain marketing approval in the future, could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we could be subject to substantial penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products following approval.\n\u2022\nHistorically, a few customers have accounted for a significant amount of our total revenue and accounts receivable and the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nIssues with product quality and compliance could have a material adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.\n\u2022\nIf physicians, payers and patients do not accept and use our current products or our future product candidates, our ability to generate revenue from these products will be materially impaired.\n\u2022\nOur long-term success may depend on our ability to supplement our existing product portfolio through new product development or the in-license or acquisition of other new products, product candidates and label expansion of existing products, and if our business development efforts are not successful, our ability to achieve profitability may be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nOur ADMA BioCenters operations collect information from donors in the U.S. that subjects us to consumer and health privacy laws, which could create enforcement and litigation exposure if we fail to meet their requirements.\n\u2022\nOur senior credit facility with Hayfin Services LLP (\u201cHayfin\u201d) is subject to acceleration in specified circumstances, which may result in Hayfin taking possession and disposing of any collateral.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to protect our patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights, if our patents are challenged or if our provisional patent applications do not get approved, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.\n\u2022\nCyberattacks and other security breaches could compromise our proprietary and confidential information, which could harm our business and reputation.\n\u2022\nOur ability to continue to produce safe and effective products depends on the safety of our plasma supply, testing by third parties and the timing of receiving the testing results, and manufacturing processes against transmittable diseases.\n\u2022\nWe could become supply-constrained and our financial performance would suffer if we cannot obtain adequate quantities of FDA-approved source plasma with proper specifications or other necessary raw materials.\n\u2022\nWe require additional funding and may be unable to raise capital in the future, which would force us to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs or potentially modify our ongoing operations, commercialization efforts and expansion plans, as well as impact the overall business plan for the organization.\n\u2022\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\nRisk Factors\nDescribed below are various risks and uncertainties that may affect our business. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. You should recognize that other significant risks and uncertainties may arise in the future, which we cannot foresee at this time. Also, the risks that we now foresee might affect us to a greater or different degree than expected. Certain risks and uncertainties, including ones that we currently deem immaterial or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also affect our business. If any of the risks described below actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and the section entitled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d before you decide to invest in our securities.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nTo date, we have a history of losses and have historically needed to raise, and in the future may be required to raise, additional capital to operate our business.\nOur long-term liquidity depends upon our ability to grow our commercial programs, expand our commercial operations at the Boca Facility, improve our supply-chain capabilities, improve production yields, provide more control and visibility for timing of commercial product releases, continue to build out our commercial infrastructure and meet our ongoing obligations. In addition, our end-to-end production cycle from procurement of raw materials to commercial release of finished product can take between seven and 12 months or potentially longer, requiring substantial investments in raw material plasma and other manufacturing materials.\nWe currently anticipate, based upon our projected revenue and expenditures, that our current cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable, including the proceeds received and expected to be received from the refinancing of our senior credit facility and the amount of remaining funds available under the distribution agreement for the sale of our common stock (see \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), will be sufficient to fund our operations, as currently conducted, into the first quarter of 2024, at which time we believe we will begin to generate positive cash flow from operations. This time frame may change based upon how quickly we are able to execute on our commercialization efforts and operational initiatives and whether or not the assumptions underlying our projected revenues and expenses are correct. We are also continuing to evaluate a variety of strategic and financing alternatives through our ongoing engagement with Morgan Stanley as a financial advisor. We anticipate that we will not be able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to achieve profitability until the beginning of 2024. If we are unable to raise additional capital if needed, we may have to delay, curtail or eliminate our commercialization efforts as well as product development activities. Even if we are able to raise additional capital, such equity or debt financings may only be available on unattractive terms, resulting in significant dilution of stockholders\u2019 interests and, in such event, the value and potential future market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, if we raise additional funds through license arrangements or through the disposition of any of our assets, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or assets or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nHistorically, the major source of our cash has been from proceeds from various public and private offerings of our common stock. The actual amount of cash that we will need is subject to many factors. There can be no assurances that additional financing will be available if needed or that management will be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or that we will become profitable and generate positive operating cash flow.\nWe are currently not profitable and may never become profitable.\nWe have a history of losses and expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flows into fiscal 2023, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred net losses of $71.6 million and $75.7 million, respectively. From our inception in 2004 through December 31, 2021, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $412.1 million. We expect that we will not be able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to achieve profitability until the beginning of 2024 and, as a result, we may need to continue to finance our operations through additional equity or debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing agreements. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we:\n\u2022\nexpand commercialization and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nimplement additional internal systems, controls and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nhire additional personnel;\n\u2022\nexpand and build out our plasma center network; and\n\u2022\nexpand production capacity at the Boca Facility.\nAs a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread has significantly affected worldwide economic conditions, caused supply chain disruptions and could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including the Delta and Omicron variants and other resistant strains of the coronavirus, has the potential to adversely impact several aspects of each of our business segments, our commercial manufacturing operations and plasma collection facilities, including but not limited to potential disruptions to our supply-chain operations, including procurement of raw materials and packaging materials, a portion of which are sourced internationally, and the testing of finished drug product that is required prior to its availability for commercial sale. Such testing has historically been performed by contract laboratories outside the United States. While we do not believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected operations and immunoglobulin production at our Boca Facility or our ADMA BioCenters plasma collection operations at this time, we may experience adverse effects in the future. For example, our employees becoming ill, the imposition of additional mandatory remote working environments and federal, state and local responses to the pandemic could materially affect the efficiency and pace of our operations and manufacturing at our Boca Facility. Employee or donor illness, if not properly managed, could also impact the quality of our products and product candidates. Further, in certain instances and geographic regions, we may experience decreased customer engagement (for example, as a result of a temporary shutdown of a customer\u2019s facilities resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or the continuation of no in-person meetings) could impact our results of operations. In addition, travel and other restrictions that have been implemented in the United States could impact our commercial efforts with respect to any of our products, including BIVIGAM and ASCENIV, as trade shows, industry and medical conferences and other events we had been planning to utilize and exhibit and attend with our staff to increase awareness of our products by physicians and payers are subject to limitations, rescheduling or outright cancellation in response to the pandemic. Also, due to a combination of previous state and local \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, as well as government stimulus packages, amongst other initiatives, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, lower than expected donor collections at our FDA-licensed plasma collection centers. We were also subject to delays in shipments of source plasma from our contracted third-party suppliers, as well as delays in deliveries for personal protective equipment, reagents and other non-plasma raw materials and supplies used in the manufacture, testing and distribution of our products. We have also experienced supply chain delays as a result of significant resources being diverted towards the rapid development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, which could result in our need to carry more inventory than we have in the past, which would put an additional strain on our cash resources.\nIn the future we may continue to experience pandemic-related challenges with respect to obtaining and manufacturing a sufficient amount of supplies, raw materials, and finished product to meet our need for commercial and clinical product supply. If we or any of our suppliers or manufacturers are adversely impacted by the pandemic or the restrictions resulting from the outbreak, if they or we cannot obtain the necessary supplies, or if third parties need to prioritize other products or customers over us, including under the Defense Production Act, we may experience future delays or disruptions in our supply chain, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business. Moreover, we, our suppliers, and any third-party manufacturers may also need to implement measures and changes, or deviate from typical requirements, because of the pandemic that may otherwise adversely impact our supply chains or the quality of the resulting products or supplies. Depending on the change, we may need to obtain FDA pre-approval or otherwise provide the FDA with a notification of the change.\nTo the extent that we or our partners are conducting clinical trials, the pandemic could cause delays or disruptions in these or future development programs. By example, the pandemic may result in slower enrollment, the need to suspend enrollment into studies, patient withdrawals, postponement of planned clinical or preclinical studies, redirection of site resources from studies, study modification, suspension, or termination, the introduction of remote study procedures and modified informed consent procedures, study site changes, direct delivery of investigational products to patient homes requiring state licensing, study deviations or noncompliance, and changes or delays in site monitoring. The foregoing may require that we consult with relevant review and ethics committees, IRBs, and the FDA. The foregoing may also impact the integrity of our study data. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also increase the need for clinical trial patient monitoring and regulatory reporting of adverse effects. The pandemic could further impact our ability to interact with the FDA or other regulatory authorities and may result in delays in the conduct of inspections or review of pending applications or submissions. No assurances can be provided as to the timing for completion of any regulatory submissions or applications that may be impacted by restrictions related to COVID-19 or other circumstances unknown to us presently or that are out of our direct control. Due to the potential impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on clinical trials, drug development, and manufacturing, the FDA issued a number of guidances specifically concerning COVID-19, including guidances with respect to blood and blood components. The FDA\u2019s guidance is continually evolving.\nSubsequent to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been a noticeable decline in certain medical prescriptions attributed to lower incident rates for illnesses, hospital admissions and delays in diagnosis of certain health conditions and a reduction in doctor visits. In addition, physical and social distancing guidelines issued by public health authorities and the resulting global changes in human behavior resulted in an observed reduction in infection transmission rates and spread of bacterial and viral infections, resulting in lower rates of infection across all patient populations, which, if continued, could potentially negatively impact the use of our IVIG products by patients. While COVID-19-related requirements vary across the United States, there are recent reports of increasing rates of other viral infections in certain locations and geographic regions of the country and as such may impact the usage and/or demand for our IVIG products. Additionally, the previous guidelines that were issued by public health authorities or any new or changing recommendations or guidelines may still impact the demand for or usage as well as the prescriptions of our IVIG products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also result in changes in laws and regulations. By example, in March 2020, the U.S. Congress passed the CARES Act, which includes various provisions regarding FDA drug shortage reporting requirements, as well as provisions regarding supply chain security, such as risk management plan requirements, and the promotion of supply chain redundancy and domestic manufacturing. The CARES Act further included reporting requirements related to the volume of products produced over the course of the year. FDA recently issued guidance regarding this requirement. This and any future changes in law may require that we change our internal processes and procedures to ensure continued compliance.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, operations, or financial condition, or on healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has not adversely affected our capital and financial resources to date, the pandemic\u2019s effects could have a material impact on our ability to access the capital markets as needed and on our operations and business, including those of the third parties on which we rely. Because we are unable to determine the ultimate severity or duration of the pandemic or its effects on, among other things, the global, national or local economies, the capital and credit markets, our workforce, our customers or our suppliers, at this time we are unable to predict whether COVID-19 will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe contract with third parties for a portion of the filling, packaging, testing and labeling of the drug substance we manufacture. This reliance on third parties carries the risk that the services upon which we rely may not be performed in a timely manner or according to our specifications, which could delay the availability of our finished drug product and could adversely affect our commercialization efforts and our revenues.\nThird-party fill/finish providers may not perform as agreed or in accordance with FDA requirements. Any significant problem that our fill/finish providers experience could delay or interrupt our supply of finished drug product until the service provider cures the problem or until we locate, negotiate for, validate and receive FDA approval for an alternative provider (when necessary), if one is available. Failure to obtain the needed fill/finish services could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations.\nAlthough we have received FDA approval for the fill/finish suite we built at the Boca Facility, we also intend to continue to utilize third parties to supplement our fill/finish process for final drug substance. Our anticipated reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify contract fill/finishers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential service providers is limited and the FDA must inspect and qualify any contract manufacturers for current cGMP compliance as part of our marketing application;\n\u2022\na new fill/finisher would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, the production of our products and product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our contracted fill/finishers\u2019 operations, supply chain or workforce;\n\u2022\nour contracted fill/finishers\u2019 resources and level of expertise with plasma-derived biologics may be limited, and therefore they may require a significant amount of support from us in order to implement and maintain the infrastructure and processes required to deliver our finished drug product;\n\u2022\nour third-party fill/finishers might be unable to timely provide finished drug product in sufficient quantity to meet our commercial needs;\n\u2022\ncontract manufacturers may not be able to execute our inspection procedures and required tests appropriately;\n\u2022\ncontract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other government regulations, and we do not have control over third-party providers\u2019 compliance with these regulations;\n\u2022\ncontract manufacturers may fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, placing them and us at risk of regulatory enforcement actions, recalls and other adverse consequences, which may negatively impact our business and their ability to supply products to meet our development, clinical and commercial needs;\n\u2022\nour third-party fill/finishers could breach or terminate their agreements with us; and\n\u2022\nour contract fill/finishers may have unacceptable or inconsistent drug product quality success rates and yields, and we have no direct control over our contract fill/finishers\u2019 ability to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel.\nEach of these risks could delay or prevent the completion of our finished drug product and the release of finished drug product by us or the FDA, which could result in higher costs or adversely impact the commercialization of our products. These risks could also result in the delay in obtaining clinical supplies, which would delay our development programs. In addition, our contract fill/finishers and our other third-party vendors may source their materials and supplies globally and are therefore subject to supply disruptions in the event of fire, weather related events such as hurricanes, wind and rain, international conflicts, trade and sanction requirements and limits, other acts of God or force majeure events or global health occurrences and emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market and revenue growth included in our filings may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate, including as a result of changing circumstances during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the size and growth of the overall U.S. IVIG and source plasma markets are subject to significant variables that can be difficult to measure, estimate or quantify. Our business depends on, among other things, successful commercialization of our existing products, market acceptance of such products and ensuring that our products are safe and effective. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate the revenue that we believe our products and plasma facilities are capable of generating. As a result, we may not be able to accurately forecast or predict revenue. For these reasons, the estimates and forecasts in our filings relating to revenue generation and growth may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nBoth of our business segments and our facilities, as well as our suppliers and contractors, are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, which, depending on the outcome of such inspections, could result in certain FDA actions, including the issuance of observations, notices, citations or warning letters.\nWe and our suppliers and contractors may be unable to comply with our specifications, cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state, and foreign regulatory requirements for commercial and clinical supply. The FDA is authorized to perform inspections of our and our suppliers\u2019 facilities, including the Boca Facility. The FDA also may inspect and approve our and our third-parties\u2019 facilities before they may be used for commercial production. At the end of such an inspection, the FDA could issue a Form 483 Notice of Inspectional Observations, which could cause FDA to not approve the use of the facility and cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue an untitled letter as an initial correspondence that cites violations that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance of a warning letter. FDA guidelines also provide for the issuance of warning letters for violations of \u201cregulatory significance\u201d for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. FDA also may issue warning letters and untitled letters in connection with events or circumstances unrelated to an FDA inspection. Depending on the seriousness of any findings, we or our suppliers may be subject to additional significant enforcement actions which could have a material impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to timely resolve concerns raised by the FDA as a result of an inspection or without expending significant resources. We are unable to control the timing of FDA inspections, communications and actions, and will be required to respond to the FDA and make certain submissions within certain timeframes. We also do not know whether or not the FDA will change its requirements, guidance or expectations. If the FDA determines that we have not remediated the issues identified in a warning letter or any other inspection issues and deficiencies, any failure of ours to address or provide requested documentation of corrections for these issues could disrupt our business operations and the timing of our commercialization efforts and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our commercial manufacturing and any research and development activities involve the use of biological and hazardous materials and produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized internally and by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our commercial manufacturing, research and development, or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties, or other sanctions.\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations, including our headquarters located in Ramsey, NJ, the Boca Facility and our plasma collection facilities, are vulnerable to interruption by fire, weather related events such as hurricanes, wind and rain, other acts of God or force majeure events, electric power loss, telecommunications failure, equipment failure, cyberattacks on our operations and information technology systems and breakdown, human error, employee issues, global health occurrences such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and emergencies, product liability claims and events beyond our control. While we maintain several insurance policies with reputable carriers that provide partial coverage for a variety of these risks, including replacing or rebuilding a part of our facilities, these policies are subject to the insurance carriers\u2019 final determination of compensation to us and we may not have adequate coverage if we need to rebuild or replace our inventory, infrastructure, business income or our entire facility. In addition, our disaster recovery plans for our facilities may not be adequate and we do not have an alternative manufacturing facility or contractual arrangements with other manufacturers in the event of a casualty to or destruction of any of our facilities. If we are required to rebuild or relocate any of our facilities, a substantial investment in improvements and equipment would be necessary. We carry only a limited amount of business interruption insurance, which may not sufficiently compensate us for losses that may occur. As a result, any significant business interruption could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unsuccessful in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or if any of our product candidates do not provide positive results, we may be required to delay or abandon development of such product, which would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nProduct candidates require extensive clinical data analysis and regulatory review and may require additional testing. Clinical trials and data analysis can be very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement. The conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials is subject to numerous risks and results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain. Human clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming. Furthermore, delays or setbacks can occur at any stage of the process, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon our product development programs and related INDs or BLAs, or to repeat clinical trials. The evolving COVID-19 pandemic may directly or indirectly affect the pace of enrollment in clinical trials as patients may be restricted in traveling to and accessing healthcare facilities and physicians\u2019 offices. Additionally, such healthcare facilities and offices have their limited resources directed towards treating patients with COVID-19 symptoms. The commencement and completion of clinical trials for any current or future development product candidate may be delayed by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\ndetermination of dosing issues;\n\u2022\nlack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u2022\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u2022\ntemporary suspension resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe cannot be certain as to what type and how many clinical trials the FDA, or equivalent foreign regulatory agencies, will require us to conduct before we may successfully gain approval to market any of our product candidates that still require FDA approval. Prior to approving a new drug or biologic, the FDA generally requires that the effectiveness of the product candidate (which is not typically fully investigated until Phase 3) be demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. However, if the FDA or an equivalent foreign regulatory authority determines that our Phase 3 clinical trial results do not demonstrate a statistically significant, clinically meaningful benefit with an acceptable safety profile, or if a relevant regulator requires us to conduct additional Phase 3 clinical trials in order to gain approval, we will incur significant additional development costs and commercialization of these products would be prevented or delayed and our business could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the FDA or an IRB may not permit us to commence a clinical trial, may require amendments to our clinical trial protocols, or may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA or IRB finds deficiencies in our IND submissions or the conduct of these trials. Regulatory authorities may also not accept data from clinical trials if the trials are not conducted in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may also result in enforcement actions. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance or predict with certainty the schedule for future clinical trials. In the event we do not ultimately receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may be required to terminate development of such product candidates. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval to market and sell our product candidates, or if approval is delayed, we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will increase.\nIf the results of our clinical trials do not support our product candidate claims, completing the development of such product candidate may be significantly delayed or we may be forced to abandon development of such product candidate altogether.\nWe cannot be certain that the clinical trial results of our product candidates will support our product candidates\u2019 claims. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing.\nThe clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.\nOther issues that may impact our clinical trials and that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, include:\n\u2022\nDelays in reaching, or failure to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites and our CROs;\n\u2022\nRegulators requiring us to perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval or becoming subject to additional post-marketing testing, surveillance, or REMS requirements to maintain regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nFailure by our third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or the clinical trial protocol, or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or our being required to engage in additional clinical trial site monitoring;\n\u2022\nThe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates being greater than we anticipate or our having insufficient funds for a clinical trial or to pay the substantial user fees required by FDA upon the filing of a marketing application;\n\u2022\nInsufficient supply or inadequate quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials;\n\u2022\nInability to achieve sufficient study enrollment, subjects dropping out or withdrawing from our studies, delays in adding new investigators or clinical trial sites or a withdrawal of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nFlaws in our clinical trial design that are not discoverable until the clinical trial has progressed;\n\u2022\nDisagreement by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities with our intended indications or study design, including endpoints, or our interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials, finding that a product candidate\u2019s benefits do not outweigh its safety risks or requiring that we conduct additional development or study work;\n\u2022\nThe need to make changes to our product candidates that require additional testing or that cause our product candidates to perform differently than expected;\n\u2022\nGlobal trade policies that may impact our ability to obtain raw materials and/or finished product for commercialization;\n\u2022\nFDA or comparable regulatory authorities taking longer than we anticipate to make decisions on our products or product candidates; and\n\u2022\nPotential inability to demonstrate that a product or product candidate provides an advantage over current standards of care or current or future competitive therapies in development.\nIn addition, our clinical trials involve a relatively small patient population. Because of the small sample size, the results of these clinical trials may not be indicative of future results. In addition, certain portions of our clinical trials and product testing for our product candidates may be performed outside of the U.S., and therefore, may not be performed in accordance with standards normally required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies.\nIf we do not obtain and maintain the necessary U.S. or international regulatory approvals to commercialize a product candidate, we will not be able to sell that product candidate, which would make it difficult for us to recover the costs of researching and developing such product candidate.\nIf we are not able to generate revenue from our products and product candidates, our sources of revenue may continue to be from a product mix consisting only of plasma collection and sales revenues, revenues generated from sales of our FDA-approved commercial products, revenues generated from ongoing contract manufacturing for third parties and revenues generated from the sales of manufacturing intermediates. We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any product candidate we may acquire or develop in the future. In order to obtain FDA approval of any product candidate requiring FDA approval, our clinical development must demonstrate that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use, and we must successfully complete an FDA BLA review. Obtaining FDA approval of a product candidate generally requires significant research and testing, referred to as preclinical studies, as well as human tests, referred to as clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in products that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process and may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies or may require additional CMC or other data and information, and the development and provision of this data and information may be time-consuming and expensive. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation, diversion of resources for FDA review during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may:\n\u2022\ndelay commercialization of, and our ability to derive revenues from, our product candidates;\n\u2022\nimpose costly procedures on us; and\n\u2022\ndiminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject our product candidate\u2019s BLA. In addition, the FDA could determine that we must test additional subjects and/or require that we conduct further studies with more subjects. We may never obtain regulatory approval for any future potential product candidate or label expansion activity. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by leaving us without the ability to generate additional accretive revenues. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop or acquire other product candidates. In foreign jurisdictions, we must receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize any products or product candidates outside the U.S. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks and uncertainties associated with the FDA review, inspection and approval procedures described above. We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any product candidate for sale outside the U.S.\nAlthough we have received approval from the FDA to market ASCENIV as a treatment for PIDD, our ability to market or seek approval for ASCENIV for alternative indications could be limited, unless additional clinical trials are conducted successfully and the FDA approves a BLA or other required submission for review.\nThe FDA and other governmental authorities strictly regulate and monitor marketing, labeling and the advertising and promotion of prescription drugs. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the Internet and off-label promotion. The FDA does not allow drugs to be promoted for \u201coff-label\u201d uses\u2009-\u2009that is, uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those that were approved by the FDA. The FDA limits approved uses to those studied by a company in its clinical trials. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. Although we have received approval from the FDA to market ASCENIV as a treatment for PIDD, we cannot be sure whether we will be able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for ASCENIV.\nWhile physicians in the U.S. may choose, and are generally permitted, to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling, and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote our products is narrowly limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. \u201cOff-label\u201d uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. If the FDA determines that our promotional activities fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines related to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, bring an enforcement action against us, suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require a recall, require payment of civil fines or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, among other consequences, any of which could harm our reputation and our business.\nWith the approval of ASCENIV, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in further developing and expanding commercial operations or balancing our research and development activities with our commercialization activities.\nSince receiving FDA approval for ASCENIV, we have been commercializing this product while also continuing our research and development activities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the balance of our research and development operations with our commercialization activities. Potential investors and stockholders should be aware of the problems, delays, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies balancing development of product candidates, which can include problems such as unanticipated issues relating to clinical trials and receipt of approvals from the FDA and foreign regulatory bodies, with commercialization efforts, which can include problems related to managing manufacturing and supply, including supply chain constraints directly or indirectly caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and government responses thereto, reimbursement, marketing challenges, development of a comprehensive compliance program, and other related and additional costs. For example, the raw material plasma we collect and procure to manufacture ASCENIV using our patented proprietary microneutralization assay is comprised of plasma collected from donors which contains high titer antibodies to RSV. This high titer plasma which meets our internal specifications for the manufacture of ASCENIV that we are able to identify with our patented testing assay amounts\nto less than 10% of the total donor collection samples we test. As a result, we may experience an insufficient supply of this plasma.\nOur product candidates will require significant additional research and clinical trials, and we will need to overcome significant regulatory burdens prior to commercialization in the U.S. and other countries. In addition, we may be required to spend significant funds on building out our commercial operations. There can be no assurance that after the expenditure of substantial funds and efforts, we will successfully develop and commercialize any of our product candidates, generate any significant revenues or ever achieve and maintain a substantial level of sales of our products.\nWe depend on third-party researchers, developers and vendors to develop, manufacture or test products and product candidates, as well as for other pre-and-post approval services, and such parties are, to some extent, outside of our control.\nWe depend on independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions, contract laboratories, CROs, contract manufacturers, contract fill/finishers and consultants to conduct our preclinical activities, clinical trials, CMC testing and other activities under agreements with us. These collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs or the impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will have on such third parties. These investigators may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our product-development programs, or if their performance is substandard, our trials may be repeated, extended, delayed, or terminated, the approval of our FDA application(s), if any, and our introduction of new products, if any, will be delayed. We or they may also be subject to regulatory enforcement actions and we may not be able to meet commercial demand. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may compete with us. If our collaborators assist our competitors at our expense, our competitive position would be harmed. Additionally, any change in the regulatory compliance status of any of our vendors may impede our ability to receive approval for our product candidates.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand our manufacturing processes to fulfill demand for our products or increase our production capabilities through the addition of new equipment, including if we do not obtain requisite approval from the FDA.\nWe currently anticipate expanding the manufacturing capacity of our Boca Facility by approximately 50% or more. We also anticipate expanding our production capabilities through the addition of our fill-finish machine at our Boca Facility. Following the expansion of any of our manufacturing processes or the addition of new equipment, such as our fill-finish machine, we will need to validate the expanded facility and equipment and have it inspected by the FDA. Given the significant delays that may result during the validation process, including due to any diverted FDA attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience a significant supply shortage of our products or our production capabilities may be limited until completion of and validation of our facility expansion and new manufacturing equipment.\nOur products, and any additional products for which we may obtain marketing approval in the future, could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we could be subject to substantial penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products following approval.\nOur products, and any additional products for which we may obtain marketing approval in the future, could be subject to post-marketing restrictions, new FDA guidance, or other regulatory actions, such as withdrawal from the market. Such products, as well as the manufacturing processes, post-marketing studies and measures, labeling and advertising and promotional activities for such products, among other things, are subject to ongoing regulatory compliance requirements, and oversight, review, and inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, adherence with labeling and promotional requirements and restrictions, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding safeguarding the drug supply chain as well as the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. For example, the FDA\u2019s approval of our PAS to allow for the commercial relaunch of BIVIGAM requires us to conduct specified post-marketing studies related to our manufacturing controls and processes, and submit specified post-marketing reports to the FDA. If, during the post-marketing period (after marketing approval) previously unknown adverse events, discovery that the product is less effective than previously thought, or other potential concerns regarding our products or their manufacturing processes emerge, or we are observed in any way to fail to comply with the numerous regulatory requirements to which we are subject, those circumstances may yield various results, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022\nclinical holds or termination of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct further post-marketing studies or clinical trials, implement risk mitigation strategies, or to issue corrective information;\n\u2022\nwarning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nrecall of products;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on coverage by third-party payers;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of products;\n\u2022\nFDA debarment, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from healthcare programs, consent decrees, or corporate integrity agreements;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nHistorically, a few customers have accounted for a significant amount of our total revenue and accounts receivable and the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, four customers, BioCare, Reliance, Curascript and AmerisourceBergen, represented an aggregate of 81% of our consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, three customers, BioCare, Reliance and Biolife Plasma Services, L.P., represented an aggregate of 82% of our consolidated revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2021, three customers, Curascript, BioCare and Reliance, represented a total of 94% of our consolidated accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2020, three customers, BioCare, Reliance and Curascript, represented a total of 92% of our consolidated accounts receivable.\nThe loss of any key customers or a material change in the revenue generated by any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, we anticipate deriving increased revenue from some of these customers over the next few years. Factors that could influence our relationships with our customers include, among other things:\n\u2022\nour ability to sell our products at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain features and quality standards for our products sufficient to meet the expectations of our customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to produce and deliver a sufficient quantity of our products in a timely manner to meet our customers\u2019 requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and government responses thereto on our customers and their businesses, operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, an adverse change in the financial condition of any of our key customers could negatively affect revenue derived from such customer, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIssues with product quality and compliance could have a material adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.\nOur success depends upon the quality of our products. Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. A quality or safety issue may result in failure to obtain product approval, adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue by us or by a third-party vendor in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity or a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully commercializing our current products and launching new products.\nIn addition, as a manufacturer of biological products, we are subject to the risks inherent in biological production, which could include normal course losses and failures inherent in the manufacturing process. As our biologics production levels increase, there may be normal course inventory losses or write-downs as we ensure product quality and compliance with cGMP, FDA, state and local regulations, or due to testing results not meeting specifications. As a result, our operating results are subject to potentially significant variability from one reporting period to the next should such normal course losses occur in any given period. However, because our products and product candidates are plasma-based products, not only are we subject to FDA\u2019s drug and biologic cGMP requirements, but we are also subject to special requirements for the collection, testing, handling, storage, and use of blood products. This adds an extra level of compliance and complexity to our operations, which we may not be able to successfully meet. Failure to meet any regulatory quality standards could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf physicians, payers and patients do not accept and use our current products or our future product candidates, our ability to generate revenue from these products will be materially impaired.\nEven if the FDA approves a product made by us, physicians, payers and patients may not accept and use it. Acceptance and use of our products depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nperceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022\ncost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products;\n\u2022\navailability of reimbursement for our products from government or other healthcare payers; and\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nThe failure of our current or future products to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing or make such financing difficult to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur long-term success may depend on our ability to supplement our existing product portfolio through new product development or the in-license or acquisition of other new products, product candidates and label expansion of existing products, and if our business development efforts are not successful, our ability to achieve profitability may be adversely impacted.\nOur current product development portfolio consists primarily of label expansion activities for Nabi-HB, BIVIGAM and ASCENIV, as well as expanding our IP estate with patents issued for S. Pneumoniae hyperimmune IG. We have initiated small scale preclinical activities to potentially expand our current portfolio through new product development efforts or to in-license or acquire additional products and product candidates. If we are not successful in developing or acquiring additional products and product candidates, we will have to depend on our ability to successfully commercialize ASCENIV, as well as our ability to generate revenue from Nabi-HB, BIVIGAM, contract manufacturing, intermediate fractions and plasma attributable to the operations of ADMA BioCenters, to support our operations.\nOur ADMA BioCenters operations collect information from donors in the U.S. that subjects us to consumer and health privacy laws, which could create enforcement and litigation exposure if we fail to meet their requirements.\nConsumer privacy is highly protected by federal and state law. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (\u201cHITECH\u201d), and their respective implementing regulations, impose, among other things, obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and business associates. A \u201ccovered entity\u201d is the primary type of HIPAA-regulated entity. Health plans/insurers, healthcare providers engaging in standard transactions (insurance/health plan claims and encounters, payment and remittance advice, claims status, eligibility, enrollment/disenrollment, referrals and authorizations, coordination of benefits and premium payments), and healthcare clearinghouses (switches that convert data between standard and non-standard data sets) are covered entities. A \u201cbusiness associate\u201d provides services to covered entities (directly or as subcontractors to other business associates) involving arranging, creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting protected health information (\u201cPHI\u201d) on a covered entity\u2019s behalf. In order to legally provide access to PHI to service providers, covered entities and business associates must enter into a \u201cbusiness associate agreement\u201d (\u201cBAA\u201d) with the service provider PHI recipient. Among other things, HITECH made certain aspects of the HIPAA\u2019s rules (notably the Security Rule) directly applicable to business associates - independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal court to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The HHS Office of Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d) has increased its focus on compliance and continues to train state attorneys general for enforcement purposes. OCR has recently increased both its efforts to audit HIPAA compliance and its level of enforcement, with one recent penalty exceeding $5.0 million.\nWhile we are not a covered entity or business associate subject to HIPAA, even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C \u00a7 45(a). The FTC expects a company\u2019s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC\u2019s guidance for appropriately securing consumers\u2019 personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule. In addition, states impose a variety of laws protecting consumer information, with certain sensitive information such as HIV/Sexually Transmitted Disease status subject to heightened standards. In addition, federal and state privacy, data security, and breach notification laws, rules and regulations, and other laws apply to the collection, use and security of personal information, including social security number, driver\u2019s license numbers, government identifiers, credit card and financial account numbers. Some state privacy and security laws apply more broadly than HIPAA and associated regulations. For example, California recently enacted legislation - the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA - which went into effect January 1, 2020, and will be amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, effective January 1, 2023. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. It remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. We could be subject to enforcement action and litigation exposure if we fail to adhere to these data privacy and security laws.\nThe Hayfin Credit Facility is subject to acceleration in specified circumstances, which may result in Hayfin taking possession and disposing of any collateral.\nOn March 23, 2022 (the \u201cHayfin Closing Date\u201d), we entered into the Hayfin Credit Agreement with Hayfin (see \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d). The Hayfin Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility in the principal amount of up to $175.0 million (the \u201cHayfin Credit Facility\u201d), composed of (i) a term loan made on the Hayfin Closing Date in the principal amount of $150.0 million (the \u201cHayfin Closing Date Loan\u201d), (ii) a delayed draw term loan in the principal amount of $25.0 million (the \u201cHayfin Delayed Draw Loan\u201d and, together with the Hayfin Closing Date Loan, the \u201cHayfin Loans\u201d). The obligation of the lenders to make the Hayfin Delayed Draw Loan expires on March 22, 2023 is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including but not limited to, our meeting certain 12-month\nrevenue targets as set forth in the Hayfin Credit Agreement. The Hayfin Credit Facility has a maturity date of March 23, 2027(the \u201cHayfin Maturity Date\u201d). The Hayfin Loans are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. Events of Default include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments, cross-defaults to material contracts and events constituting a change of control. In addition to an increase in the rate of interest on the Hayfin Loans of 3% per annum, the occurrence of an Event of Default could result in, among other things, the termination of commitments under the Hayfin Credit Facility, the declaration that all outstanding Loans are immediately due and payable in whole or in part, and Hayfin taking immediate possession of, and selling, any collateral securing the Hayfin Loans.\nDevelopments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our current products and any future product we may develop will have to compete with other marketed therapies. In addition, other companies may pursue the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, companies pursuing different but related fields represent substantial competition. Many of these organizations competing with us have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, longer product development history in obtaining regulatory approvals and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations.\nIf we are unable to protect our patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights, if our patents are challenged or if our provisional patent applications do not get approved, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.\nAs we move forward in clinical development we are also uncovering novel aspects of our products and are drafting patents to cover our inventions. We rely on a combination of patent rights, trade secrets and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so. There can be no assurance that our patents, trade secret policies and practices or other agreements will adequately protect our intellectual property. Our issued patents may be challenged, found to be over-broad or otherwise invalidated in subsequent proceedings before courts or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Even if enforceable, we cannot provide any assurances that they will provide significant protection from competition. The processes, systems, and/or security measures we use to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies as a result of any such breaches. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. There can be no assurance that the confidentiality, nondisclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties with access to our proprietary information to protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology, processes and other proprietary rights, or any other security measures relating to such trade secrets, proprietary technology, processes and proprietary rights, will be adequate, will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nWe could lose market exclusivity of a product earlier than expected.\nIn the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the majority of an innovative product\u2019s commercial value is realized during its market exclusivity period. In the U.S. and in some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic or biosimilar versions are approved and marketed or when biosimilars are introduced (even if only for a competing product), there are usually very substantial and rapid declines in a product\u2019s revenues.\nMarket exclusivity for our products is based upon patent rights and certain regulatory forms of exclusivity. The scope of our patent rights may vary from country to country and may also be dependent on the availability of meaningful legal remedies in a country. The failure to obtain patent and other intellectual property rights, or limitations on the use or loss of such rights, could be material to us. In some countries, basic patent protections for our products may not exist because certain countries did not historically offer the right to obtain specific types of patents and/or we (or our licensors) did not file in those markets. In addition, the patent environment can be unpredictable and the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Absent relevant patent protection for a product, once the data exclusivity period expires, generic versions can be approved and marketed.\nPatent rights covering our products may become subject to patent litigation. In some cases, manufacturers may seek regulatory approval by submitting their own clinical trial data to obtain marketing approval or choose to launch a generic product \u201cat risk\u201d before the expiration of our patent rights/or before the final resolution of related patent litigation. Enforcement of claims in patent litigation can be very costly, time-consuming and no assurance can be given that we will prevail. In addition, any such litigation may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business and reduce the resources available for our clinical development, manufacturing and marketing activities, and consequently have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects, regardless of the outcome.\nThere is no assurance that ASCENIV, or any other of our products for which we are issued a patent, will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period of the respective patent.\nThird parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and there can be no assurance that the required licenses would be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe may not be able to operate our business without infringing third-party patents. Numerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in fields that relate to the development and commercialization of IG. In addition, many companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage. It is possible that infringement claims may occur as the number of products and competitors in our market increases. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a greater risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. We cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. If our products, methods, processes and other technologies are found to infringe third-party patent rights, we could be prohibited from manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology, process or product unless we obtain a license under the applicable third-party patent and pay royalties or are able to design around such patent. We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and we may not be able to redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement. Even if we are able to redesign our products or processes to avoid an infringement claim, our efforts to design around the patent could require significant time, effort and expense and ultimately may lead to an inferior or more costly product and/or process. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business. Furthermore, if any such claim is successful, a court could order us to pay substantial damages, including compensatory damages for any infringement, plus prejudgment interest and could, in certain circumstances, treble the compensatory damages and award attorney fees. These damages could be substantial and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. A court also could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently prohibit us, our licensees, if any, or our customers from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing one or more of our products or practicing our proprietary technologies or processes, or could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage our growth, our business may be harmed.\nOur success will depend on the expansion of our commercial and manufacturing activities, supply of plasma and overall operations and the effective management of our growth, which will place a significant strain on our management and on our administrative, operational and financial resources. To manage this growth, we must expand our facilities, augment our operational, financial and management systems and hire and train additional qualified personnel. Our ability to accomplish each of these factors may be negatively impacted as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nThe loss of one or more key members of our management team could adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued service and performance of our management team, who have extensive experience and specialized expertise in our business. In particular, the loss of Adam S. Grossman, our President and Chief Executive Officer, could adversely affect our business and operating results. We do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies for any members of our management team. We have employment agreements with each of our executive officers; however, the existence of an employment agreement does not guarantee retention of members of our management team and we may not be able to retain those individuals for the duration of or beyond the end of their respective terms. The loss of services of key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could result in delays in development or approval of our product candidates and diversion of management resources.\nCyberattacks and other security breaches could compromise our proprietary and confidential information, which could harm our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we generate, collect and store proprietary information, including intellectual property and business information. The secure storage, maintenance, and transmission of and access to this information is important to our operations and reputation. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer systems and, if successful, misappropriate our proprietary and confidential information including e-mails and other electronic communications. Further, while many of our employees and certain suppliers with whom we do business operate in a remote working environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of cybersecurity attacks and data breaches, particularly through phishing attempts, may be increased as we and third parties with whom we interact leverage our IT infrastructure in unanticipated ways during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, an employee, contractor, or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. While we have certain safeguards in place to reduce the risk of and detect cyberattacks, including a Company-wide cybersecurity policy, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to unpermitted access by hackers or other breaches, or employee error or malfeasance. Any such compromise of our data security and access to, or public disclosure or loss of, confidential business or proprietary information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, provide our competitors with valuable information and subject us to additional costs, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to hire and retain a substantial number of qualified personnel, our ability to sustain and grow our business may be harmed.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees across various areas of our operations, such as research and development, manufacturing operations, and sales, who understand and appreciate our strategy and culture and are able to contribute to our mission. We will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in commercialization, sales, marketing, medical affairs, reimbursement, government regulation, formulation, quality control, manufacturing and finance and accounting. In particular, over the next 12-24 months, we expect to hire several new employees devoted to commercialization, sales, marketing, medical and scientific affairs, regulatory affairs, quality control, finance and general and operational management. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that our search for such personnel will be successful, particularly if the COVID-19 pandemic causes significant changes in the competitive market for such personnel, including but not limited to overall increases in the cost of labor or travel restrictions related to COVID-19, prevent us from being able to hire qualified personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently performing at a high level, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, any material increases in existing employee turnover rates or increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe currently collect human blood plasma at our ADMA BioCenters facilities, and if we cannot maintain FDA approval for these facilities or obtain FDA approval for additional facilities that we create or acquire rights to, we may be adversely affected and may not be able to sell or use this human blood plasma for future commercial purposes.\nWe intend to maintain FDA approval of our ADMA BioCenters collection facilities for the collection of human blood plasma and we may seek other governmental and regulatory approvals for these facilities. We also plan to grow through the building and licensing of additional ADMA BioCenters facilities in various regions of the U.S. Collection facilities are subject to FDA and potentially other governmental and regulatory inspections and extensive regulation, including compliance with current cGMP and blood standards and FDA and other governmental approvals, as applicable. Failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations or to receive applicable approvals for our current or future facilities may result in enforcement actions, such as adverse inspection reports, warning or untitled letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of regulatory authority approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses, any of which may significantly delay or suspend our operations for these locations, potentially having a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture our products or offer for sale plasma collected at the affected sites.\nWe manufacture our current marketed products, pipeline products, and products for third parties in our manufacturing and testing facilities, and if we or our vendors cannot maintain appropriate FDA status for these facilities, we may be adversely affected, and may not be able to sell, manufacture or commercialize these products.\nThere are no assurances we will be able to maintain compliance with all FDA or other regulations. Moreover, to the extent that we use third-party vendors to fulfill our regulatory or contractual requirements, these third-party vendors may perform activities for themselves or other clients and we may not be privy to all regulatory findings or issues discovered by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Such findings, which are out of our control, may adversely affect our ability to continue to work with these vendors, or our ability to release commercial drug product or perform necessary testing or other actions for us or our clients, which may be required in order to remain FDA compliant or to commercialize our products. If we are not able to maintain manufacturing compliance at our facilities or our vendors\u2019 facilities for our products and product candidates, we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our products and product candidates and we may face potential contractual or regulatory actions, which would have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits.\nThe testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Product liability claims may also result in recalls and/or regulatory enforcement actions. Even successful defense, however, could impair our results of operations. Our inability to obtain and maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, either alone or with collaborators.\nMany of our business practices are subject to scrutiny by federal and state regulatory authorities, as well as to lawsuits brought by private citizens under federal and state laws. Failure to comply with applicable law or an adverse decision in lawsuits may result in adverse consequences to us.\nThe laws governing our conduct in the U.S. are enforceable on the federal and state levels by criminal, civil and administrative penalties. Violations of laws such as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Social Security Act (including the Anti-Kickback Statute), the Public Health Service Act and the civil and criminal Federal False Claims Act, the civil monetary penalty statute, requirements regarding the reporting and repayment of overpayments, other fraud and abuse laws and any regulations promulgated under the authority of the preceding, may result in jail sentences, fines or exclusion from federal and state programs, as may be determined by Medicare, Medicaid and HHS and other regulatory authorities as well as by the courts. Similarly, the violation of applicable laws, rules and regulations of states, including the State of Florida with respect to the manufacture and marketing of our products and product candidates may result in jail sentences, fines or exclusion from applicable state programs. There can be no assurance that our activities will not come under the scrutiny of federal and/or state regulators and other government authorities or that our practices will not be found to violate applicable laws, rules and regulations or prompt lawsuits by private citizen \u201crelators\u201d under federal or state false claims laws.\nFor example, under the Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws and regulations, the offer or payment of anything of value for patient referrals, or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or ordering of any time or service reimbursable in whole or in part by a federal healthcare program is prohibited. This places constraints on the marketing and promotion of products and on common business arrangements, such as discounted terms and volume incentives for customers in a position to recommend or choose products for patients, such as physicians and hospitals, and these practices can result in substantial legal penalties, including, among others, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Arrangements with referral sources such as purchasers, group purchasing organizations, physicians and pharmacists must be structured with care to comply with applicable requirements. Legislators and regulators may seek to further restrict the scope of financial relationships that are considered appropriate. For example, HHS recently promulgated a regulation that is effective in two phases. First, the regulation excludes from the definition of \u201cremuneration\u201d limited categories of (a) PBM rebates or other reductions in price to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D or a Medicaid Managed Care Organization plan reflected in point-of sale reductions in price and (b) PBM service fees. Second, effective January 1, 2023, the regulation expressly provides that rebates to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D either directly to the plan sponsor under Medicare Part D, or indirectly through a pharmacy benefit manager will not be protected under the anti-kickback discount safe harbor.\nAlso, certain business practices, such as payments of consulting fees to healthcare providers, sponsorship of educational or research grants, charitable donations, interactions with healthcare providers that prescribe products for uses not approved by the FDA and financial support for continuing medical education programs, must be conducted within narrowly prescribed and controlled limits to avoid any possibility of wrongfully influencing healthcare providers to prescribe or purchase particular products or as a reward for past prescribing. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) and the companion Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which together are referred to as the \u201cHealthcare Reform Law,\u201d payments and transfers of value by pharmaceutical manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to or at the request of covered recipients, such as, but limited to, physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and certified registered nurse anesthetists and teaching hospitals, must be tracked and reported to CMS, and are publicly disclosed. Such \u201capplicable manufacturers\u201d are also required to report certain ownership interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. A number of states have similar laws in place. Additional and stricter prohibitions could be implemented by federal and state authorities. Where such practices have been found to be improper incentives to use such products, government investigations and assessments of penalties against manufacturers have resulted in substantial damages and fines. Many manufacturers have been required to enter into consent decrees or orders that prescribe allowable corporate conduct.\nFailure to satisfy requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act can also result in penalties, as well as requirements to enter into consent decrees or orders that prescribe allowable corporate conduct. In addition, while regulatory authorities generally do not regulate physicians\u2019 discretion in their choice of treatments for their patients, they do restrict communications by manufacturers on unapproved uses of approved products or on the potential safety and efficacy of unapproved products in development. Companies in the U.S., Canada and the European Union cannot promote approved products for other indications that are not specifically approved by the competent regulatory authorities such as the FDA in the U.S., nor can companies promote unapproved products. In limited circumstances, companies may disseminate to physicians information regarding unapproved uses of approved products or results of studies involving investigational products. If such activities fail to comply with applicable regulations and guidelines of the various regulatory authorities, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. Furthermore, if such activities are prohibited, it may harm demand for our products. Promotion of unapproved drugs or devices or unapproved indications for a drug or device is a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and subjects us to civil and criminal sanctions. Furthermore, sanctions under the Federal False Claims Act have recently been brought against companies accused of promoting off-label uses of drugs, because such promotion induces the use and subsequent claims for reimbursement under Medicare and other federal programs. Similar actions for off-label promotion have been initiated by several states for Medicaid fraud. The Healthcare Reform Law significantly strengthened provisions of the Federal False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute that applies to Medicare and Medicaid, and other healthcare fraud provisions, leading to the possibility of greatly increased qui tam suits by relators for perceived violations. Violations or allegations of violations of the foregoing restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are required to report detailed pricing information, net of included discounts, rebates and other concessions, to CMS for the purpose of calculating national reimbursement levels, certain federal prices and certain federal and state rebate obligations. Inaccurate or incomplete reporting of pricing information could result in liability under the False Claims Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and various other laws, rules and regulations.\nWe will need to establish systems for collecting and reporting this data accurately to CMS and institute a compliance program to assure that the information collected is complete in all respects. If we report pricing information that is not accurate to the federal government, we could be subject to fines and other sanctions that could adversely affect our business. If we choose to pursue clinical development and commercialization in the European Union or otherwise market and sell our products outside of the U.S., we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and comply with regulatory requirements in such jurisdictions. The approval procedures vary among countries in complexity and timing. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the U.S. on a timely basis, if at all, which would preclude us from commercializing products in those markets.\nIn addition, some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, regulate the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In these countries, pricing discussions with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. Such trials may be time-consuming and expensive and may not show an advantage in efficacy for our products. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, in either the U.S. or the European Union, we could be adversely affected.\nAlso, under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. has increasingly focused on regulating the conduct by U.S. businesses occurring outside of the U.S., generally prohibiting remuneration to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. To enhance compliance with applicable healthcare laws, and mitigate potential liability in the event of noncompliance, regulatory authorities such as the HHS Office of Inspector General (the \u201cOIG\u201d) have recommended the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive healthcare compliance program that generally contains the elements of an effective compliance and ethics program described in Section 8B2.1 of the U.S. Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual. Increasing numbers of U.S.-based pharmaceutical companies have such programs. We will need to adopt healthcare compliance and ethics programs that would incorporate the OIG\u2019s recommendations and train our employees. Such a program may be expensive and may not provide assurance that we will avoid compliance issues.\nWe are also required to comply with the applicable laws, rules, regulations and permit requirements of the various states in which our business operates, including the State of Florida where our manufacturing facility is located. These regulations and permit requirements are not always in concert with applicable federal laws, rules and regulations regulating our business. Although compliant with applicable federal requirements, we may be required to comply with additional state laws, rules, regulations and permits. Failure to appropriately comply with such state requirements could result in temporary or long-term cessation of our manufacturing operations, as well as fines and other sanctions. Any such penalties may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive and rigorous governmental regulation, including the requirement of FDA and other federal, state and local business regulatory approval\nbefore our products and product candidates may be lawfully marketed, and our ability to obtain regulatory approval of our products and product candidates from the FDA in a timely manner, access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations may be hindered by inadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other state and local government agencies.\nBoth before and after the approval of our products, our products, operations, facilities, suppliers and CROs are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. In the U.S., the FDA regulates, among other things, the pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, potency, labeling, storage, record keeping, quality systems, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of therapeutic products. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in, among other things, one or more of the following actions: notices of violation, untitled letters, warning letters, CRLs, fines and other monetary penalties, unanticipated expenditures, delays in approval or refusal to approve a product or product candidate, product recall or seizure, interruption of manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Our products and product candidates cannot be lawfully marketed in the U.S. without FDA and other federal, state and local business regulatory approvals. Any failure to receive the marketing approvals necessary to commercialize our product or product candidates could harm our business.\nAdditionally, the ability of the FDA and other federal, state and local business regulatory agencies to review and approve products and product candidates can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the FDA and other federal, state and local business regulatory agencies have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for products and product candidate submissions to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including in December 2018 and January 2019, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown reoccurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions and other reporting requirements which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nThe manufacturing processes for plasma-based biologics are complex and involve biological intermediates that are susceptible to contamination and impurities.\nPlasma is a raw material that is susceptible to damage and contamination and may contain human pathogens, any of which would render the plasma unsuitable as raw material for further manufacturing. For instance, improper storage of plasma, by us or third-party suppliers, may require us to destroy some of our raw material. If unsuitable plasma is not identified and discarded prior to the release of the plasma to the manufacturing process, it may be necessary to discard intermediate or finished product made from that plasma or to recall any finished product released to the market, resulting in a charge to cost of product revenue. The manufacture of our plasma products is an extremely complex process of fractionation, purification, testing, filling and finishing. Our products can become non-releasable or otherwise fail to meet our stringent specifications or regulatory agencies\u2019 specifications through a failure in one or more of these process steps. We may detect instances in which an unreleased product was produced without adherence to our manufacturing procedures or plasma used in our production process was not collected or stored in a compliant manner consistent with our cGMP or other regulations. Such an event of noncompliance would likely result in our determination that the implicated products should not be released or maybe replaced or withdrawn from the market and therefore should be destroyed. Once manufactured, our plasma-derived products must be handled carefully and kept at appropriate temperatures. Our failure, or the failure of third parties that supply, test, ship or distribute our products or product components to properly care for our products, may require that those products be destroyed. Even if handled properly, biologics may form or contain particulates or have other issues or problems after storage which may require products to be destroyed or recalled. While we expect to write off small amounts of work-in-progress in the ordinary course of business due to the complex nature of plasma, our processes and our products, unanticipated events may lead to write-offs and other costs materially in excess of our expectations and the reserves we have established for these purposes. Such write-offs and other costs could cause material fluctuations in our results of operations. Product or component quality issues may also result in regulatory enforcement actions, liability, corrective actions and recalls, among other actions, as described elsewhere in this annual report.\nFurthermore, contamination of our products could cause investors, consumers, or other third parties with whom we conduct business to lose confidence in the reliability of our manufacturing procedures, which could adversely affect our revenues. In addition, faulty or contaminated products that are unknowingly distributed could result in patient harm, threaten the reputation of our products and expose us to product liability damages and claims from companies for whom we do contract manufacturing.\nOur ability to continue to produce safe and effective products depends on the safety of our plasma supply, testing by third parties and the timing of receiving the testing results, and manufacturing processes against transmittable diseases.\nDespite overlapping safeguards, including the screening of donors and other steps to remove or inactivate viruses and other infectious disease-causing agents, the risk of transmissible disease through blood plasma products cannot be entirely eliminated. For example, since plasma-derived therapeutics involves the use and purification of human plasma, there has been concern raised about the risk of transmitting HIV, prions, West Nile virus, H1N1 virus or \u201cswine flu\u201d and other blood-borne pathogens through plasma-derived products. There are also concerns about the future transmission of H5N1 virus, or \u201cbird flu.\u201d In the 1980s, thousands of hemophiliacs worldwide were infected with HIV through the use of contaminated Factor VIII. Other producers of Factor VIII, though not us, were defendants in numerous lawsuits resulting from these infections. New infectious diseases emerge in the human population from time to time. If a new infectious disease has a period during which time the causative agent is present in the bloodstream but symptoms are not present, it is possible that plasma donations could be contaminated by that infectious agent. Typically, early in an outbreak of a new disease, tests for the causative agent do not exist. During this early phase, we must rely on screening of donors for behavioral risk factors or physical symptoms to reduce the risk of plasma contamination. Screening methods are generally less sensitive and specific than a direct test as a means of identifying potentially contaminated plasma units. During the early phase of an outbreak of a new infectious disease, our ability to manufacture safe products would depend on the manufacturing process\u2019 capacity to inactivate or remove the infectious agent. To the extent that a product\u2019s manufacturing process is inadequate to inactivate or remove an infectious agent, our ability to manufacture and distribute that product would be impaired. If a new infectious disease were to emerge in the human population, such as COVID-19, or if there were a reemergence of an infectious disease, the regulatory and public health authorities could impose precautions to limit the transmission of the disease that would impair our ability to procure plasma, manufacture our products or both. Such precautionary measures could be taken before there is conclusive medical or scientific evidence that a disease poses a risk for plasma-derived products. In recent years, new testing and viral inactivation methods have been developed that more effectively detect and inactivate infectious viruses in collected plasma. There can be no assurance, however, that such new testing and inactivation methods will adequately screen for, and inactivate, infectious agents in the plasma used in the production of our products.\nWe could become supply-constrained and our financial performance would suffer if we cannot obtain adequate quantities of FDA-approved source plasma with proper specifications or other necessary raw materials.\nIn order for plasma to be used in the manufacturing of our products, the individual centers at which the plasma is collected must generally be licensed by the FDA and approved by the regulatory authorities of any country in which we may wish to commercialize our products. When we open a new plasma center, and on an ongoing basis after licensure, it must be inspected by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements. Therefore, even if we are able to construct new plasma collection centers to complement our current plasma collection facilities, an unsatisfactory inspection could prevent a new center from being licensed or risk the suspension or revocation of an existing license, among other enforcement actions. We do not and will not have adequate plasma to manufacture our products. Therefore, we are reliant on the purchase of plasma from third parties to manufacture our products. We can give no assurances that appropriate plasma will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to manufacture our products. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant constraints in raw material supply across various different industries, including the supply of plasma. It is possible that in the future, the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses thereto will have an adverse effect on our ability to source plasma from donors in quantity and quality sufficient for our manufacturing processes. In order to maintain a plasma center\u2019s license, its operations must continue to conform to cGMP and other regulatory requirements. In the event that we determine that plasma was not collected in compliance with cGMP and other applicable regulatory requirements, we may be unable to use and may ultimately destroy plasma collected from that center, which would be recorded as a charge to cost of product revenue. Additionally, if non-compliance in the plasma collection process is identified after the impacted plasma has been pooled with compliant plasma from other sources, entire plasma pools, in-process intermediate materials and final products could be impacted. Consequently, we could experience significant inventory impairment provisions and write-offs which could adversely affect our business and financial results. We plan to increase our supplies of plasma for use in the manufacturing processes through increased purchases of plasma from third-party suppliers as well as collections from our existing ADMA BioCenters plasma collection facilities. This strategy is dependent upon our ability to maintain a cGMP compliant environment at our plasma collection facilities and to expand production and attract donors to our facilities. There is no assurance that the FDA will inspect and license any of our current or future unlicensed plasma collection facilities in a timely manner consistent with our production plans. If we misjudge the readiness of a center for an FDA inspection, we may lose credibility with the FDA and cause the FDA to more closely examine all of our operations. Such additional scrutiny could materially hamper our operations and our ability to increase plasma collections. Our ability to expand production and increase our plasma collection facilities to more efficient production levels may be affected by changes in the economic environment and population in selected regions where ADMA BioCenters operates its current or future plasma facilities, by the entry of competitive plasma centers into regions where ADMA BioCenters operates such centers, by misjudging the demographic potential of individual regions where ADMA BioCenters expects to expand production and attract new donors, by unexpected facility related challenges, or by unexpected management challenges at selected plasma facilities held by us from time to time.\nOur ability to commercialize our products, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part upon the extent to which reimbursement will be available from governmental agencies, health administration authorities, private health maintenance organizations and health insurers and other healthcare payers, and also depends upon the approval, timing and representations by the FDA or other governmental authorities for our product candidates.\nOur ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if our products sell for inadequate prices or patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of coverage. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products, as well as to the timing, language, specifications and other details pertaining to the approval of such products. Healthcare payers, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Government and other healthcare payers increasingly attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for products. Even if one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA, insurance coverage may not be available, and reimbursement levels may be inadequate, to cover such product. If government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for one of our products, once approved, market acceptance of such product could be reduced. Prices in many countries, including many in Europe, are subject to local regulation and certain pharmaceutical products, such as plasma-derived products, are subject to price controls in several of the world\u2019s principal markets, including many countries within the European Union. In the U.S., where pricing levels for our products are substantially established by third-party payers, including Medicare, if payers reduce the amount of reimbursement for a product, it may cause groups or individuals dispensing the product to discontinue administration of the product, to administer lower doses, to substitute lower cost products or to seek additional price-related concessions. These actions could have a negative effect on our financial results, particularly in cases where our products command a premium price in the marketplace, or where changes in reimbursement induce a shift in the site of treatment. The existence of direct and indirect price controls and pressures over our products could materially adversely affect our financial prospects and performance.\nThe biosimilar pathway established as part of healthcare reform may make it easier for competitors to market biosimilar products.\nThe Healthcare Reform Law introduced an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be biosimilar to an FDA-licensed biological product. A biological product may be demonstrated to be \u201cbiosimilar\u201d if data shows that, among other things, the product is \u201chighly similar\u201d to an already-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and has no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and effectiveness from the reference product. The law provides that a biosimilar application may be submitted as soon as four years after the reference product is first licensed, and that the FDA may not make approval of an application effective until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed. Since the enactment of the law, the FDA has issued several guidance documents to assist sponsors of biosimilar products in preparing their approval applications. Moreover, in an effort to increase competition in the biologic product marketplace, Congress, the executive branch, and the FDA have taken certain legislative and regulatory steps. For example, in 2020 the FDA finalized a guidance to facilitate biologic product importation. The 2020 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act included provisions requiring that sponsors of approved biologic products provide samples of the approved products to persons developing biosimilar products within specified timeframes, in sufficient quantities, and on commercially reasonable market-based terms. The FDA approved the first biosimilar product in 2015 and has since approved a number of biosimilars. As a result of the biosimilar pathway in the U.S., we expect in the future to face greater competition from biosimilar products, including a possible increase in patent challenges.\nThe implementation of the Healthcare Reform Law in the U.S. may adversely affect our business.\nThrough the March 2010 adoption of the Healthcare Reform Law in the U.S., substantial changes are being made to the current system for paying for healthcare in the U.S., including programs to extend medical benefits to millions of individuals who currently lack insurance coverage. This reform establishes significant cost-saving measures with respect to several government healthcare programs, including Medicaid and Medicare Parts B and D, that may cover the cost of our future products, and these efforts could have a material adverse impact on our future financial prospects and performance. For example, in order for a manufacturer\u2019s products to be reimbursed by federal funding under Medicaid, the manufacturer must enter into a Medicaid rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS and pay certain rebates to the states based on utilization data provided by each state to the manufacturer and to CMS and pricing data provided by the manufacturer to the federal government. The states share these savings with the federal government, and sometimes implement their own additional supplemental rebate programs. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, the rebate amount for most branded drug products was previously equal to a minimum of 15.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price (\u201cAMP\u201d) or the AMP less Best Price, whichever is greater, plus the inflation penalty if applicable. Effective January 1, 2010, the Healthcare Reform Law generally increased the size of the Medicaid rebates paid by manufacturers for single source and innovator multiple source (brand name) drug products from a minimum of 15.1% to a minimum of 23.1% of AMP, subject to certain exceptions, plus the inflation penalty if applicable. For non-innovator multiple source (generic) products, the rebate percentage was increased from a minimum of 11.0% to a minimum of 13.0% of AMP, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 established a new inflation penalty for these drugs. In 2010, the Healthcare Reform Law also newly extended the Medicaid drug rebate obligation to prescription drugs covered by Medicaid managed care organizations. These increases in required rebates may adversely affect our future financial prospects and performance. In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As the 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase, and recent regulations have established a civil monetary penalty for failure to refund these overcharges.\nEffective in 2011, the Healthcare Reform Law imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs. These fees may adversely affect our future financial prospects and performance.\nThe Healthcare Reform Law also created new rebate obligations for our products under Medicare Part D, a partial, voluntary prescription drug benefit created by the U.S. federal government primarily for persons 65 years old and over. The Part D drug program is administered through private insurers that contract with CMS. Beginning in 2011, the Healthcare Reform Law generally requires that in order for a drug manufacturer\u2019s products to be reimbursed under Medicare Part D, the manufacturer must enter into a Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program agreement with the Secretary of HHS, and reimburse each Medicare Part D plan sponsor an amount now equal to 70% savings for the manufacturer\u2019s brand name drugs and biologics which the Part D plan sponsor has provided to its Medicare Part D beneficiaries who are in the \u201cdonut hole\u201d (or a gap in Medicare Part D coverage for beneficiaries who have expended certain amounts for drugs). The Part D plan sponsor is responsible for calculating and providing the discount directly to its beneficiaries and for reporting these amounts paid to CMS\u2019s contractor, which notifies drug manufacturers of the rebate amounts it must pay to each Part D plan sponsor. The rebate requirement could adversely affect our future financial performance, particularly if contracts with Part D plans cannot be favorably renegotiated or the Part D plan sponsors fail to accurately calculate payments due in a manner that overstates our rebate obligation. Regarding access to our products, the Healthcare Reform Law established and provided significant funding for a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to coordinate and fund Comparative Effectiveness Research (\u201cCER\u201d). While the stated intent of CER is to develop information to guide providers to the most efficacious therapies, outcomes of CER could influence the reimbursement or coverage for therapies that are determined to be less cost-effective than others. Should any of our products be determined to be less cost effective than alternative therapies, the levels of reimbursement for these products, or the willingness to reimburse at all, could be impacted, which could materially impact our future financial prospects and results.\nThere have been repeated legal challenges and attempts by Congress to repeal or change the Healthcare Reform Law and the possibility of future challenges or legislative changes contribute to the uncertainty of the ongoing implementation and impact of the law and also underscores the potential for additional reform going forward. We cannot assure that the law, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. Certain provisions of enacted or proposed legislative changes may negatively impact coverage and reimbursement of, or rebates paid by manufacturers for, healthcare items and services. We will continue to evaluate the effect that the Healthcare Reform Law and any potential changes may have on our business.\nCorporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nPublic ESG and sustainability reporting is becoming more broadly expected by investors, stockholders and other third parties. Certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and stockholders have developed, and others may in the future develop, scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon ESG or \u201csustainability\u201d metrics. Many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company\u2019s ESG or sustainability scores as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with such company to improve ESG disclosure or performance and may also make voting decisions, or take other actions, to hold these companies and their boards of directors accountable. Board diversity is an ESG topic that is, in particular, receiving heightened attention by investors, stockholders, lawmakers and listing exchanges. Certain states have passed laws requiring companies to meet certain gender and ethnic diversity requirements on their boards of directors. We may face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility initiatives or objectives, including with respect to board diversity, do not meet the standards set by our investors, stockholders, lawmakers, listing exchanges or other constituencies, or if we are unable to achieve an acceptable ESG or sustainability rating from third-party rating services. A low ESG or sustainability rating by a third-party rating service could also result in the exclusion of our common stock from consideration by certain investors who may elect to invest with our competition instead. Ongoing focus on corporate responsibility matters by investors and other parties as described above may impose additional costs or expose us to new risks.\nRisks Relating to our Finances, Capital Requirements and Other Financial Matters\nWe require additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs or commercialization efforts.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had negative cash flows from operations of approximately $112.4 million and $102.0 million, respectively. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on procurement of raw material plasma and other raw materials necessary to scale up our manufacturing operations, commercial product launches, capacity expansion at the Boca Facility and building additional plasma collection facilities. In addition, our end-to-end production cycle from procurement of raw materials to commercial release of finished product can take between seven and 12 months or potentially longer, requiring substantial investments in raw material plasma and other manufacturing materials. We expect that we will not be able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to achieve profitability until the beginning of 2024 and, as a result, we may need to continue to finance our operations through additional equity or debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing agreements. We currently anticipate, based upon our projected revenue and expenditures, that our current cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable, including the proceeds received and expected to be received from the refinancing of our senior credit facility, along with the remaining funds available under the distribution agreement for the sale of our common stock (see \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), will be sufficient to fund our operations, as currently conducted, into the first quarter of 2024, at which time we believe we will begin to generate positive cash flow from operations. This time frame may change based upon how quickly we are able to execute on our commercialization efforts and operational initiatives and whether or not the assumptions underlying our projected revenues and expenses are correct. If we are unable to raise additional capital if needed, including due to widespread liquidity constraints or significant market instability that could result from the COVID-19 pandemic, we will have to delay, curtail or eliminate our commercialization efforts or our product development activities.\nWe may not have cash available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make interest or principal payments on our indebtedness when due.\nThe Hayfin Credit Facility provides for a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $175.0 million, of which $150.0 million has been drawn down and is currently outstanding. Borrowings under the Hayfin Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 9.5% plus the greater of (i) one- or three-month SOFR as we elect and (ii) 1.25%, as more fully described in \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d; provided, however, that upon, and during the continuance of, an Event of Default, the interest rate will automatically increase by an additional 300 basis points. We are currently required to make monthly payments of interest during the term of the Hayfin Credit Facility of approximately $1.1 million, with all principal and unpaid interest due at maturity. The Hayfin Credit Facility has a maturity date of March 23, 2027, subject to acceleration pursuant to the Hayfin Credit Agreement, including upon an Event of Default. All of our obligations under the Hayfin Credit Facility are secured by a first-priority lien and security interest in substantially all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual property, and all of the equity interests in our subsidiaries.\nOur current cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable will not be sufficient to repay all of our current outstanding debt obligations as they mature. If we are unable to obtain additional financing and are otherwise unable to become profitable and generate cash from operations in the amounts necessary to repay our outstanding debt obligations when due, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our creditors would be able to accelerate all of the amounts due and, in the case of the Hayfin Credit Facility, seek to enforce their security interests, which could lead to our creditors taking immediate possession of and selling substantially all of our assets with no return provided to our stockholders.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. Any future debt financing may involve covenants that, among other restrictions, limit our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem or repurchase our common stock, make certain investments or engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements or the disposition of any of our assets, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nOur cash and cash equivalents could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail.\nWe regularly maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit. While we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts on a daily basis and adjust the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit cash fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors\u2019 views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and related rules, our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we have been required to upgrade, and may need to implement further upgrades, to our financial, information and operating systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting and finance staff.\nConsequently, we have incurred increased costs related to our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will continue to do so. Our Audit Committee has retained the services of BDO, a Sarbanes-Oxley advisor, to assist with our internal control over financial reporting and information technology relating to Section 404. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 applicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state NOLs of $299.9 million and $185.0 million, respectively. Federal and State NOLs of approximately $55.2 million and $77.8 million, respectively, will begin to expire at various dates beginning in 2027, if not limited by triggering events prior to such time. Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), changes in our ownership, in certain circumstances, will limit the amount of federal NOLs that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income. In particular, Section 382 of the Code imposes limitations on a company\u2019s ability to use NOLs upon certain changes in such ownership. If we are limited in our ability to use our NOLs in future years in which we have taxable income, we will pay more taxes than if we were able to fully utilize our NOLs. The Biotest Transaction on June 6, 2017 resulted in a change in ownership of ADMA under Section 382 and, as a result, we were required to write off $57.6 million of federal NOLs. On October 25, 2021, we completed a public offering of our common stock whereby we issued 57,500,000 shares of our common stock resulting in another change of ownership for ADMA under section 382 of the Code, resulting in an additional write-off of $3.0 million of federal NOLs, $28.1 million of state NOLs and $1.0 million of research and development credits. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent changes in our stock ownership that we cannot predict or control that could result in further limitations being placed on our ability to utilize our federal NOLs.\nRisks Associated with our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\nOur stock price may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nsales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common stock;\n\u2022\nuncertainties in the equity markets related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure in initiating or completing preclinical or clinical trials or unsatisfactory results of these trials;\n\u2022\ndelay in a decision by federal, state or local business regulatory authority;\n\u2022\nthe timing of acceptance, third-party reimbursement and sales of BIVIGAM and ASCENIV;\n\u2022\nannouncements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals or new product introductions;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our licensors or third-party vendors;\n\u2022\nlitigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nconditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulation and legislation;\n\u2022\noverall market volatility;\n\u2022\nvariations in our anticipated or actual operating results; and\n\u2022\nchange in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of March 18, 2022, most of our 195,920,353 outstanding shares of common stock, as well as a substantial number of shares of our common stock underlying outstanding warrants, were available for sale in the public market, subject to certain restrictions with respect to sales of our common stock by our affiliates, either pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or under effective registration statements. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or adversely affect demand for our common stock.\nOur affiliates control a substantial amount of our shares of common stock. Provisions in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d), our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Perceptive, Stonepine Capital Management, LLC and our directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nclassification of our Board and limitation on filling of vacancies could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, control of our Company; and\n\u2022\nauthorization of the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with such designation rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board, without any need for action by stockholders.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years, has owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition. In addition, as a result of the concentration of ownership of our shares of common stock, our stockholders may, from time to time, observe instances where there may be less liquidity in the public markets for our securities.\nOur Board also recently adopted a short-term stockholder rights agreement with an expiration date of June 15, 2022 and an ownership trigger threshold of 10%. This stockholder rights agreement could render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer or assumption of control of the Company that is not approved by our Board. The rights agreement, however, should not interfere with any merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination approved by our Board. In addition, the rights agreement does not prevent our Board from considering any offer that it considers to be in the best interest of the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. For example, the Hayfin Credit Agreement prohibits us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nIf we fail to adhere to the strict listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), we may be subject to delisting. As a result, our stock price may decline and our common stock may be delisted. If our stock were no longer listed on Nasdaq, the liquidity of our securities likely would be impaired.\nOur Common Stock currently trades on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \u201cADMA.\u201d If we fail to adhere to Nasdaq\u2019s strict listing criteria, including with respect to stock price, market capitalization and stockholders\u2019 equity, our stock may be delisted. This could potentially impair the liquidity of our securities not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price, which may be depressed by the relative illiquidity, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and the potential reduction in media coverage. As a result, an investor might find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock. We believe that current and prospective investors would view an investment in our common stock more favorably if it continues to be listed on Nasdaq. Any failure at any time to meet the Nasdaq continued listing requirements could have an adverse impact on the value and trading activity of our common stock. Although we currently satisfy the listing criteria for Nasdaq, if our stock price declines dramatically, we could be at risk of failing to meet the Nasdaq continued listing criteria.\nPenny stock regulations may affect your ability to sell our common stock.\nBecause the price of our common stock currently trades below $5.00 per share, our common stock is subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers which sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Under these rules, broker-dealers who recommend penny stocks to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to a transaction prior to sale, which includes an acknowledgement that the purchaser\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives forming the basis for the broker-dealer\u2019s suitability determination are accurately stated in such written agreement. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the associated risks. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock and may make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them.\nOur Board may, without stockholder approval, issue and fix the terms of shares of preferred stock and issue additional shares of common stock adversely affecting the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with such designation rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board. Currently, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2021, there were 87,241,078 shares remaining available for issuance, after giving effect to 16,876,015 shares of our common stock that were subject to outstanding stock options, RSUs and warrants as of December 31, 2021 that may be issued by us without stockholder approval, as well as an additional 69,090 shares reserved for the future issuance of awards under our equity compensation plans.", "PERMNO": 15056, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ADMA"}
