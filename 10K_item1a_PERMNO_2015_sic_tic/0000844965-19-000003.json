Risk Factors.\nCertain Business Risks\nAlthough it is not possible to identify all of the risks we encounter, we have identified the following significant risk factors that could affect our actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from any such results that might be projected, forecasted, or estimated by us in this report.\nMarket Risks\nThe demand and prices for our products and services are affected by several factors, including the supply, demand, and prices for oil and natural gas.\nDemand for our services and products is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. The level of exploration, development, and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to\nlarge fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control.\nThe reduction in oil and natural gas prices that began in 2014 and continued through 2015 and 2016 resulted in declining demand for certain of our products and services compared to 2014 levels. Although oil prices steadily increased during late 2017 and early 2018, they fell during the fourth quarter of 2018, with 2018 West Texas Intermediate oil prices dropping from a high of $76.90 per barrel in October 2018 to a low of $42.36 per barrel in December 2018. The West Texas Intermediate price was $55.80 per barrel as of March 1, 2019. U.S. natural gas prices have also been volatile over the past three years, with the Henry Hub price ranging from a low of $1.61 per million British thermal units (\u201cMMBtu\u201d) in March 2016 to a high of $4.93 per MMBtu in November 2018. The Henry Hub price for natural gas as of March 1, 2019 was $2.86 per MMBtu. For more information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Overview and Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices depressed levels of exploration, development, and production activity in 2015 and 2016, and if current oil and natural gas prices remain depressed or further decline, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Should current market conditions worsen for an extended period of time, we may be required to record additional asset impairments. Such potential impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. Even forecasts of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies, including current concerns caused by the drop in oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2018, can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects.\nFactors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include: the level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas; governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves; weather conditions and natural disasters; worldwide political, military, and economic conditions; the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") to set and maintain oil production levels; the levels of oil production by non-OPEC countries; oil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas; the cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas; and potential acceleration of the development of alternative fuels.\nCurrent debt and equity market conditions may continue to limit our ability, and the ability of our CCLP subsidiary, to obtain additional financing, including to pursue other business opportunities.\nCurrent conditions in the market for debt and equity securities in the energy sector have increased the difficulty of obtaining debt or equity financing to grow our and CCLP's businesses. As of December 31, 2018, the market price for our common stock was $1.68 per share and the market price per common unit of CCLP was $2.32, reflecting steep declines during the fourth quarter of 2018. As of March 1, 2019, the price of our common stock and the price of the common units of CCLP were $2.48 and $3.10, respectively. At the current price for our common stock, acquisition and financing transactions that involve the use of our common equity may be significantly dilutive to our stockholders. The issuance of new convertible debt or equity securities (similar to the Series A Convertible Preferred Units of CCLP that were issued in late 2016 (the \"CCLP Preferred Units\")) in the future for acquisition and financing transactions, if available, could be significantly dilutive to current common unitholders. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, CCLP had approximately $645.9 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under its 7.25% Senior Notes and 7.50% Senior Secured Notes. Obtaining equity or debt financing in the current market environment is particularly difficult for CCLP, given its current levels of long-term debt.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, CCLP's total capital expenditures were $103.5 million, primarily consisting of growth capital expenditures to increase its compression services equipment fleet. The majority of these capital expenditures were funded through the issuance of long-term debt during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, CCLP's total cash balance was $15.9 million. CCLP expects that the combination of this $15.9 million of cash on hand at the beginning of 2019, operating cash flows expected to be generated during the year, and financing transactions with TETRA will be sufficient to fund its anticipated 2019 capital expenditures without having to access the debt or equity markets. However, CCLP's ability to grow its business through capital expenditure or acquisition activities beyond these sources of financing may be significantly limited or curtailed. Without the ability to increase CCLP's compression equipment fleet or otherwise grow its operations, CCLP's ability to continue to retain customers whose compression services needs are expanding and to increase distributions to its common unitholders, including us, in the future may be limited.\nWe encounter, and expect to continue to encounter, intense competition in the sale of our products and services.\nWe compete with numerous companies in each of our operating segments, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. Certain of our competitors have lower standards of quality, and offer equipment and services at lower prices than we do. Other competitors have newer equipment that is better suited to our customers' needs. Particularly during a period of low oil and natural gas pricing, to the extent competitors offer products or services at lower prices or higher quality, or more cost-effective products or services, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, certain of our customers may elect to perform services internally in lieu of using our services, which could also materially and adversely affect our operations.\nThe profitability of our operations is dependent on other numerous factors beyond our control.\nOur operating results in general, and gross profit in particular, are determined by market conditions and the products and services we sell in any period. Other factors, such as heightened competition, changes in sales and distribution channels, availability of skilled labor and contract services, shortages in raw materials, or inability to obtain supplies at reasonable prices, may also affect the cost of sales and the fluctuation of gross margin in future periods.\nOther factors affecting our operating results and activity levels include oil and natural gas industry spending levels for exploration, completion, production, development, and acquisition activities, and impairments of long-lived assets. In particular, Completion Fluids & Products Division profitability in future periods will continue to be affected by the mix of its products and services, including the timing of TETRA CS Neptune completion fluid projects, which are also dependent upon the success of customer offshore exploration and drilling efforts. Several of our customers reduced their capital expenditures during 2016 and 2017 in light of the significant declines in the prices of oil and natural gas, and the decline in oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2018, if sustained, could have a similar impact to 2019 industry capital expenditures. Such industry capital expenditure reductions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative effect on the demand for many of our products and services. This has had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our revenues and results of operations. A large concentration of our operating activities is located in the Permian Basin region of Texas and New Mexico. Our revenues and profitability are particularly dependent upon oil and natural gas industry activity and spending levels in this region. Our operations may also be affected by technological advances, cost of capital, and tax policies. Adverse changes in any of these other factors may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nChanges in the economic environment have resulted, and could further result, in significant impairments of certain of our long-lived assets and goodwill.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, we recorded consolidated long-lived asset impairments (excluding goodwill impairments) of approximately $10.7 million. During the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of the impact of significant decreases in oil and natural gas prices on certain of our long-lived assets, we recorded consolidated long-lived asset impairments of approximately $7.2 million. During the fourth quarter of 2017, consolidated long-lived asset impairments of approximately $14.9 million were recorded primarily due to the impairment of a certain identified intangible asset resulting from decreased expected future operating cash flows from a Water & Flowback Services Division customer. During the third quarter of 2018, as a result of decreased expected future cash flows from a specific customer contract, we recorded a long-lived asset impairment of $2.9 million of an identified intangible asset within the Water & Flowback Services segment. During the two year period ending December 31, 2018, we have recorded a total of $18.5 million of impairments and other charges. Depressed commodity prices and/or adverse changes in the economic environment could result in a greater decrease in the demand for many of our products and services, which could impact the expected utilization rates of certain of our long-lived assets, including plant facilities, operating locations, and other operating equipment. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we review the carrying value of our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, based on their expected future cash flows. The impact of reduced expected future cash flow could require the write-down of all or a portion of the carrying value for these assets, which would result in additional impairments, resulting in decreased earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our consolidated goodwill consists of the $25.9 million of goodwill attributed to our Water Management reporting unit, as part of our Water & Flowback Services Division. Under U.S. GAAP, we review the carrying value of our goodwill for possible impairment annually or when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Changes in circumstances indicating the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price or future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. If economic and market conditions decline, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations. Specific uncertainties affecting the estimated fair value of our Water Management reporting unit includes the impact of competition, prices of oil and natural gas, and future overall activity levels in the regions in which we operate, the activity levels of our significant customers, and other factors affecting the rate of future growth of this reporting unit. These factors will continue to be reviewed and assessed going forward. Negative developments with regard to these factors could have a further negative effect on the fair value of the Water Management reporting unit, resulting in the impairment of all or a portion of goodwill.\nWe are dependent on third-party suppliers for specific products and equipment necessary to provide certain of our products and services.\nWe sell a variety of CBFs to the oil and gas industry and non-energy markets, including calcium chloride, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, sodium bromide, and formate-based brines, some of which we manufacture and some of which are purchased from third parties. Sales of these products contribute significantly to our revenues. In our manufacture of calcium chloride, we use brines, hydrochloric acid, and other raw materials purchased from third parties. In our manufacture of brominated CBF products, we use elemental bromine, hydrobromic acid, and other raw materials that are purchased from third parties. We rely on Lanxess as a supplier of bromine for our brominated CBF products as well as tail brine for our El Dorado, Arkansas, calcium chloride plant. Although we have long-term supply agreements with Lanxess, if we were unable to acquire these raw materials at reasonable prices for a prolonged period, our Completion Fluids & Products Division business could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe fabrication of CCLP's compression packages and our production testing, well monitoring, and rig cooling equipment requires the purchase of various components, some of which we obtain from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers exposes us to the risk of price increases, inferior component quality, or an inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner. The profitability or future growth of our Compression and Water & Flowback Services Divisions may be adversely affected due to our dependence on these key suppliers.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace, and the continued ability to attract new employees.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, train, and retain skilled management and employees at reasonable compensation levels. The delivery of our products and services requires personnel with specialized skills and experience. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled managers and workers in the U.S. Gulf Coast region and other regions in which we operate is high and the supply is limited. A lack of qualified personnel, could adversely affect operating results.\nThe demand for our products and services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could continue to be adversely impacted by increased regulation and continuing regulatory uncertainty.\nOperations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have been subject to an increasingly stringent regulatory environment including government regulations focused on offshore operating requirements, spill cleanup, and enforcement matters. These regulations also implement additional safety and certification requirements applicable to offshore activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Demand for the products and services of our Completion Fluids & Products Division in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico continues to be affected by these regulations. Future regulatory requirements could delay our customers\u2019 activities, reduce our revenues, and increase our operating costs, including the cost to insure offshore operations, resulting in reduced cash flows and profitability.\nOperating, Technological, and Strategic Risks\nWe may not fully realize the benefits from the SwiftWater or JRGO acquisitions.\nOn February 28, 2018, we purchased all of the equity interests in SwiftWater, which is engaged in the business of providing water management and water solutions to oil and gas operators in the Permian Basin market.\nOn December 6, 2018, we purchased the equity interests of JRGO, which specializes in delivering comprehensive water management services, including containment solutions, for oil and gas operators in the Appalachian region of the U.S.\nWe performed an inspection of each entity's assets and liabilities, which we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. However, there could be unknown liabilities or other problems that are not necessarily observable even when the inspection is undertaken. If problems are identified of the SwiftWater and JRGO acquisitions, we may have limited recourse.\nWe have technological and age-obsolescence risk, both with our products and services as well as with our equipment assets.\nNew drilling, completion, and production technologies and equipment are constantly evolving. If we are unable to adapt to new advances in technology or replace older assets with new assets, we are at risk of losing customers and market share. Certain equipment, such as a portion of our production testing equipment fleet, may be inadequate to meet the needs of our customers in certain markets. The permanent replacement or upgrade of any of our equipment will require significant capital. Due to the unique nature of many of these assets, finding a suitable or acceptable replacement may be difficult and/or cost prohibitive. The replacement or enhancement of these assets over the next several years may be necessary in order for us to effectively compete in the current marketplace.\nWe face risks related to our long-term growth strategy.\nOur long-term growth strategy includes both internal growth and growth through acquisitions. Internal growth may require significant capital expenditures, some of which may become unrecoverable or fail to generate an acceptable level of cash flows. Internal growth also requires financial resources (including the use of available cash or additional long-term debt), management, and personnel resources. Acquisitions also require significant management resources, both at the time of the transaction and during the process of integrating the newly acquired business into our operations. Acquisitions could adversely affect our operations if we are unable to successfully integrate the newly acquired operations into our existing operations, are unable to hire adequate personnel, or are unable to retain existing personnel. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms. Acquisition or internal growth assumptions developed to support our decisions could prove to be overly optimistic. Future acquisitions by us could result in issuances of equity securities or the rights associated with the equity securities, which could potentially dilute earnings per share. Future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt or contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. These factors could adversely affect our future operating results and financial position.\nOur operations involve significant operating risks and insurance coverage may not be available or cost-effective.\nWe are subject to operating hazards normally associated with the oilfield service industry, including automobile accidents, fires, explosions, blowouts, formation collapse, mechanical problems, abnormally pressured formations, and environmental accidents. Environmental accidents could include, but are not limited to oil spills, gas leaks or ruptures, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, or well fluids, or discharges of CBFs or toxic gases or other pollutants. These operating hazards may also include injuries to employees and third parties during the performance of our operations. In the past, our Compression Division has on occasion experienced fires that have damaged or destroyed certain of its compression fleet, and similar accidents or fires could reoccur in the future.\nWe have maintained a policy of insuring our risks of operational hazards that we believe is customary in the industry. We believe that the limits of insurance coverage we have purchased are consistent with the exposures we face and the nature of our products and services. Due to economic conditions in the insurance industry, from time to time, we have increased our self-insured retentions for certain policies in order to minimize the increased costs of coverage, or we have reduced our limits of insurance coverage for, or not procured, named windstorm coverage. In certain areas of our business, we, from time to time, have elected to assume the risk of loss for specific assets. To the extent we suffer losses or claims that are not covered, or are only partially covered by insurance, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWeather-Related Risks\nCertain of our operations are seasonal and depend, in part, on weather conditions.\nIn certain markets, the Water & Flowback Services Division\u2019s onshore water management services can be dependent on adequate water supplies being available to its customers. To the extent severe drought or other weather-related conditions prevent our customers from obtaining needed water, frac water operations may not be possible and our Water & Flowback Services Division business may be negatively affected.\nSevere weather, including named windstorms, can cause damage and disruption to our businesses.\nA portion of our operations is susceptible to adverse weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico, including hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions. Even if we do not experience direct damage from storms, we may experience disruptions in our operations, because we are unable to operate or our customers or suppliers may curtail their activities due to damage to their wells, platforms, pipelines, and facilities. From time to time, our onshore operations are also negatively affected by adverse weather conditions, including sustained rain and flooding.\nFinancial Risks\nOur long-term debt agreements contain covenants and other provisions that restrict our ability to take certain actions and may limit our ability to grow our business in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our total long-term debt outstanding (excluding CCLP) of $182.5 million consisted of the carrying amount outstanding under our credit agreement (the \u201cTerm Credit Agreement\u201d) and our Asset-Based Credit Agreement (the \"ABL Credit Agreement\"), both of which we entered into in September 2018. In addition, in June 2018, CCLP entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \"CCLP Credit Agreement\"), although there was no balance outstanding under the CCLP Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our consolidated balance sheet includes $633.0 million carrying amount of long-term debt of CCLP, which consisted of (i) $343.2 million carrying amount under its 7.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the \"CCLP 7.50% Senior Secured Notes\"), and (ii) $289.8 million carrying amount of CCLP's 7.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes\"). Debt service costs related to outstanding long-term debt represents a significant use of our and CCLP's operating cash flows and could increase our and CCLP's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of TETRA and certain of its subsidiaries (other than CCLP) to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, (i) incurring debt, (ii) granting liens, (iii) engaging in mergers and other fundamental changes, (iv) making investments, (v) entering into, or amending, transactions with affiliates, (vi) paying dividends and making other restricted payments, (vii) prepaying other indebtedness, and (viii) selling assets. The ABL Credit Agreement also contains a provision that may require a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 in the event that certain conditions associated with outstanding borrowings and cash availability occur. The Term Credit Agreement also contains a requirement that the borrowers comply at the end of each fiscal quarter with a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Credit Agreement) of 1.00 to 1.00.\nThe CCLP Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the CCLP's ability to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, (i) incurring debt, (ii) granting liens, (iii) making investments, (iv) entering into or amending transactions with affiliates, (v) paying dividends, and (vi) selling assets. The CCLP Credit Agreement also contains a provision that requires compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the CCLP Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 in the event that certain conditions associated with outstanding borrowings and cash availability occur.\nIn addition, the indentures governing the CCLP 7.50% Senior Secured Notes and the CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes (the \"CCLP Indentures\") contain customary covenants restricting CCLP's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to (i) pay distributions on, purchase, or redeem its common units, make certain investments and other restricted payments, or purchase or redeem any subordinated debt; (ii) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain kinds of preferred equity securities; (iii) create or incur certain liens securing indebtedness; (iv) sell\nassets, including dispositions of the CCLP 7.50% Senior Secured Notes Collateral; (v) consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets; (vi) enter into, or amend or modify transactions with affiliates; and (vii) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from CCLP's restricted subsidiaries to CCLP. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions, including certain provisions permitting CCLP, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to transfer assets to certain of its unrestricted subsidiaries.\nOur continuing ability to comply with covenants in our Long-Term Debt Agreements depends largely upon our ability to generate adequate earnings and operating cash flow.\nThe debt levels of our CCLP subsidiary have resulted in a significant use of its operating cash flows being used to fund debt service requirements, resulting in less cash available for distributions.\nIn March 2018, CCLP issued an aggregate $350.0 million of its 7.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the \"CCLP 7.50% Senior Secured Notes\"), the proceeds from which were partially used to repay the remaining outstanding balance of $258.0 million under CCLP's previous bank credit facility, which was then terminated. While the termination of the CCLP previous bank credit agreement removed certain financial covenant requirements, the issuance of the 7.50% Senior Secured Notes increased CCLP's aggregate amount of long-term debt outstanding as well as increased the aggregate interest rate of its debt outstanding. This increase in CCLP indebtedness has increased its total interest expense, which in turn reduces its cash available to fund capital expenditures or for distribution to CCLP's common unitholders, including us. CCLP's ability to service its indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond its control. If CCLP operating results are not sufficient to service its current or future indebtedness, CCLP may be forced to consider taking actions such as reducing or delaying is business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, delaying the increase of distributions, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing its indebtedness, or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. CCLP may not be able to take any of these courses of action.\nOn December 20, 2018, CCLP announced that, given the decline in its common unit price, it was reducing its common unit distributions from $0.75 per unit per year (or $0.1875 per quarter) to $0.04 per unit per year (or $0.01 per quarter) for a period of up to four quarters, beginning with the February 2019 distribution. CCLP intends to use the approximately $34 million of the savings from the reduced distribution to redeem the remaining CCLP Preferred Units for cash and avoid the dilution to its common unitholders that would occur if the CCLP Preferred Units were converted into common units. Given its need to fund capital expenditures and debt service requirements, there can be no assurance that CCLP will increase its distributions to its common unitholders, including us, following the redemption of the CCLP Preferred Units.\nWe have continuing exposure to abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with oil and gas properties previously owned by Maritech.\nFrom 2001 to 2012, Maritech sold oil and gas producing properties in numerous transactions to different buyers. In connection with those sales, the buyers assumed the decommissioning liabilities associated with the properties sold (the \"Legacy Liabilities\") and generally became the successor operator. Some buyers of these Maritech properties subsequently sold certain of these properties to other buyers, who also assumed the financial responsibilities associated with the properties' operations, and these buyers also typically became the successor operator of the properties. To the extent that a buyer of these properties fails to perform the abandonment and decommissioning work required, a previous owner, including Maritech, may be required to perform the abandonment and decommissioning obligation. As the former parent company of Maritech, we also may be responsible for performing these abandonment and decommissioning obligations. A significant portion of the decommissioning liabilities that were assumed by the buyers of the Maritech properties in these previous sales remains unperformed, and we believe the amounts of these remaining liabilities are significant. We generally monitor the financial condition of the buyers of these properties, and if oil and natural gas pricing levels deteriorate, we expect that one or more of these buyers may be unable to perform the decommissioning work required on properties they acquired, either directly or indirectly from Maritech.\nIn March 2018, pursuant to a series of transactions, Maritech completed the sales of the remaining active leases held by Maritech to Orinoco Natural Resources, LLC (\"Orinoco\") and, immediately thereafter, we sold all\nequity interest in Maritech to Orinoco. Under the Maritech Asset Purchase Agreement, Orinoco assumed all of Maritech's abandonment and decommissioning obligations related to the active leases (the \u201cOrinoco Lease Liabilities\u201d) and under the Maritech Equity Purchase Agreement Orinoco assumed all other liabilities of Maritech, including the Legacy Liabilities, subject to limited exceptions unrelated to the asset retirement obligations. Pursuant to a Bonding Agreement executed in connection with such purchase agreements, Orinoco provided non-revocable bonds in the aggregate amount of $47.0 million to secure their performance of Maritech\u2019s abandonment and decommissioning obligations related to the Orinoco Lease Liabilities and Maritech\u2019s remaining current abandonment and decommissioning obligations (not including the Legacy Liabilities). Orinoco was required to replace, within 90 days following the closing, the initial bonds delivered at closing with non-revocable performance bonds, meeting certain requirements, in the aggregate sum of $47.0 million. Orinoco has not delivered such replacement bonds and we are seeking to enforce the terms of the Bonding Agreement. The non-revocable performance bonds delivered at the closing remain in effect.\nIf in the future we become liable for any abandonment and decommissioning liability associated with any property previously owned by Maritech other than the Legacy Liabilities, the Bonding Agreement provides that, if we call any of these bonds to satisfy such liability and the amount of the bond payment is not sufficient to pay for such liability, Orinoco will pay us for the additional amount required. To the extent Orinoco is unable to cover any such deficiency or we become liable for a significant portion of the Legacy Liabilities, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nWe are exposed to significant credit risks.\nWe face credit risk associated with the significant amounts of accounts receivable we have with our customers in the energy industry. Many of our customers, particularly those associated with our onshore operations, are small- to medium-sized oil and gas operators that may be more susceptible to declines in oil and gas commodity prices or generally increased operating expenses than larger companies. Our ability to collect from our customers is impacted by the current volatile oil and natural gas price environment.\nOur operating results and cash flows for certain of our subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency risk.\nThe operations of certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and certain foreign currencies, particularly the euro, the British pound, the Mexican peso, and the Argentinian peso. Our plans to grow our international operations could cause this exposure from fluctuating currencies to increase. Historically, exchange rates of foreign currencies have fluctuated significantly compared to the U.S. dollar, and this exchange rate volatility is expected to continue. Significant fluctuations in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could adversely affect our balance sheet and results of operations.\nIf the remaining CCLP Preferred Units are not redeemed for cash, as intended, the result would be the issuance of additional CCLP common units in the future, resulting in potential dilution of our existing common unit ownership in CCLP.\nCCLP's partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional common units that CCLP may issue at any time without the approval of its common unitholders. In addition, subject to the provisions of the CCLP Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreements (the \u201cCCLP Unit Purchase Agreements\u201d), CCLP may issue an unlimited number of partnership units that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation, or voting. On August 8, 2016, CCLP issued an aggregate of 4,374,454 of CCLP Preferred Units for a cash purchase price of $11.43 per CCLP Preferred Unit (the \u201cIssue Price\u201d), resulting in total net proceeds, after deducting certain offering expenses, of $49.8 million. We purchased 874,891 of the CCLP Preferred Units at the Issue Price, for a purchase price of $10.0 million. Additionally, on September 20, 2016, CCLP issued an aggregate of 2,624,672 of CCLP Preferred Units for a cash purchase price of $11.43 per Preferred Unit, resulting in total net proceeds, after deducting certain offering expenses, of $29.0 million.\nPursuant to the initial CCLP Unit Purchase Agreement dated August 8, 2016, our wholly owned CSI Compressco GP Inc. subsidiary (the general partner of CCLP), executed the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the \u201cAmended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement\u201d) to, among other things, authorize and establish the rights and preferences of the CCLP Preferred Units. The CCLP Preferred Units are a new class of equity security that ranks senior to CCLP's common units with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation. The holders of CCLP Preferred Units (each, a \u201cCCLP Preferred Unitholder\u201d) will receive quarterly distributions in kind in additional CCLP Preferred Units, equal to an annual rate of\n11.00% of the Issue Price ($1.2573 per unit annualized), subject to certain adjustments, including adjustments relating to any future issuances of common units below a set price, and any quarterly distributions on our common units in excess of $0.3775 per common unit. In the event CCLP fails to pay in full any quarterly distribution in additional CCLP Preferred Units, then until such failure is cured, CCLP is prohibited from making any distributions on its common units. Beginning March 8, 2017 and on the first trading day of each calendar month thereafter for a total of thirty months (each, a \u201cConversion Date\u201d), the CCLP Preferred Units convert into common units in an amount equal to, with respect to each CCLP Preferred Unitholder, the number of CCLP Preferred Units held by such CCLP Preferred Unitholder divided by the number of Conversion Dates remaining. On June 7, 2017, as permitted under the Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement, CCLP elected to defer the monthly conversion of CCLP Preferred Units for each of the Conversion Dates during the three month period beginning July 2017. As a result, no CCLP Preferred Units were converted into CCLP common units during the three month period ended September 30, 2017, and future monthly conversions were increased beginning in October 2017. During 2018, conversions of the CCLP Preferred Units resulted in the issuance of approximately 8.0 million CCLP common units. CCLP may, at its option, pay cash, or a combination of cash and common units, to the CCLP Preferred Unitholders instead of issuing common units on any Conversion Date, subject to certain restrictions as described in the Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement and the CCLP Credit Agreement.\nOn December 20, 2018, CCLP announced that, given the decline in its common unit price, CCLP was reducing its common unit distributions from $0.75 per unit per year (or $0.1875 per quarter) to $0.04 per unit per year (or $0.01 per quarter) for a period of up to four quarters, beginning with the February 2019 distribution. CCLP intends to use the approximately $34 million of savings from the reduced distribution to redeem the remaining CCLP Preferred Units for cash and avoid the dilution to its common unitholders that would occur if the CCLP Preferred Units were converted into common units at a low unit price. However, there is no guarantee that CCLP will be able to fully redeem the remaining CCLP Preferred Units for cash and that additional dilution will not occur.\nIf the remaining CCLP Preferred Units are not redeemed for cash, as intended, the result would be common units issued upon conversion thereof, resulting in dilution of our common unit ownership in CCLP.\nWe and CCLP are exposed to interest rate risks with regard to our respective credit facility indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $0.0 million outstanding under our ABL Credit Agreement and $182.5 million outstanding under our Term Credit Agreement. CCLP has a total of $0.0 million outstanding under the CCLP Credit Agreement. These credit facilities consist of floating rate loans that bear interest at an agreed upon percentage rate spread above London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or an alternate base rate. Accordingly, whenever we or CCLP have amounts outstanding under these facilities, our and CCLP's cash flows and results of operations could be subject to interest rate risk exposure associated with the level of the variable rate debt balance outstanding. We currently are not a party to an interest rate swap contract or other derivative instrument designed to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuation risk.\nOur ABL Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature on September 10, 2023. Our Term Loan Agreement is scheduled to mature on September 10, 2025. The CCLP Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature on June 29, 2023. CCLP's 7.25% Senior Notes, which mature August 15, 2022, and CCLP's 7.50% Senior Secured Notes, which mature April 1, 2025, bear interest at fixed interest rates. There can be no assurance that the financial market conditions or borrowing terms at the times these existing debt agreements are renegotiated will be as favorable as the current terms and interest rates.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Political Risks\nOur operations are subject to extensive and evolving U.S. and foreign federal, state and local laws and regulatory requirements that increase our operating costs and expose us to potential fines, penalties, and litigation.\nLaws and regulations govern our operations, including those relating to corporate governance, employees, taxation, fees, importation and exportation restrictions, environmental affairs, health and safety, and the manufacture, storage, handling, transportation, use, and sale of chemical products. Certain foreign countries impose additional restrictions on our activities, such as currency restrictions and restrictions on various labor practices. These laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex and stringent, and compliance is becoming increasingly expensive. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations, and violators are subject to civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, and injunctions. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance with certain laws and regulations. It is\npossible that increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us.\nThe EPA is studying the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing, a process used by the U.S. oil and gas industry in the development of certain oil and gas reservoirs. Specifically, the EPA is reviewing the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. Certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. Several states have adopted regulations that require operators to disclose the chemical constituents in hydraulic fracturing fluids. We cannot predict whether any federal, state or local laws or regulations will be enacted regarding hydraulic fracturing, and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on oil and gas operators through the adoption of new laws and regulations, the domestic demand for certain of our products and services could be decreased or subject to delays, particularly for our Water & Flowback Services, Compression, and Completion Fluids & Products Divisions.\nWe have operations that are either ongoing or scheduled to commence in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. At this time, we cannot predict the full impact that other regulatory actions that may be mandated by the federal government may have on our operations or the operations of our customers. Other governmental or regulatory actions could further reduce our revenues and increase our operating costs, including the cost to insure offshore operations, resulting in reduced cash flows and profitability.\nOur onshore and offshore operations expose us to risks such as the potential for harmful substances escaping into the environment and causing damages or injuries, which could be substantial. Although we maintain general liability and pollution liability insurance, these policies are subject to exceptions and coverage limits. We maintain limited environmental liability insurance covering named locations and environmental risks associated with contract services for oil and gas operations. We could be materially and adversely affected by an enforcement proceeding or a claim that is not covered or is only partially covered by insurance.\nBecause our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements that impose additional restrictions on the industry may adversely affect our financial results. Regulators are becoming more focused on air emissions from oil and gas operations, including volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and greenhouse gases (\"GHGs\"). In particular, the focus on GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our financial results if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or otherwise result in reduced economic activity generally. In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs, capital spending requirements, or additional operating restrictions for us, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.\nIn addition to increasing our risk of environmental liability, the rigorous enforcement of environmental laws and regulations has accelerated the growth of some of the markets we serve.\nOur expansion into foreign countries exposes us to complex regulations and may present us with new obstacles to growth.\nWe plan to continue to grow both in the United States and in foreign countries. We have established operations in, among other countries, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Finland, Ghana, Mexico, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Foreign operations carry special risks. Our business in the countries in which we currently operate and those in which we may operate in the future could be limited or disrupted by:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriating cash back to the United States;\n\u2022\nthe impact of compliance with anti-corruption laws on our operations and competitive position in affected countries and the risk that actions taken by us or our agents may violate those laws;\n\u2022\ngovernment controls and government actions, such as expropriation of assets and changes in legal and regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nimport and export license requirements;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs and taxes; and\n\u2022\nour limited knowledge of these markets or our inability to protect our interests.\nWe and our affiliates operate in countries where governmental corruption has been known to exist. While we and our subsidiaries are committed to conducting business in a legal and ethical manner, there is a risk of violating either the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K Bribery Act, or laws or legislation promulgated pursuant to the 1997 OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions or other applicable anti-corruption regulations that generally prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. Violation of these laws could result in monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.\nForeign governments and agencies often establish permit and regulatory standards different from those in the U.S. If we cannot obtain foreign regulatory approvals, or if we cannot obtain them in a timely manner, our growth and profitability from foreign operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operations in Argentina expose us to the changing economic, legal, and political environments in that country, including the changing regulations over repatriation of cash generated from our operations in Argentina.\nThe current economic, legal, and political environment in Argentina and recent devaluation of the Argentinian peso have created increased economic instability for foreign investment in Argentina. The Argentinian government is currently attempting to address the current high rate of inflation and the continuing devaluations pressure. Fiscal and monetary expansion in Argentina has led to devaluations of the Argentinian peso, particularly in late 2013, early 2014, and late 2015. Additional currency adjustment may be necessary to help boost the current Argentina economy, but may be accompanied by fiscal and monetary tightening, including additional restrictions on the purchase of U.S. dollars in Argentina. On June 30, 2018, we determined the economy in Argentina to be highly inflationary. As a result of this determination and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, on July 1, 2018, the functional currency of our operations in Argentina was changed from the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. The remeasurement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nAs a result of our operations in Argentina, consolidated revenues and operating cash flow generated in Argentina have increased over the past three years. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $0.9 million of our consolidated cash balance is located in Argentina, and the process of repatriating this cash to the U.S. is subject to increasingly complex regulations. There can be no assurances that our growing Argentinian operations will not expose us to a loss of liquidity, foreign exchange losses, and other potential financial impacts.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt production and cause us to incur costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nThe EPA has determined that GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. Such EPA rules regulate GHG emissions under the CAA and require a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and from certain large stationary sources. The EPA rules also require so-called \u201cgreen\u201d completions at hydraulically fractured natural gas wells beginning in 2015. In addition, the EPA also requires the annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, including petroleum refineries, as well as from certain oil and gas production facilities.\nThe EPA has adopted regulations under the CAA to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from reciprocal internal combustion engines and more recently the EPA adopted regulations that establish air emission controls for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, processing and transportation activities, including NSPS as well as emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants. Certain CCLP compressor packages are subject to these new requirements and additional control equipment and maintenance operations are required. While we do not believe that compliance with current regulatory requirements will have a material adverse effect on the business, additional regulations could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements on our equipment that could require us to incur material costs.\nIn addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global GHG emissions (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d). The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 170 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the Paris Agreement. However, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or a separate agreement. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States\u2019 intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. To the extent that the United States and other countries implement the Paris Agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our facilities and operations could require us to incur costs. Further, U.S. Congress (\"Congress\") has considered and almost one-half of the states have adopted legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of GHGs from a wide range of sources. Any such legislation could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce and, in turn, demand for our products and services. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations and cause us to incur costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nRegulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing in the countries where we and our customers operate could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells that may reduce demand for our services.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from dense subsurface rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppants and chemical additives under pressure into targeted geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.\nHydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act Underground Injection Control program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities; published final rules under the federal CAA in 2012 and published additional final regulations in June 2016 governing methane and volatile organic compound performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during for the oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing industry; published in June 2016 an effluent limitations guidelines final rule prohibiting the discharge of waste water from shale natural-gas extraction operations before discharging to a treatment plant; and in 2014 published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. However, in June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule, the BLM appealed the decision to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in July 2016, the appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLM\u2019s issuance of a proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2015 rule and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. In January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM\u2019s rescission of the 2015 rule was brought in federal court, but, in June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule. That decision was appealed by the BLM to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in 2016, but, in March 2017, the BLM filed a request with the Tenth Circuit to put the appeal on hold pending rescission of the 2015 final rule.\nThe Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, some states, including Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, where the drilling program is expected to operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where the drilling program operates, including, for example, on federal and American Indian lands, the partnership could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. \u201cWater cycle\u201d describes the use of water in hydraulic fracturing, from water withdrawals to the making of hydraulic fracturing fluids, through the mixing and injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids in oil and natural gas production wells, to the collection and disposal or reuse of produced water.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for our customers in the production of oil and gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of additional regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our services and increased compliance costs and time, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nRegulatory initiatives relating to the protection of endangered or threatened species in the United States, in other countries where we operate, could have an adverse impact on our and our customers\u2019 ability to expand operations.\nIn the United States, the Endangered Species Act (the \u201cESA\u201d) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (the \u201cMBTA\u201d). To the extent species that are listed under the ESA or similar state laws, or are protected under the MBTA, live in the areas where we or our customers operate, both our and our customers\u2019 abilities to conduct or expand operations and construct facilities could be limited or be forced to incur material additional costs.\nThe designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could indirectly cause us to incur additional costs, cause our or our customers\u2019 operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future development activity in affected areas. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we or our customers might conduct operations could result in limitations or prohibitions on our operations and could adversely impact our business.\nOur proprietary rights may be violated or compromised, which could damage our operations.\nWe own numerous patents, patent applications, and unpatented trade secret technologies in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of these rights. In addition, independent third parties may develop competitive or superior technologies.\nOur operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyberattack.\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, supply chain, customer invoicing, employee information, and other business processes. We outsource certain business process functions to third-party providers and similarly rely on these third parties to maintain and store confidential information on their systems. The failure of these information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our\nbusiness and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.\nAlthough we allocate significant resources to protect our information technology systems, we have experienced varying degrees of cyber-incidents in the normal conduct of our business, including viruses, worms, other destructive software, process breakdowns, phishing and other malicious activities. Such breaches have in the past and could again in the future result in unauthorized access to information including customer, supplier, employee, or other company confidential data. We do not carry insurance against these risks, although we do invest in security technology, perform penetration tests from time to time, and design our business processes to attempt to mitigate the risk of such breaches. However, there can be no assurance that security breaches will not occur. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber security threats and incidents, none of which has been material to us to date. However, a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and subject us to consequences such as litigation and direct costs associated with incident response.", "PERMNO": 76127, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "TTI"}
