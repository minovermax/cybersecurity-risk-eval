The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading ''Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements'' before deciding whether to invest in our securities.\nWe have incurred losses, and these losses may continue.\nWe have incurred losses in each of our fiscal years since inception. There is no assurance that profitability will be achieved in the near term, if at all in the future.\nThe Company operates in highly competitive markets and may be unable to successfully compete against competitors having significantly greater resources and experience.\nOur business may be limited by competition from energy services companies arising from the breakup of conventional regulated electric utilities. Such competitors, both in the equipment and energy services sectors, are likely to have far greater financial and other resources than us, and could possess specialized market knowledge with existing channels of access to prospective customer locations. We may be unable to successfully compete against those competitors\nOur ability to access capital for the repayment of debts and for future growth is limited as the financial markets can be unpredictable.\nOur ability to access capital could be impacted by various factors including general market conditions or a slowdown in the economy, interest rates, the perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any deterioration in the financial position of lenders that might make them unable to meet their obligations to us. We can provide no assurance that capital will be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nBecause unfavorable utility regulations make the installation of our systems more difficult or less economical, any slowdown in the utility deregulation process would be an impediment to the growth of our business.\nIn the past, many electric utility companies have raised opposition to DG, a critical element of our On-Site Utility business. Such resistance has generally taken the form of stringent standards for interconnection and the use of targeted rate structures as disincentives to combined generation of on-site power and heating or cooling services. A DG company's ability to obtain reliable and affordable back-up power through interconnection with the grid is essential to our business model. Utility policies and regulations in most states are often not prepared to accommodate widespread on-site generation. These barriers erected by electric utility companies and unfavorable regulations, where applicable, make more difficult or uneconomic our ability to connect to the electric grid at customer sites and are an impediment to the growth of our business. The development of our business could be adversely affected by any slowdown or reversal in the utility deregulation process or by difficulties in negotiating backup power supply agreements with electric providers in the areas where we intend to do business.\nThe economic viability of our projects depends on the price spread between fuel and electricity, and the variability of the prices of these components creates a risk that our projects will be uneconomic.\nThe economic viability of DG projects is dependent upon the price spread between fuel costs and electricity prices. Volatility in one component of the spread, the cost of natural gas and other fuels (e.g., propane or distillate oil) can be managed to a greater or lesser extent by means of futures contracts. However, the regional rates charged for both base load and peak electricity services may decline periodically due to excess capacity arising from over-building of utility power plants or recessions in economic activity. Any sustained weakness in electricity prices could significantly limit the market for our cogeneration, cooling equipment and On-Site Utility energy services and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nAMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.\nExpiring customer contracts may lead to decreases in revenue and increases in expenses.\nSome of our customer contracts may expire in 2016 which, if not extended, may lead to decreases in revenue. This decrease in revenue will be due to less energy billing. Expiring customer contracts can also lead to an increase in expenses because we will have to remove the equipment at the customer location. We will remove the equipment at our own expense and are obligated to do so at the end of the customer contract.\nEach year, a portion of our customers contracts expire and need to be renewed or replaced. We may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at attractive rates or for the same term as the expiring contracts.\nWe may fail to make sales to certain prospective customers because of resistance from facilities management personnel to the outsourcing of their service function.\nAny outsourcing of non-core activities by institutional or commercial entities will generally lead to reductions in permanent on-site staff employment. As a result, our proposals to implement On-Site Utility contracts are likely to encounter strong initial resistance from the facilities managers whose jobs will be threatened by energy outsourcing. The growth of our business will depend upon our ability to overcome such barriers among prospective customers.\nFuture government regulations, such as increased emissions standards, safety standards and taxes, may adversely impact the economics of our business.\nThe operation of DG equipment at our customers' sites may be subject to future changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations (e.g., emissions, safety, taxes, etc.). Any such new or substantially altered rules and standards may adversely affect our revenues, profits and general financial condition.\nIf we cannot expand our network of skilled technical support personnel, we will be unable to grow our business.\nEach additional customer site for our services requires the initial installation and subsequent maintenance and service of equipment to be provided by a team of technicians skilled in a broad range of technologies, including combustion, instrumentation, heat transfer, information processing, microprocessor controls, fluid systems and other elements of DG. If we are unable to recruit, train, motivate, sub-contract, and retain such personnel in each of the regional markets where our business operates we will be unable to grow our business in those markets.\nFuture technology changes may render obsolete various elements of equipment comprising our On-Site Utility installations.\nWe must select equipment for our DG projects so as to achieve attractive operating efficiencies, while avoiding excessive downtimes from the failure of unproven technologies. If we are unable to achieve a proper balance between the cost, efficiency and reliability of equipment selected for our projects, our growth and profitability will be adversely impacted.\nWe will need to raise additional capital for our business, which will dilute existing stockholders.\nAdditional financings will be required to implement our overall business plan. We will need additional capital. Equity financings will dilute the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Our ability to raise an adequate amount of capital and the terms of any capital that we are able to raise will be dependent upon our progress in implementing demonstration projects and related marketing service development activities. If we do not make adequate progress, we may be unable to raise adequate funds, which will limit our ability to expand our business. If the terms of any equity financings are unfavorable, the dilutive impact on our stockholders might be severe.\nOur revenue from energy billing is partly dependent on the weather and increased temperatures could reduce our revenue.\nIn warmer months the customers are not using as much thermal energy as they do not have as much of a demand to heat their locations. Due to the demand being lower in warmer months we may not be able to bill for thermal energy and in turn may have a decrease in revenue.\nAMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.\nCertain characteristics of specific sites may make it difficult to install and maintain our equipment.\nWhen entering into customer contracts there is a risk that the customer's site will not be well-suited for our equipment. In certain situations, installing and maintaining our equipment at a customer's site may cost more than anticipated, which could lead to an increase in expenses. This has the potential to lead to a decrease in revenue if the site is not capable of running properly.\nOperating diverse on-site utility sites across many different locations presents significant maintenance challenges.\nWe operate 121 systems at various locations which require considerable monitoring and maintenance on a twenty-four hour basis. Managing multiple sites simultaneously creates challenges of engineering resource and spare part availability.\nWe may make acquisitions that could harm our financial performance.\nIn order to expedite development of our corporate infrastructure, particularly with regard to equipment installation and service functions, we anticipate the future acquisition of complementary businesses. Risks associated with such acquisitions include the disruption of our existing operations, loss of key personnel in the acquired companies, dilution through the issuance of additional securities, assumptions of existing liabilities and commitment to further operating expenses. If any or all of these problems actually occur, acquisitions could negatively impact our financial performance and future stock value.\nWe are controlled by a small group of majority stockholders, and our minority stockholders could be unable to effect changes in our governance structure or implement actions that require stockholder approval, such as a sale of the Company.\nGeorge N. Hatsopoulos and John N. Hatsopoulos, who are brothers, together with their families, beneficially own a large portion of our outstanding shares of common stock. These stockholders, with a small group of other major stockholders, have the ability to control various corporate decisions, including our direction and policies, the election of directors, the content of our charter and bylaws and the outcome of any other matter requiring stockholder approval, including a merger, consolidation and sale of substantially all of our assets or other change of control transaction. The concurrence of our minority stockholders will not be required for any of these decisions.\nWe may be exposed to substantial liability claims if we fail to fulfill our obligations to our customers.\nWe enter into contracts with large commercial and not-for-profit customers under which we will assume responsibility for meeting a portion of the customers' building energy demand and equipment installation. We may be exposed to substantial liability claims if we fail to fulfill our obligations to customers. There can be no assurance that we will not be vulnerable to claims by customers and by third parties that are beyond any contractual protections that we are able to negotiate. We may be unable to obtain liability and other insurance on terms and at prices that are commercially acceptable to us. As a result, liability claims could cause us significant financial harm.\nInvestment in our common stock is subject to price fluctuations which have been significant for emerging growth companies like us.\nHistorically, valuations of emerging growth companies have been highly volatile. The securities of many of these companies have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations, unrelated to the operating performance or the prospects of such companies. If the conditions in the equity markets further deteriorate, we may be unable to finance our additional funding needs in the private or the public markets. There can be no assurance that any future offering will be consummated or, if consummated, will be at a share price equal or superior to the price paid by our investors even if we meet our technological and marketing goals.\nFuture sales of common stock by our existing stockholders may cause our stock price to fall.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate and thus inhibit our ability to raise additional capital when it is needed.\nAMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.\nBecause we do not intend to pay cash dividends, our stockholders will receive no current income from holding our stock.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. We currently expect to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business, and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude us from paying any cash dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock could be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nThere are material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer have performed an evaluation of controls and procedures and concluded that our controls were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by our Company in reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. The Company currently has material weaknesses in financial reporting relating to the lack of a sufficient number of controls over manual processes of revenue recognition and impairment calculations. This constitutes a material weakness in financial reporting. Any failure to implement effective internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock, and might require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control system.\nTrading of our common stock is restricted by the Securities and Exchange Commission's, or the SEC's, \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities may be covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and other quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure and suitability requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our capital stock. Trading of our capital stock may be restricted by the SEC's \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.", "PERMNO": 93052, "SIC": 4991, "TIC": "ADGE"}
