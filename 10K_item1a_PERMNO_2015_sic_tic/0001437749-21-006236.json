Set forth below are certain material risks and uncertainties known to us that could adversely effect our business, financial condition, or results of operations or could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations expressed elsewhere in this Annual Report. The occurrence of the events contemplated by one or more of the factors we describe below could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, resulting in the loss of all or part of any investment in our common stock. Furthermore, other risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also, nevertheless, adversely effect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in a way that is material.\nBefore investing in our common stock, you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties, together with all other information in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, the information included in Part II - Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report, and the information incorporated herein by reference.\nRisks Related to the Development, Regulatory Approval, and Commercialization of TSC and Our Other Product Candidates\nThe success of Diffusion is dependent on the successful development, regulatory approval, and, ultimately, commercialization of TSC and our other product candidates. However, the drug development process is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain. Our efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize TSC or any other product candidate could fail at any stage of the development process for a variety of reasons, including the possibility that TSC fails to adequately demonstrate efficacy or proof of concept in the TSC Oxygenation Trials. Furthermore, because the results of preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, even if we are able to advance TSC or another product candidate into additional clinical trials - for example, our Planned Phase 2 Hypoxia-related Indication Trial we intend to commence assuming success in the TSC Oxygenation Trials - we may not continue to experience favorable results.\nThe success of Diffusion, including our ability to finance our operations and generate revenue in the future, will depend primarily on the successful development, regulatory approval, and, ultimately, commercialization of our product candidates. Currently, the majority of our product development resources are dedicated to our lead product candidate, TSC. We are also in early-stage development of our second product candidate, DFN-529, and, in the future, we may also seek to develop or commercialize additional product candidates, including product candidates that we may in-license or acquire to supplement our internally developed portfolio.\nThe drug development process is very expensive, time-consuming, difficult to design and implement, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for commercialization and success in early-stage clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug in a manner adequate to support regulatory approval. Countless other companies, including many with greater resources and experience, have failed or suffered significant setbacks attempting to navigate the drug development process, including failed attempts to develop treatments for hypoxia and indications on the hypoxia-continuum that we may ultimately choose to target with TSC, and there can be no assurance that we will have success where others have failed.\nOur product candidates, including TSC, remain in early stages of the development process and we expect that the additional clinical trials necessary to support an NDA will take several years to complete. We do not know whether the clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety or otherwise provide adequate information to result in regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any particular jurisdiction. Furthermore, the timeline for our clinical trials may be delayed in the future for a variety of reason, including delays related to regulatory and IRB review and approval, slower than anticipated rates of enrollment in or early withdrawals from the trial, third party performance issues beyond our control including any CRO engaged in the conduct of the trial, discovery of series or unexpected toxicities or side effects, or a lack of effectiveness.\nWhether we are able to successfully develop TSC or any of our other product candidates will depend on a large number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to complete our planned and future clinical trials in a timely manner and, with respect to any future trials beyond the TSC Oxygenation Trials and our Planned Phase 2 Hypoxia-related Indication Trial we intend to commence assuming success in the TSC Oxygenation Trials, our ability to fund them;\n\u2022\nour ability to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities, and whether we are required by any such body to conduct additional clinical trials to support approval;\n\u2022\nthe receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, including acceptance of our proposed indications and primary endpoint assessments, marketing approvals, and labeling claims;\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety profile during development and following approval, including the prevalence, duration and severity of potential side effects experienced; and\n\u2022\nour ability to commercialize successfully, including scaling our manufacturing capabilities, the development of sales and marketing capabilities internally or through a third party, acceptance by physicians and patients of the benefits, safety and efficacy of our treatments.\nAny of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could result in significant delays or an inability to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for, or commercialize our product candidates, and we may ultimately be able to receive regulatory approval or generate revenue from the sale of TSC or any other product candidate.\nA number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage Phase 3 clinical development even after promising results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials. If later-stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results for TSC or any other product candidate, or we are unable to complete the necessary clinical trials for any reason (including a lack of funding), our ability to achieve regulatory approval or successfully commercialize may be compromised. At any time, we may decide or be forced by circumstance to delay or discontinue the development or commercialization of TSC or any of our other product candidates, including as a result of unfavorable results in later-stage clinical trials, changes in our internal product, technology or indication focus, the appearance of new technologies that make our product candidate obsolete, competition from a competing product, or changes in (or failure to comply with) applicable regulatory requirements. If we decide or are forced to terminate the TSC development program or any future program in which we have invested significant resources, we will not receive any return on our investment despite the allocation of significant resources, we may not be able to execute on our business plan effectively, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely effected.\nEven if we are able to successfully complete the clinical trials and over development activities necessary to submit an NDA to the FDA or an application for marketing approval to an equivalent non-U.S. regulatory authority, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for TSC, DFN-529, or any other product candidates we may attempt to develop in future, for the indications for which we initially seek approval or at all. The FDA and similar non-U.S. regulatory authorities have significant discretion in the approval process, including the ability to delay, limit, or deny approval of product candidates. The delay, limitation, or denial of regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, and TSC in particular, would limit or restrict altogether our ability to commercialize the product and generate revenue, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale, and we may never obtain regulatory approval to commercialize TSC, DFN-529, or any other product candidates we may attempt to develop in the future. The research, testing, manufacturing, safety surveillance, efficacy, quality control, recordkeeping, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, distribution, import, export, and reporting of safety and other post-market information related to drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and abroad, which often differ from country to country. We will not be permitted to market TSC or any of our other current product candidates in the U.S. until we receive approval of an NDA or other applicable regulatory filing from the FDA, and we will not be permitted to market TSC or any of our other current product candidates in any non-U.S. countries until we receive the requisite approval from the applicable regulatory authorities.\nTo gain approval to market a new drug, such as TSC, the FDA and similar non-U.S. regulatory authorities require the submission of an NDA (or similar application) that contains preclinical and clinical data adequately demonstrating the safety, purity, potency, efficacy, and compliant manufacturing of the product for the intended indication. The FDA and their non-U.S. counterparts have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit, or deny approval of applications for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndeemed issues with the design or execution of one or more clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndeemed deficiencies in the formulation, quality control, labeling, or specifications of the product candidate;\n\u2022\ndeemed issues in our manufacturing processes or in the controls or facilities of third-party manufacturers or testing labs with which we contract;\n\u2022\na determination that the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials included in the application is not sufficient to support approval, or do not meet a required level of statistical or clinical significance, including as a result of a differing interpretation of the data than that presented by the Company in our application;\n\u2022\na determination that the perceived risks of approving the product candidate outweigh the clinical and other benefits of approval;\n\u2022\na determination that additional preclinical studies or clinical trials are required, either prior to or as a contingency to approval, and, for certain target indications such as pediatric populations, in the targeted sub-population;\n\u2022\na determination that a product candidate may only be approved on a contingent basis or for a more limited indication or patient population than we request;\n\u2022\na determination that labeling we believe is necessary or desirable for successful commercialization cannot be approved; or\n\u2022\nunanticipated future changes to the approval process and related regulations.\nHistorically, of the large number of drugs in development at any given time, only a small percentage successfully complete the regulatory approval processes and are ultimately commercialized. Our product candidates may not be approved for sale and marketing by the FDA or any other governmental authority, even if they meet specified endpoints in our clinical trials. The FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies may ask us to conduct additional costly and time-consuming clinical trials in order to obtain marketing approval or approval to enter into a further phase of clinical development, or may change the requirements for approval even after such agency has reviewed and commented on the design for the clinical trials.\nAny delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, the regulatory approvals necessary to market and sell our product candidates would delay or prevent commercialization and would materially and adversely effect our business, financial condition, or result of operations. Furthermore, if we determine in the future that the development, approval, or commercial prospects of any product candidate are insufficient to justify our continued expenditure of the associated development and other costs, we may choose to delay, suspend, or abandon our development or commercialization efforts with respect thereto, which would reduce or eliminate our potential return on investment for those product candidates.\nOur ability to develop our product candidates depends, and, if TSC or any of our other product candidates are approved, our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend, in part on our ability to successfully obtain sufficient quantities of the necessary APIs, other component substances and materials, and finished drug product for our product candidates. We are currently entirely dependent on third parties for the manufacture and supply of our product candidates and their component parts, including, with respect to TSC, a sole supplier. We may be unable to continue to develop or commercialize our product candidates or face significant delays in that process if we are unable to successfully obtain these materials or manufacture drug product in sufficient quantities.\nMaintaining an adequate supply of TSC and our other product candidates to meet our needs is critical to the success of our business. However, manufacturing and supply of APIs, other substances and materials and finished drug products is a complex and technically challenging process, and changes beyond our direct control can impact the quality, volume, price, and successful delivery of our product candidates or impede, delay, limit or prevent the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. Mistakes and mishandling are not uncommon in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industry and can affect successful production and supply significantly.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have no internal manufacturing capabilities and therefore we do not have direct control over our ability to maintain drug supply sufficient to serve our needs for our ongoing and planned clinical trials or, if any of our product candidates are approved, commercialization. Although we are ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements such as cGMPs, we are dependent on our third party CMOs and other contract suppliers and manufacturers for the manufacture of our drug product, including both APIs and finished products, as well as day-to-day compliance with cGMPs and certain other manufacturing-related regulatory requirements. Facilities used by our contract suppliers and manufacturers to produce the APIs and other substances and materials or finished products for commercial sale must pass inspection, provide regulators with certain technical information, and be approved by the FDA and other relevant regulatory authorities to confirm compliance with cGMP requirements and other regulatory requirements. If the safety of TSC or any of our other product candidates (or any component thereof) is found in the future to be compromised, we may not be able to successfully commercialize or obtain regulatory approval for the product candidate, and we may be held liable for injuries sustained as a result.\nAny disruption in our relationship with these third parties or their ability to manufacture the APIs and finished drug product we need for our clinical trials and other development activities could result in significant delays in our anticipated development timelines and/or significant additional supply costs. Such a disruption could be the result of any number of reasons, including contractual disputes with our partners, regulatory issues at our partner or at their facilities (whether or not related to Diffusion or our drug product), financial issues faced by our partners (including bankruptcy or insolvency), damages to our partners facility or equipment, communication breakdowns, or acts of God. For example, we are currently facing certain delays in the manufacturing process for planned, new batches of TSC drug product due to the fact that, in connection with the U.S. federal government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed initiative in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the facility at which our primary CMO partner conducts significant portions of the TSC manufacturing process has been mandated to devote the majority of the facility\u2019s available resources to the manufacture of components of the COVID-19 vaccine. If our CMO is unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of drug supply to meet our needs in a timely fashion or in accordance with the specifications contracted for, we may be forced to delay our development plans for TSC, find alternative suppliers, or pursue other available remedies, which could result in additional costs and the diversion of management\u2019s time.\nAmplifying this risk is the fact that we currently depend upon a sole source for manufacture of API for TSC and other aspects of our manufacturing process, limiting our available options to troubleshoot these issues. Although we are currently in the process of identifying and developing alternative manufacturing and supply alternatives, this process remains ongoing, will take time, and will involve significant costs. Furthermore, due to the significant regulatory oversight of the pharmaceutical manufacturing process, any changes in the identity of our third-party partners or in our manufacturing processes - even if in the best interests of the Company and successful - could result in regulatory and other delays, as well as significant additional costs. In addition, if our current supplier terminated our arrangement or failed to meet our supply needs for any reason prior to the time we are able to identify sufficient alternative manufacturing capacity, we may be forced to delay our development plans significantly.\nOur CMO and other manufacturing and supply partners are also engaged to supply and manufacture materials or products for other biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, exposing them to regulatory risks unrelated to the work they are doing for Diffusion but which may nevertheless impact their ability to meet their contractual requirements to us or otherwise impede their ability to supply us with sufficient quantities of drug product. Failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may also affect the regulatory clearance of a contract supplier\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s facility. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency does not approve these facilities for the supply or manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws its approval in the future, even if such lack of approval is unrelated to Diffusion or our product candidates, we may need to find alternative supply or manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, to date we have only manufactured TSC and our other product candidates in relatively small quantities for preclinical studies and clinical trials. As we prepare for additional, later-stage clinical trials and potential commercialization, we will need to take steps to substantially increase the scale at which we are able to product TSC, its API, and its other component parts. In order to meet these needs, our CMOs and suppliers will need to be able to produce our API, other components, and finished product in larger quantities, more cost effectively and, in certain cases, at higher yields than they currently achieve. These third-party contractors may not be able to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of such drug substance and product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner or at all. Even if such a scale up is possible, it may require additional processes, technologies, and validation studies, which are costly, may not be successful, and which the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities would need to review and approve prior to any commercial sale of TSC or any other product candidate. In addition, quality issues may arise during those scale-up activities because of the inherent properties of a product candidate itself or in combination with other components added during the process of manufacturing, packaging, shipping, or storage.\nOur reliance on contract manufacturers and suppliers further exposes us to the possibility that they, or third parties with access to their facilities, will have access to and may misappropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary information. In addition, the manufacturing facilities of certain of our suppliers are located outside of the United States. This may give rise to difficulties in importing our products or product candidates or their components into the United States or other countries as a result of, among other things, regulatory agency approval requirements or import inspections, incomplete or inaccurate import documentation or defective packaging.\nAny of these factors could cause a delay or termination of preclinical studies, clinical trials, other development activities, regulatory submissions or approvals of our product candidates, or, if approved, commercial supply, and could result in significant, unanticipated costs or an ability to effectively develop our products candidates or commercialize our approved products on a timely basis, or at all, which could materially and adversely effect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe expect to rely on third-party CROs and other third parties to conduct and oversee our clinical trials and other aspects of our development process for TSC and our other product candidates. If these third parties do not meet our requirements or otherwise conduct the trials or perform the other services for which they are engaged, we may not be able to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all. Furthermore, if we are not able to establish and maintain the necessary collaborative relationships with our CROs and other third party partners, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nConducting our clinical trials in a safe, compliant, and timely manner is critical to our success. We currently rely on third-party CROs to conduct and oversee our clinical trials and other aspects of our product development, as well as various medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories, consultants, and other third parties to design and conduct our trials, to analyze the results therefrom, and to ensure that the trials are conducted in accordance with our clinical protocols and all applicable regulatory requirements, including the FDA\u2019s regulations and GCPs. These CROs and other third parties play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data therefrom, as we control only certain aspects of their activities and rely heavily on them to execute our trials in a safe, compliant, and timely manner. Although we intend to internalize portions of some of these functions during 2021 and beyond as our organization grows, we expect to continue to rely on these third parties to a significant degree in the future.\nIf any of our CROs, clinical trial sites, or other third party partners terminates their involvement in one of our clinical trials (or with Diffusion entirely) for any reason, we may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements sufficient to meet our needs, on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, if our relationship with clinical trial sites is terminated, we may incur significant additional costs or experience the loss of follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials, unless we are able to transfer the care of those patients to another qualified clinical trial site.\nWe, as well as the CROs and other third-party contractors acting on our behalf, are required to comply with GCP and GLP requirements in all of our clinical trials, which are enforced through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP, GLP, or other regulatory requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials to supplement or replace such data before receiving approval of a product candidate from the FDA or a non-U.S. regulatory authority. Our clinical trials must also generally be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our and our partners\u2019 compliance with these various regulations may be reviewed by regulatory inspections at any time, processes over which we will have very little control or immediate visibility, and a failure to comply with these regulations and policies by us, our CROs, or any of our other third party partners may result in significant delays in our development programs. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and could receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned by the FDA.\nIn addition, in order to fund or otherwise further development of our current or future product candidates, we may collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies on their development and potential commercialization of those product candidates. We would face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners and whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend on many factors, including, our assessment of the partner\u2019s resources and experience, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; the potential market for the subject product candidate; uncertainty with respect to our ownership of our intellectual property; and industry and market conditions generally. These types of collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document and could ultimately result in lower returns on investment for our stockholders than would have been achieved developing the product candidate without a partner. Further, if we were to breach our obligations under the agreements governing any such future collaboration, we may face substantial consequences, including potential termination of the collaboration, and our rights to our partners\u2019 product candidates, in which we have invested substantial time and money, would be lost.\nAny failure to successfully enter into and maintain the necessary relationships with CROs and our other current and future third party partners and collaborators could materially and adversely effect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nGeneral Risks Related to the Development, Regulatory Approval, and Commercialization of TSC and Our Other Product Candidates\nOur business, financial condition, or results of operations may also be materially adversely effected by a number of general risks related to the development and regulatory approval of our product candidates that are not specific to our Company, including:\n\u2022 Our TSC COVID Trial, which we completed in February 2021, was conducted at the NIID in Bucharest, Romania and we may in the future conduct additional clinical trials for TSC or our other product candidates outside the U.S. In connection with an application for marketing approval, the FDA may determine not to accept data from clinical trials conducted outside of the U.S. if they determine the data presented therefrom cannot be considered valid without further inspection of the clinical trial site, are not applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, or as a result of certain other factors. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept any data we obtain from the TSC COVID Trial or other trials we may conduct outside the U.S. in the future.\n\u2022 We face a number of risks related to the potential for one or more of our product candidates to cause undesirable side effects, have other unexpected properties, contain manufacturing defects, or be subject to misuse or abuse. The occurrence of one or more of these events with respect to a product candidate or product could delay or prevent its regulatory approval, limit its commercial potential, result in additional pre- or post-approval regulatory requirements, or subject us to product liability exposure to consumers, health care providers, or others. Product liability claims could be brought in the future even if a product is approved for commercial sale and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the appropriate governmental authorities, and if product liability claims brought against us in the future were to be successful, we could incur substantial liability if our insurance coverage for those claims proved to be inadequate.\n\u2022 Our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, CROs, and other third parties we work with in the course of our development activities may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, during the course of their employment or other engagement with us. Any such misconduct or improper activities, whether intentional or negligent, could result in regulatory sanctions or other penalties against the Company, exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, the incurrence of substantial defense costs, and serious harm to our reputation.\nIn addition, although we currently have no marketed products, in the event TSC or any of our other product candidates are approved for marketing and commercial sale by the FDA or any other regulatory authority, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially adversely effected by a number of general risks related to the commercialization of such products that are not specific to our Company, including:\n\u2022 Even if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may fail to achieve the broad degree of physician and patient adoption and use necessary for commercial success. The degree and rate of physician and patient adoption will depend on a number of factors, including the clinical indications for which a product candidate is approved and its effectiveness compared to other therapies, cost and the availability of reimbursement and other coverage from third party payors, our ability to educate patients and healthcare providers regarding a new therapy, and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. Furthermore, we will face significant competition, often from products sold and marketed by companies with far greater resources than Diffusion, and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration.\n\u2022 With respect to any such future products available only by prescription, if we are unable to achieve and maintain coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors - including governmental health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and private insurance companies - and access to such third party payors\u2019 drug formularies, the commercial success of those products may be severely hindered. If any such products do not demonstrate attractive efficacy profiles, they may not qualify for coverage and reimbursement and, even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate, may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high, and may vary from payor to payor, and there is no assurance that coverage and reimbursement levels necessary to achieve commercial success will be obtained..\n\u2022 Any such future products candidates that we commercialize will be subject to ongoing and continued regulatory review, including rules and regulations of the FDA and similar non-U.S. governmental authorities relating to advertising, marketing and labeling (including restrictions on the promotion of off-label use), potential REMS requirements, routine manufacturing and other review, and required compliance with GLP. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with any such product, or any facility at or process by which it is manufactured, we may face restrictions on the sale or distribution of such product or on our Company as a whole, including regulatory actions requiring us to modify marketing or sales materials, suspend manufacturing or ongoing trials, initiate a recall or withdrawal the product from the market entirely, enter into a consent decree, or submit to other civil or criminal investigations and penalties. If we are not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u2022 The biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries are highly regulated and the potential for future legislative reform provides uncertainty and potential threats to our business and our potential future revenue and profitability of any such future products. In the U.S., there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and medical services including those described in Part I - Item 1. Business - Certain Other Legislation and Regulations - Current Healthcare Laws and Regulations of this Annual Report. Additional state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, whether in the U.S. or other market territories we may pursue.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nSince the founding of Diffusion LLC in 2001, we have been principally focused on the development of TSC for the treatment of hypoxia and as a platform to enhance standard-of-care treatment for conditions complicated by hypoxia. Many of our issued patents were issued early in our Company\u2019s history. While we are regularly engaged in further research and development activities with respect to TSC and our other product candidates that may result in novel developments and findings that ultimately lead to further intellectual property opportunities, if the terms of any of our key patents expire before or soon after our therapeutic candidates are approved, or if manufacturers of biosimilar drugs successfully challenge our patents, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially adversely effected.\nPatents have a limited duration. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest non-provisional filing date in the U.S. Various extensions may be available, including under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments as described elsewhere in this Annual Report, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering TSC and our product candidates, including with respect to their manufacture or use, are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to additional competition from competitive medications, including biosimilar medications. In the case of Diffusion, the normal lives (in other words, prior to the application of any patent term restoration of marketing exclusivity periods that may be available) of our issued U.S. patents related to TSC begin to expire in 2023, which may be prior to the time that we are able to obtain regulatory approval for and, if approved, commercialize TSC.\nEven if patent term extension or other protections such as marketing exclusivity are available upon the regulatory approval (if any) of TSC or any of our other product candidates, the benefits provided by these regulatory and legislative mechanisms is limited and typically less robust than full patent protection. For example, the five-year extension of patent life potentially available under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Receiving such an extension is also subject to compliance with applicable deadlines for application and certain other regulatory requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner than we expect. Also, the scope of our right to exclude during any patent term extension period may be limited or may not cover a competitor\u2019s product or product use.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting any drug candidate might expire before or shortly after such drug candidate is approved or commercialized. Similarly, our patents and patent applications may not provide us with sufficient time or rights to commercialize our product candidates or exclude others from commercializing products similar ours. If our patent protections for our product candidates have expired, this could include manufacturers of identical, biosimilar drugs.\nIf we are unable to obtain new, patent claims with respect to our existing product candidates and other technologies, in particular those related to our lead product candidate TSC, that both adequately protect our intellectual property position for commercial purposes and extend the term of overall protection as compared to our existing issued patents, we may be reliant on these types of patent term extensions and similar exceptions for such protection during the ultimate commercialization of TSC. This limited protection could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to obtain or enforce patent rights or other intellectual property rights that cover our product candidates and technologies that are of sufficient breadth to prevent third parties from competing against us.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on developing proprietary therapeutics. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, patenting, manufacturing, and marketing of health care products competitive with those that we are developing, and we face competition from a number of sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, biotechnology companies and academic and research institutions. Accordingly, our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in both the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions will be critical to ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and, in particular, commercialize TSC and our other product candidates. These protections are and will be essential to preserving and protecting our novel inventions, proprietary developments, and trade secrets and to preventing third parties from infringing upon them. In particular, our ability to protect any of our product candidates from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends in substantial part on our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents in the U.S. and worldwide.\nOur patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications in the U.S. and other major markets covering our technology with varying scope, including issued U.S. patents related to composition of matter, formulation, methods of delivery, and methods of use and the scope of coverage vary from country to country. Although we believe that our intellectual property position is strong and are currently assessing our operations and existing portfolio for additional intellectual property opportunities, we do not have - and may be unable to obtain - patent protection for every aspect of our technology. For aspects of our technology for which we do not have patent coverage, or in countries where we do not have granted patents, we may not have any ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our technologies or technologies substantially similar to ours, and any patents that we may obtain in the future may be narrow in scope and thus easily circumvented by competitors. Further, in countries where we do not have granted patents, third parties may be able to make, use or sell products identical to or substantially similar to, our product candidates.\nDue to legal standards relating to patentability, validity, enforceability and claim scope of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions, our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. The patent application process, also known as patent prosecution, is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prepare, file, and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, these and any of our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in an optimal manner. It is also possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to inadvertent prior public disclosures, proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope, or patent term adjustments. If our current or future third party development partners are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance, or enforcement of any patent rights, those patent rights could be compromised and we might not be able to prevent third parties from making, using and selling competing products. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that any patents will issue from any of our currently pending patent applications, which could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties.\nEven for aspects of our technology for which we have obtained, or obtain in the future, patent protection, the complexity of legal and factual questions underlying such claims means they may not provide us with sufficient protection for our product candidates to afford a commercial advantage against competitive products or processes, including those from branded and generic pharmaceutical companies. We cannot guarantee that the claims of these patents are or will be held valid or enforceable by the courts or will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable to us. Third parties may design around or challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of such issued patents or any other issued patents we own or license, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents we hold or pursue with respect to our product candidates is challenged, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, or threaten our ability to commercialize, our product candidates. Changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.\nIn addition, patents have a limited lifespan, presenting further challenges in effectively protecting our technologies and associated commercial position. In the U.S., the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available under a variety of legislative and regulatory avenues but often the life afforded by these extensions and the protections they afford are often limited relative to full patent protection. The extensive period of time between patent filing and regulatory approval for a product candidate limits the time during which we can market a product candidate under patent protection, which may particularly affect the profitability of our early-stage product candidates. In particular, we have been developing TSC since the founding of Diffusion LLC in the early 2000s and, as a result, portions of our patent portfolio, including certain patents related to TSC\u2019s composition of matter, will expire beginning in 2023. If the other issued patents in our portfolio currently or that may issue in the future are not adequate to protect our technologies, our competitive position may be harmed and we may face generic or other competition sooner than we otherwise would.\nFurthermore, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not provide intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally in those countries. If we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed.\nProprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how are also very important to our business. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and intellectual property protection agreements with certain employees, consultants and advisors, third parties may still obtain this information or we may be unable to protect our rights. We also have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our suppliers, manufacturers and other third parties. There can be no assurance that binding agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets and unpatented know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. If trade secrets are independently discovered, we would not be able to prevent their use. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or unpatented know-how is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the U.S. may be less willing to protect trade secret information.\nIf we are unable to adequately obtain or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights for any reason, it could materially and adversely effect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. For more information about our intellectual property and our competition, see the information included in Part I - Item 1. Business - Products, Product Development, and Our Competition of this Annual Report.\nIf we become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, or if we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur ultimate commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market, and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies in the U.S. and non-U.S. markets. In order to do so, it is critical that we prevent third parties from infringing on our intellectual property rights and that we operate our business without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others.\nHowever, numerous U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in fields relating to TSC and our other product candidates, their potential methods of delivery, potential indications they may be used to treat, and their other features, and, as more patents are issued over time, the risk increases that others may assert that our product candidates, technologies, or methods of delivery or use infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights, or that we discover a third party infringing on our rights. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various drugs, biologics, drug delivery systems, or their methods of use, which of these patents may be valid and enforceable, and what inventions or technologies may be claimed by non-public patent applications. Patent applications in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after their first non-provisional filing and publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, meaning we cannot be certain whether others, including our competitors, have filed patent applications for technology covered by patents or our pending applications and whether any such filing has priority over our own applications or patents.\nIn the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries in particular, there is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. This type of litigation may occur unexpectedly but may also be prompted by specific events, such as a patent application being made public by the USPTO or a non-U.S. governmental authority or under Paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. For more information regarding the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and Paragraph IV thereunder, see the information in Part I - Item 1. Business - Government Regulation - The Hatch-Waxman Amendments of this Annual Report.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, no litigation asserting infringement claims has been brought against us, nor have we filed such a claim against any third party. However, we cannot assure you that the development or future commercialization of any of our product candidates or other technologies will not result in claims that our activities infringe on the existing or future intellectual property rights of third parties. Furthermore, potential competitors may infringe our intellectual property, including our patents. For example, in the first quarter of 2021, we became aware of a third party affiliated with a former outside consultant of the Company which claims to be in early-stage development of a product candidate that purportedly may operate through a similar mechanism of action to TSC.\nWe may be required to file infringement claims to stop third-party infringement or unauthorized use or, if a third party claims we are infringing on their rights, respond to such claims. This process can be expensive and time consuming, and could result in a court deciding that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, that a third party is not required to stop using a technology we believe infringe on our rights, significant costs, or the diversion of management\u2019s time. An adverse determination in any litigation or other proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, interpreted narrowly, or amended such that they do not cover our product candidates in a manner sufficient to support our development and commercialization needs or that such product candidate needs to be significantly redesigned, or put our pending patent applications at risk of not issuing, or issuing with limited and potentially inadequate scope. Further, some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources.\nIn addition, interference, derivation, or other proceedings brought at the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority or patentability of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. Litigation or USPTO proceedings brought by us may fail or may be invoked against us by third parties. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, domestic or foreign litigation or USPTO or foreign patent office proceedings may result in substantial costs and the diversion of management\u2019s time. We may not be able to prevent all misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries with a legal framework that offers limited intellectual property protections or where the costs of enforcement outweigh the commercial and other benefits of maintaining intellectual property protections.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation or other proceedings, including as a result of public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, or public access to related documents. This type of disclosure could put us at a significant competitive disadvantage by disclosing important trade secrets or other proprietary information to our competitors and other third parties.\nAny litigation or other challenge related to our intellectual property could materially and adversely effect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nGeneral Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur business, financial condition, or results of operations may also be materially adversely effected by a number of general risks related to our intellectual property that are not specific to our Company, including:\n\u2022 As is common in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries, some of our employees were formerly employed by companies in the industry, including our competitors or potential competitors, and some of our consultants actively work for other companies in the industry. As a result, although we have in place policies which prohibit the use of third-party confidential information in violation of any obligation to a former employer or otherwise, we may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their former employers or their former or current customers. In addition, if any of our current employees or consultants are engaged by a competitor in the future, it is possible that they may appropriate or otherwise improperly use our proprietary and confidential information. Any of the foregoing events could result in significant costs and the diversion of time and resources.\n\u2022 Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated as a result of any non-compliance with these requirements. We may also abandon certain intellectual property protections that we would otherwise maintain if we determine such protections are not expected to provide sufficient value relative to the cost of ongoing maintenance.\n\u2022 Patent laws and other intellectual property protections available in the U.S., E.U., or other jurisdictions are subject to change. These changes may be unpredictable, weaken our overall intellectual property position, increase our costs related to maintenance and enforcement, or otherwise diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates and maximize our return on investment thereon.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Financial Position, Results of Operation, and Organizational Structure\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operations which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may be forced to delay or curtail our clinical trials and other development activities or be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates due to a lack of sufficient resources.\nAlthough we expect that our existing cash resources will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements, including expected costs related to the planned TSC Oxygenation Trials and our Planned Phase 2 Hypoxia-related Indication Trial, through 2023, we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts as we continue to develop TSC and our other product candidates, we will need to obtain additional financing in the future in order to complete the development of TSC and fund our other development and operational activities.\nWe cannot be certain that the additional funding we will require will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Investors may demand significant discounts to market prices or that we agree to restrictive covenants or other limitations on our ability to operate our business, and conditions in the capital markets may make equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain or negatively impact our ability to complete a financing transaction at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly delay, scale back, discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, or seek alternative financing opportunities such as collaborations or licensing opportunities. For example, prior to completing the May 2020 Offering and February 2021 Offering, we determined that we did not have adequate resources to fully support the randomized portion of the TSC GBM Trial and commencement of enrollment in the trial was suspended following the run-in portion.\nFurthermore, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves the associated risks and uncertainties. Although we have based this estimate on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, they may prove to be wrong, we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, and actual results could vary greatly from our expectations expressed in this Annual Report as a result. The magnitude and timing of our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe number, development stage, and other characteristics of product candidates that we choose to develop, including any product candidates that we may in-license or otherwise acquire in the future;\n\u2022\nthe clinical development plans we establish for these product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe magnitude of costs associated with filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, progress, timing, costs, and results of clinical trials for such product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of completion of becoming a commercial organization; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments.\nWe currently generate no revenue from the sale of products, have incurred significant losses since our inception, have a history of net losses and negative cash flow from operations, expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and may never become profitable. In addition, our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations. As a result, any investment in our common stock is speculative and risky.\nWe are a clinical stage biotechnology company and, as a result, we have a limited operating history from which to assess how we will respond to competitive, economic, or other challenges to our business, and our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by similarly situated companies.\nWe have limited cash resources, have generated substantial net losses and negative cash flow from operations since our inception, and we continue to incur significant research, development, and other expenses related to our ongoing operations, including the development of TSC and our other product candidates. To date, we have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates and, accordingly, have not generated any revenues from the sale of products. We expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, our future operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including the delays in our product development programs including as a result of regulatory review, increased expenditures related to manufacturing or the enforcement of intellectual property rights, other litigation costs, changes in accounting policies, or other unanticipated events.\nOur ability to generate sufficient revenues from TSC or any of our other product candidates, if approved, will depend on numerous factors described throughout this Annual Report. Even if we are able to successfully develop and receive regulatory approval for TSC or any of our other product candidates, we do not know if or when any such product will achieve commercial success or generate revenue for us, and we will incur significant costs associated with the commercialization that will need to be offset by revenue before achieving a profit. We may also in the future enter into collaboration agreements and license agreements with other companies that include milestone expenditures and payments, in which case our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability may be dependent on the achievement of those milestones. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods, and our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity. Furthermore, due to the uncertainty of the drug development process, we are often unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability, if at all.\nWe will need to further increase the size and complexity of our organization in the future including, if TSC or any of our other product candidates are approved for commercial sale, establishing sales and marketing capabilities. We may experience difficulties in executing our growth strategy or managing any growth that we do experience if we are unable to recruit and retain talented individuals in key positions.\nOur ability to succeed in the highly competitive pharmaceuticals industry depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have 13 full-time employees and one part-time employee, including our new Senior Director of Quality Assurance hired during the first quarter of 2021. Particularly given our near-term plans for the TSC development program and our compliance requirements with the FDA, SEC, and other regulatory bodies, we believe that our current staffing levels are inadequate to support our future needs. We anticipate adding additional personnel to our team throughout the organization during 2021 in an effort to support the development of TSC, grow our business more generally, and optimize the size of our organization. In addition, assuming success in our planned clinical trials, we expect to further supplement and grow our scientific, clinical, regulatory, financial, and other human resources to support our planned research, development, and commercialization plans for TSC and our other product candidates..\nOur ability to effectively manage our anticipated growth will depend on multiple factors, including, among others, our ability to:\n\u2022 effectively retain current talent and effectively recruit sufficient numbers of new talented employees;\n\u2022 manage our third-party supply and manufacturing operations effectively and in a cost-effective manner,\n\u2022 while increasing production capabilities for our current product candidates to commercial levels;\n\u2022 establish and maintain relationships with development and commercialization partners\n\u2022 manage our development and commercialization efforts effectively and in a cost-effective manner; and\n\u2022 continue to improve our operational, clinical, financial, management and regulatory compliance controls and reporting systems and procedures;\nWe are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel, including our executive officers, certain other key employees and consultants, and the members of our Board. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could impede, delay, or prevent completion of our planned clinical trials, regulatory approval, or commercialization of TSC or any of our other product candidates. If we lose the services of any of these individuals, we might not be able to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or at all, and our business could be harmed as a result. All of our employees, including our executive officers with whom we have employment agreements, are employed on an at-will basis and their employment can be terminated by us or them at any time. As part of our efforts to retain our valuable employees, we, among other things, provide a generous salary and benefits package, as described in more detail in Part I - Item 1. Business - Our People and Human Capital Resources of this Annual Report\nNevertheless, we may be unable to attract or retain qualified management and other key personnel in the future due to the intense competition among biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and other businesses. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify or employ qualified personnel for any such position on acceptable terms, if at all, and the high levels of competition within the industry may mean that we will be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies with whom we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and longer histories in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will harm our ability to implement our business strategy and achieve our business objectives. Furthermore, as we currently have no marketed products, we currently have no sales or marketing personnel or capabilities. To commercialize TSC or any of our other product candidates, if approved, in the we will need to build our marketing, sales, distribution, and other related capabilities or arrange with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so.\nIn addition, we have historically utilized the services of certain outside independent contractors to perform a number of critical functions for our company, including with respect to clinical development, regulatory matters, accounting, and human resources, a practice we expect to continue and may choose to expand in the future. We rely on these independent contractors and effectively managing our relationships with them is and will remain a priority. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage these relationships effectively, that such contractors will be able or choose to continue working with us in the future, or that we will be able to find additional or replacement services if and as needed, on economically reasonable terms or at all.\nIf we are not able to effectively manage our growth and expand our organization through a combination of effectively retaining our existing employees and third-party contractors and successfully recruiting new employees and contractors, we may be unable to effectively execute on our product development and other strategic plans, which my adversely effect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIf we decide to in-license or acquire one or more additional product candidates or otherwise enter into a strategic transaction, it could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses, and present significant distractions to our management team.\nWe currently only have two product candidates under active development, our lead product candidate, TSC, and our second product candidates, DFN-529. We may in the future implement a strategy to in-license or acquire one or more additional product candidates to supplement our pipeline. We may also consider a variety of other strategic transactions, including spin-offs, partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations, and minority investments. Any such transaction would expose us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the potential incurrence of recurring, non-recurring (including unknown liabilities), or other charges (including amortization expenses, write-downs, or other impairment charges), increase of short- and long-term expenditures, or dilution our stockholders, as well as posing significant integration, implementation, or retention challenges and diverting our management team\u2019s focus on other priorities, including the TSC development program. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation. which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. There can be no assurance that we will undertake such a transaction or, if we do, that we will successfully complete the transaction or that the transaction will be additive to our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may be limited as a result of past and future issuances of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $11.7 million in federal and state NOL carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, if any, for income tax purposes. If not utilized, the NOL carryforwards will begin expiring during the year ending December 31, 2034. Under Section 382 of the Tax Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50.0% change, measured by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-ownership change NOL carryforwards and other pre-ownership change tax attributes - such as research tax credits - to offset its post-ownership change income may be limited. In the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the issuance of a significant number of shares our common stock pursuant to the May 2019 Offering, November 2019 Offering, and December 2019 Offering, we performed an analysis under Section 382 of the Tax Code and, as a result of such analysis and a determination that such an ownership change had taken place, we reduced our NOL carryforwards. In the event we issue additional shares of common stock to fund our future development efforts and those issuances result in additional ownership changes for purposes of Section 382 of the Tax Code, as we did in the May 2020 Offering and the February 2021 Offering, our NOL carryforwards could be further reduced.\nGeneral Risks Related to Our Business, Financial Condition, Results of Operations, and Organizational Structure\nOur business, financial condition, or results of operations may also be materially adversely affected by a number of general risks related thereto and to our organizational structure that are not specific to our Company, including:\n\u2022 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. Furthermore, our disclosure controls and procedures are subject to inherent limitations, human error, and other systematic breakdowns, and therefore may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\u2022 As our Company, the industry in which we operate, and the world-at-large become increasingly virtual, our acquisition and implementation of additional information technology solutions and our compliance with global privacy and data security requirements could result in additional costs and liabilities or inhibit our ability to collect and process data globally. Furthermore, any failure to comply with applicable requirements or best practices - as well as other events outside of our control - could result in a security breach or other disruption to our information technology systems, limit our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations, compromise our or third parties\u2019 confidential information, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\u2022 We incur significant costs as a result of our public company status and devote substantial management time to operating as a public company, including complying with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, SOX, and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. If, in the future, we are required to include in our annual report an attestation of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting, the amount of these compliance costs would increase significantly.\n\u2022 Although we have in place business continuity and disaster recovery plans, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be negatively affected by volatility, disruptions, or other uncertainty caused by market fluctuations, economic downturns or unfavorable global economic conditions, pandemics, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, events of war, terrorism, or other man-made problems, or other geopolitical events outside of our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit.\n\u2022 If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including the healthcare laws and regulations described in Part I - Item 1. Business - Certain Other Legislation and Regulations - Current Healthcare Laws and Regulations of this Annual Report and applicable environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines, penalties, or other consequences.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile and any investment in our securities may suffer a decline in value. In addition, this volatility may subject our business to additional risks, such as an increased risk of securities litigation or inability to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the closing market price for our common stock varied between a high of $1.50 on July 21, 2020 and a low of $0.26 on March 16, 2020. As a result of fluctuations in the price of our common stock, you may be unable to sell shares or our common stock at or above the price you paid for them, even if your holding period is relatively short. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market, industry and other factors, including the degree of analyst coverage of our stock, their valuations and recommendations, and whether any such analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business. If the results of our business do not meet these analysts\u2019 forecasts, the expectations of investors or the financial guidance we provide to investors in any period, the market price of our common stock could decline. Furthermore, despite this volatility, due to the fact that we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, we expect that only appreciation of the price of our common stock, if any, will provide a return to our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nHistorically, the stock markets in general, and the markets for biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced significant volatility that has at times been unrelated to the business, financial condition, or results of operations of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, consequently, adversely affect the price at which you are able to sell any shares of our common stock that you own. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market or significant price declines in individual securities or the market as a whole, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn addition, our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. To maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, maintaining a minimum closing bid price for our common stock. Particularly given the historical volatility experienced by our common stock, there is no assurance that we will continue to meet the minimum closing price requirement and other listing requirements of Nasdaq.\nWe have funded our operations to date through the issuance of securities, including common stock, warrants to purchase common stock, convertible preferred stock, and convertible debt securities, and we expect that in the future we will need to raise additional capital through similar means to fund our continued development efforts for TSC and our other liquidity needs. Assuming funding is available on acceptable terms, any future issuance of common stock or securities convertible for or exchangeable into common stock will result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could depress the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the terms of future financing transaction may contain provisions that restrict our operations or require us to relinquish certain rights to our product candidates or other technologies.\nAlthough we believe we have sufficient cash resources to fund the TSC Oxygenation Trials, our Planned Phase 2 Hypoxia-related Indication Trial, and our other operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2023, we will in the future need to raise additional funds to continue our operations, fund additional clinical trials evaluating TSC and our other product candidates, and, if approved, commercializing TSC. We plan to continue to finance our operations with a combination of equity issuances, debt arrangements, and, potentially, licensing, or other partnering relationships. In addition, our Board may determine at any time to raise additional capital if it believes the terms are in the best interests of our stockholders.\nAccordingly, new issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could occur at any time. For example, in February 2021, we issued 33,658,538 shares of our common stock in connection with the completion of the February 2021 Offering. Any issuance or sale of shares, or the perception in the market of an intent to issue or sell shares in the near-term, by the Company or holders of a large number of shares could reduce the market price of our common stock. We also cannot assure you that any such sale of common stock or other securities will be at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by you for our common stock. Furthermore, a depressed stock price could limit our ability to raise necessary capital through the sale of additional equity securities on terms that are acceptable.\nWe may also seek additional capital through other methods, either alone or in combination with the issuance of additional securities, including debt financings, receivables or royalty financings, strategic partnerships and alliances, and licensing arrangements, any of which could be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase stock. The incurrence of indebtedness could result in increased fixed payment obligations, liens and other security interests being placed on certain of our assets, and certain restrictive covenants being imposed on the operation of our business, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or acquire intellectual property rights. We may also in the future raise additional funds through strategic partnerships, alliances, and licensing arrangements with third parties, any of which could require us to relinquish valuable rights to TSC or our other product candidates. The restrictions imposed by any of these arrangement could materially decrease any potential returns on our investment in TSC or our other product candidates, or otherwise materially and adversely effect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur organizational documents impose certain anti-takeover provisions and make the Delaware Chancery Court the exclusive forum for certain stockholder actions, which could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, and our Bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company, a proxy contest, or the nomination of a director candidate by a stockholder more difficult than such actions would be in the absence of such provisions, including that:\n\u2022\nonly our Board has the right to fill a vacancy on the Board created by an expansion or by the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u2022\nonly our Chairman of the Board, our Chief Executive Officer, or a majority of our directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nwe may issue undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval (notwithstanding any requirements imposed by the SEC or any exchange on which our common stock may now or in the future trade), and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nour Board is expressly authorized to amend, restate, or repeal our Bylaws; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice is required with respect to any nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at any meeting of stockholder s.\nIn addition our Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions, including derivative actions brought on the Company's behalf, stockholder actions claiming breaches of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers, and claims arising under our organizational documents, in each case, subject to said Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Although this provision would not apply to any stockholder claims under the Exchange Act, there is uncertainty regarding whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written would apply to stockholder claims under the Securities Act. Nevertheless, this forum selection provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents, which may discourage lawsuits against us and such persons.\nThe limitations on certain stockholder rights imposed by these provisions could also depress the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 86536, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "DFFN"}
