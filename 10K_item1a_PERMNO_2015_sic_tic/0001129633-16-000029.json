{"cik": "1129633", "company": "PHOENIX COMPANIES INC/DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Merger\nAs described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 30, 2015, we have entered into a merger agreement (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), which, subject to various closing conditions, would result in our being acquired by Nassau Reinsurance Group Holdings L.P. (\u201cNassau\u201d). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Davero Merger Sub Corp., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Nassau, will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Nassau (the \u201cMerger\u201d). There are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the Merger.\nThe Merger may not be completed in the timeframe or manner currently anticipated, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nAlthough the Company has received approval of the Merger from our shareholders, the Merger remains subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of approvals from Connecticut and New York insurance regulators and the termination or expiration of applicable waiting periods under the rules and regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, among other closing conditions. It is possible that a government entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the completion of the Merger. If any condition to the closing of the Merger is neither satisfied nor waived, the Merger may not be completed. In addition, satisfying the conditions to the closing of the Merger may take longer than we currently expect. There can be no assurance that any of the remaining conditions to closing will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene, delay or result in a failure to complete the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, or it is not completed in the anticipated timeframe, we will be subject to several additional risks that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price, including:\n\u2022\nthe price of our common stock may decline, to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed for the merger consideration;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence may decline;\n\u2022\nwe would not realize any of the anticipated benefits of having completed the Merger; and\n\u2022\nwe may be required under certain circumstances to pay a termination fee to Nassau of $10.3 million, or reimburse Nassau for out-of-pocket expenses of up to $2 million (provided that, if the expense reimbursement is made, it will reduce any subsequent termination fee if that were also to become payable).\nIn the event that Nassau fails to complete the Merger as and when required by the Merger Agreement, or for any or no reason Nassau breaches the terms of the Merger Agreement by failing to perform any of its covenants under the Merger Agreement or otherwise, whether intentionally or unintentionally, the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement, if Nassau has not otherwise done so, and may seek monetary damages against Nassau in an amount not to exceed an aggregate of $20 million. If the actual damages incurred by us materially exceed this amount, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation may be negatively affected.\nShareholders will receive $37.50 in cash per share of our common stock despite changes in the market value of our common stock.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, the amount of the per share of merger consideration to be paid in cash is fixed and will not be increased for changes in our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operation or in the event of any change in the market price of, analyst estimates of, or projections relating to, our common stock. Therefore, the market value of our common stock may vary significantly from the value on the date the Merger Agreement was executed or at other later dates.\nThe pendency of the Merger, the related diversion of management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and other expenses incurred in connection with the Merger may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur management and board of directors have devoted and will continue to devote a significant amount of time, attention and resources in an effort to complete the Merger. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur various expenses to complete the Merger, which may be payable even if the Merger is not completed, and which could prove to be significant. As a result, our business and operating and financial results may be materially and adversely affected by the diversion of management\u2019s time, attention and resources and the considerable expenses incurred in connection with efforts towards completing the Merger.\nThe announcement of the Merger could disrupt our relationships with our employees, customers, suppliers and others, as well as disrupt our operating results and business generally.\nIn connection with the Merger, current and prospective employees of the Company may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which may materially and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. Similarly, it is possible that some customers, distributors, suppliers and other persons with whom we have business relationships may experience uncertainty about our future and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with other parties, or decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with us, any of which could negatively impact our revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. Further, any delay in closing or failure to complete the Merger could exacerbate any negative impact on our relationships with such persons or negatively impact our ability to implement alternative business plans with such persons.\nFurther, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain actions without Nassau\u2019s consent while the Merger is pending. These restrictions may, among other matters, prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, making certain investments or acquisitions, selling assets, engaging in capital expenditures in excess of certain agreed limits, incurring certain indebtedness or making certain other changes to our business pending the closing of the Merger. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Merger Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to seek other strategic alternatives.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, the Company has agreed not to solicit acquisition proposals or, subject to certain exceptions, to enter into any negotiations in connection with alternative transactions. In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, our board of directors may not, subject to certain exceptions, withdraw or change its recommendation in favor of approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement. In addition, we may be required to pay Nassau a termination fee of $10.3 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances. These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of the Company from proposing any such acquisition and the required payment of the termination fee could further affect the structure, pricing and terms proposed by a potential third-party acquirer and could deter such third party from making a competing transaction proposal even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher cash or market value than the value proposed to be received or realized in the Merger.\nIf the Merger is not completed and we are not otherwise acquired, we may then consider other strategic alternatives, which may subject us to additional risks and uncertainties.\nIf for any reason the Merger is not completed, our management and board of directors may review and consider the various alternatives available to us, including, among others, continuing as a public company with no material changes to our business or capital structure or merging with, or being acquired by, another public or private company. These alternative transactions or initiatives may involve various risks to our business, including, among others, distraction of our management team, as described above, and the incurrence of additional expenses in connection with considering alternatives. In addition, our ability to consummate any alternative transaction or execute any alternative initiative could be subject to several uncertainties. All of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nA lawsuit has been filed against the Company challenging the Merger, and an adverse ruling may prevent the Merger from being completed.\nThe Company and members of its board of directors have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit, in which the named plaintiff is a purported shareholder of the Company, challenging the board of directors\u2019 actions in connection with the Merger Agreement and seeking, among other things, monetary damages and injunctive relief to enjoin the defendants from completing the Merger on the agreed-upon terms. One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that no law, statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) shall have been enacted, entered into, promulgated or enforced by any supranational, federal, state or local court or other governmental entity which in effect makes illegal, prohibits, restrains or otherwise enjoins the completion of the Merger. Consequently, if the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting our ability to complete the Merger, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all.\nThe parties to the litigation have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) providing for the settlement of the litigation, subject to certain confirmatory discovery by the plaintiffs in the litigation and subject to the approval of the Superior Court of the State of Connecticut (the \u201cSuperior Court\u201d), among other things. The parties to the MOU will seek to enter into a stipulation of settlement, which will provide for, among other things, the conditional certification of the litigation as a non opt-out class action and the release of any and all claims arising from the Merger, subject to approval by the Superior Court. There can be no assurance that the settling parties will ultimately enter into a stipulation of settlement or that the Superior Court will approve the settlement even if the settling parties were to enter into the stipulation. In such event, or if the Merger is not consummated for any reason, the proposed settlement will be null and void and of no force and effect. For a more detailed discussion of this litigation, please refer to the discussion under \u201cItem 3: Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the Restatements of Prior Period Financial Statements and\nour Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe face risks related to the restatements of our prior period financial statements and the prior period financial statements of our principal insurance company subsidiaries.\nWe have restated certain of our previously issued financial statements, including those of our principal insurance company subsidiaries, which are described in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2014, as well as in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of our insurance company subsidiary PHL Variable Insurance Company (\u201cPHL Variable\u201d) for the year ended December 31, 2012.\nThe Company is now current and timely in its SEC periodic reports, and PHL Variable became current and timely in its SEC periodic reports prior to ceasing filing periodic and other reports with the SEC, effective September 25, 2015, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(d). The Company expects to continue to face many of the risks and challenges related to the restatements, including the following:\n\u2022\nIn the process of restating our prior period financial statements, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, some of which existed as of December 31, 2015 and are reported under \u201cItem 9A: Controls and Procedures\u201d in this Form 10-K, and we may fail to remediate these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and other material weaknesses may be identified in the future, which would adversely affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting;\n\u2022\nThe extraordinary processes undertaken to effect the restatements, including restatements of our insurance company subsidiaries, may not have been adequate to identify and correct all errors in our prior period financial statements and, as a result, we may discover additional errors, and our financial statements remain subject to the risk of future restatement, which may impact our ability to timely complete future SEC filings;\n\u2022\nThe outcome of litigation and claims as well as regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders arising out of the restatements and the failure by the Company and PHL Variable to have filed certain previously delayed SEC reports on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nThe incurrence of significant expenses, including audit, consulting and other professional fees, related to the restatements, the completion of our financial statements on a timely and accurate basis and the remediation of weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures and the negative impact of those expenses on the financial resources of the holding company and its ability to meet its obligations;\n\u2022\nDiversion of management and other human resources attention from the operation of our business associated with the remediation of our internal controls;\n\u2022\nRisks associated with our insurance company subsidiaries\u2019 ability to amend and update on a timely basis registration statements filed under the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act; and\n\u2022\nRisks associated with our ongoing compliance obligations under the SEC Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order, which was approved by the SEC in March 2014 (the \u201cMarch 2014 Order\u201d), as was subsequently amended by an amended SEC administrative order approved by the SEC in August 2014 (the March 2014 Order, as amended, the \u201cAmended Order\u201d), and the risk of noncompliance with such Amended Order.\nWe cannot assure that all of the risks and challenges described above will be eliminated and that lost business opportunities can be recaptured or that general reputational harm will not persist. If one or more of the foregoing risks or challenges persist, our business, operations and financial condition are likely to be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which have not been fully remediated as of the filing date of this Form 10-K and we cannot assure you that other material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nAs reported in \u201cItem 9A: Controls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K, we have concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and that our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective as of December 31, 2015. While we have performed additional analyses and other procedures, and either implemented or plan to implement and test remediation measures as of the filing date of this Form 10-K, certain of the previously identified material weaknesses have not been fully addressed and remediated. We continue to improve our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures by, among other things:\n\u2022\nenhancing our existing accounting policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nimplementing changes in our finance and accounting organization;\n\u2022\nadopting new accounting and reporting processes and procedures; and\n\u2022\nintroducing new or enhanced accounting systems and processes.\nSome of the interim measures we have taken to address weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are manual, which are more time consuming to prepare, more prone to errors than computerized systems, and require more exhaustive audit processes. It is necessary for us to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting to prevent fraud and errors and to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures so that we can provide timely and reliable financial and other information. A failure to maintain adequate internal controls may adversely affect our ability to provide financial statements that accurately reflect our financial condition and timely report information. This could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, cause our securities to trade at a decreased price and cause an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. A failure to correct material weaknesses in our internal controls and to replace interim measures taken to address weaknesses could result in further restatements of financial statements and correction of other information filed with the SEC or delays in the filing of future SEC reports, the inability to update or file new registration statements covering the offer and sale of product offerings of our insurance company subsidiaries and the ability to access public markets for the offer and sale of our securities.\nAny orders, actions or rulings relating to any of the foregoing that are not in our favor could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unfavorable economic developments and the performance of the debt and equity markets.\nEconomic and market conditions materially and adversely affected us in the last recession. The economy may once again deteriorate. The resulting lack of credit, increase in defaults, lack of confidence in the financial sector, volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThese effects include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nLower fee revenue and higher expenses. Significant declines in equity markets would decrease assets in our variable annuity and variable life product lines, resulting in lower fee income and increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.\n\u2022\nRealized and unrealized losses in our fixed income portfolio. The value of the portfolio would be depressed by general interest rate increases or credit spread widening, as well as by illiquidity and by changes in assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of securities. Bonds supported by residential and commercial mortgages could experience losses if the delinquency rates of the underlying mortgage loans increase.\n\u2022\nRealized and unrealized losses in alternative asset classes. We invest in private equity funds, mezzanine funds, and other limited partnerships, which generate returns that are more volatile than other asset classes and are relatively illiquid and, therefore, may be harder to value or sell in adverse market conditions.\n\u2022\nHigher statutory reserve and capital requirements. Certain regulatory reserve and capital requirements incorporate actual and expected future capital market conditions and could increase materially in the event of significant equity market declines or changes in interest rates, credit spreads and credit default rates.\n\u2022\nLosses due to changes in accounting estimates. Significant accounting estimates may be materially affected by the equity and debt markets and their impact on expected customer behavior. For example, in setting amortization schedules for our deferred policy acquisition costs, we make assumptions about future market performance, interest rates and policyholder behavior.\n\u2022\nIncreased funding requirements for our pension plan. Future market declines could result in additional funding requirements. Also, the funding requirements of our pension plan are sensitive to interest rate changes. Should interest rates decrease materially, the plan liabilities would increase.\n\u2022\nHedging losses or increased reserve requirements in our variable annuity business. We use derivatives to hedge the value of certain guaranteed benefits. These hedges and other management procedures could prove ineffective, especially during times of significant market volatility. For benefits that are not hedged, such as minimum death benefits and minimum income benefits we could be required to increase reserves in the event of a significant decline in the equity markets.\nPersistent low interest rates or significant increases in interest rates could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur products expose us to significant interest rate risk. A substantial portion of our business is spread-based, meaning that profitability depends on our ability to invest premiums at yields in excess of the rates we credit to policyholders. The current low interest rate environment has meant that we have invested or reinvested cash flows at substantially lower yields than our existing portfolio yield, while our ability to reduce credited rates has been limited by contractual minimums. Persistent low interest rates could compound this spread compression. In addition, they could cause additional premium payments on products with flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and lower policy surrenders.\nPersistent low interest rates may also result in higher GAAP insurance liabilities. The long-term liability for profits followed by losses on the universal life business is particularly sensitive to interest rates.\nPersistent low interest rates could also result in higher statutory reserve and capital requirements. Our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to annual asset adequacy testing, which requires additional reserves to be posted if projected asset cash flows and future premiums are not able to support future policy claims and surrenders under a range of possible scenarios.\nLow interest rates also have increased the liability of our pension plans and other post-employment benefits. Further declines in interest rates could result in additional increases in these liabilities.\nConversely, if interest rates rise significantly, we could face an increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. At the same time, it could cause life insurance policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals to increase as policyholders seek investments with higher returns. This could require us to sell invested assets at a time when their prices are depressed, which could cause us to realize investment losses.\nLegal actions and proceedings are inherent in our businesses and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position or harm our businesses or reputation.\nWe are regularly involved in litigation and arbitration, both as a defendant and as a plaintiff. In addition, various regulatory bodies regularly make inquiries of us and, from time to time, conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws, securities laws, laws governing the activities of broker-dealers and other laws and regulations affecting our registered products. We are, and in the future may be, subject to and involved in legal actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of our businesses. Some of these proceedings have been brought, and may be brought in the future, on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Furthermore, certain institutional investors have purchased, or may purchase in the future, large numbers of life insurance policies in the secondary market and have asserted, or may assert, claims against us before regulatory agencies and in litigations. Substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could have an adverse effect on us or cause us reputational harm, which in turn could, among other items, harm our business prospects, result in regulatory or legislative responses and have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition to potential for legal actions and proceedings related to the ordinary course of our business, there is a risk of litigation and other claims as well as regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders arising out of the restatements and the failure by the Company to file SEC reports on a timely basis and the failure by our insurance company subsidiaries to have compliant registration statements covering certain insurance products offered and sold by them. The Company is providing information to the staff of the SEC in connection with the restatements, which may result in further regulatory actions by the SEC. The potential outcomes and claims are unpredictable and any orders, actions or rulings not in our favor could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIt is difficult to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of legal or regulatory proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses. We believe that the outcomes of our litigation and regulatory matters are not likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, given the large or indeterminate amounts and/or other remedies sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and regulatory matters, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the way we conduct our business and our financial condition, liquidity or consolidated financial statements in particular quarterly or annual periods. For a more detailed discussion of certain current litigation and other proceedings please refer to the discussion under \u201cItem 3: Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nDowngrades or withdrawals of debt and financial strength ratings could result in an increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals, adversely affect relationships with distributors, reduce new sales, limit our ability to trade in derivatives and increase our costs of, or reduce our access to, future borrowings.\nRating agencies assign Phoenix Life and our other insurance company subsidiaries\u2019 financial strength ratings, and assign us debt ratings, based in each case on their opinions of the Company\u2019s or its insurance company subsidiaries\u2019 ability to meet their respective financial obligations.\nOur ratings relative to other companies in the industry affect our competitive position. The Company, its insurance company subsidiaries and their securities have been placed under review with developing implications and positive outlook pending completion of the Merger. A number of events including insufficient progress on remediation, weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, the Merger not being completed, and any other events that could affect the ability of the Company to pay claims may cause downgrades or withdrawals which may cause reputational damage. This could materially and adversely affect our ability to distribute our products through unaffiliated third parties, new sales of our products, the persistency of existing customers, increase policy surrenders and withdrawals and our ability to borrow. We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response. At this time, we cannot estimate the impact of specific future rating agency actions on sales or persistency.\nIn light of the difficulties experienced by many financial institutions, including insurance companies, rating agencies have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews and requested additional information from the companies that they rate, including us. They may also adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.\nWe may not be able to hedge our positions due to the inability to replace hedges as a result of our credit rating.\nWe use derivative instruments to hedge the liability exposure and the volatility of earnings associated with certain variable and fixed indexed annuity liabilities. Certain derivative counterparty agreements of certain subsidiaries contain provisions that permit the parties to terminate the agreements upon the occurrence of a default under the indenture covering our 7.45% Quarterly Interest Bonds due 2032. In addition, certain of these agreements require our insurance companies\u2019 financial strength rating to be above a certain threshold. Given that our financial strength ratings are below a specified credit rating threshold in certain of our derivative agreements, the counterparties can request immediate payment, demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions, or trigger a termination of existing derivatives and/or future derivative transactions. In certain derivative counterparty agreements, our financial strength ratings have been below the specified threshold levels since March 2009 and, when requested, the Company has provided collateralization on certain of its derivative instruments.\nIf we are forced to terminate any derivative agreements, we may be unable to replace the derivative positions, thereby increasing our exposure to periods of significant and sustained downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility, or reduced interest rates, which could result in an increase in the valuation of the future policy benefit associated with such products and result in a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.\nOur actuarial reserve calculations, particularly for universal life death benefits and guaranteed annuity benefits, require many assumptions and significant management judgment, which, if incorrect, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe establish reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. A significant proportion of our reserves do not represent policyholder funds but rather are actuarial estimates based on assumptions that include future benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns), mortality, morbidity, and premium and policy persistency. As a result, we cannot be certain that the assets supporting our policy liabilities, together with future premiums, will be sufficient for payment of benefits and claims. If, in the future, we determine this to be the case, we would need to increase our reserves in the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may experience losses if capital market conditions, mortality or longevity experience, policyholder behavior (e.g., premium and policy persistency, benefit utilization rates) or other factors differ significantly from the assumptions that we used in pricing products or that are reflected in our current financial results.\nWe set prices for our insurance and annuity products based upon capital market assumptions, expected mortality or longevity and expected policyholder behavior. For capital market assumptions such as equity market returns and investment portfolio yields we use current market observations, historical information and management judgment. For mortality and longevity rates we use standard actuarial tables, company experience and management judgment. For policyholder behavior assumptions we use available industry and company data. Assumptions used in pricing our products generally are consistent with assumptions used to initially determine the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. Adverse experience relative to these assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations and financial condition.\nRecent trends in the life insurance industry may affect our mortality, premium and policy persistency, and investment earnings. The evolution of the financial needs of policyholders and the emergence of a secondary market for life insurance and increased availability and subsequent contraction of premium financing suggest that the reasons for some purchases of our products changed. At the same time, prior to 2009, we experienced an increase in life insurance sales to older individuals. While we instituted certain controls and procedures to screen applicants, we believe that our sales of universal life products include sales of policies to third-party investors who, at the time of policy origination, had no insurable interest in the insured.\nDeviations in experience from our pricing assumptions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on the profitability of certain universal life products. Most of our current products permit us to increase charges and adjust crediting rates during the life of the policy or contract (subject to guarantees in the policies and contracts). However, most of our contracts are currently at or close to their minimum guaranteed crediting rates. In 2011 and 2010, we implemented increases in the cost of insurance (\u201cCOI\u201d) rates for certain universal life policies. However, these and any other permitted adjustments do not allow us to recoup past losses and may not be sufficient to maintain profitability in the future. In addition, increasing charges on in force policies or contracts may adversely affect our relationships with distributors, future sales and surrenders. Furthermore, some of our in force business consists of products that do not permit us to adjust the charges and credited rates of in force policies or contracts.\nOur fixed indexed annuity products have required us to make pricing assumptions about the behavior of policyholders in a market segment with which we are not historically familiar and for product features for which there is limited long-term industry experience. In particular, if our pricing assumptions with respect to persistency and benefit utilization in the future prove inaccurate, we may experience an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nAdverse experience relative to our pricing assumptions could also result in higher amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. The recovery of deferred policy acquisition costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business. See \u201cItem 7: Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d in this Form 10-K. If our estimates of future gross profits or margins cannot support the continued amortization or recovery of deferred policy acquisition costs the amortization of such costs is accelerated in the period in which the pricing assumptions are changed, resulting in an \u201cunlocking\u201d charge to income. Such adjustments may in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nGuaranteed benefits within our products that protect policyholders against significant downturns in equity markets may decrease our earnings, increase the volatility of our results if hedging strategies prove ineffective, result in higher hedging costs and expose us to increased counterparty risk, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nCertain of our products include guaranteed benefits. These include GMDBs, GMABs, GMWBs and GMIBs. Periods of significant and sustained downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility or reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of the future policy benefit associated with such products, resulting in a reduction to earnings. We use derivative instruments to hedge the liability exposure and the volatility of earnings associated with some of these liabilities and, even when these and other actions would otherwise successfully mitigate the risks related to these benefits, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. In addition, we are subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, including lower withdrawals or mortality, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed. Hedging instruments we hold to manage product and other risks have not, and may continue to not, perform as intended or expected, resulting in higher realized losses. Market conditions can also result in losses on product related hedges and such losses may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged. These factors, individually or collectively, may adversely affect our profitability, financial condition or liquidity.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses or result in losses.\nWe have devoted significant resources to develop and periodically update our risk management policies and procedures to reflect our ongoing review of our risks. However, our policies and procedures to monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective and may leave us exposed to unidentified and unanticipated risks. We use models in many aspects of our operations, including but not limited to the pricing of products, estimation of actuarial reserves, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and the valuation of certain other assets and liabilities. These models rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. In addition, the risk of a natural or man-made catastrophe, pandemic, malicious act, terrorist act, or the occurrence of climate change, could adversely affect mortality, morbidity, or other relevant factors and, as a result, have a significant negative impact on our business. Our risk management efforts and other precautionary plans and activities may not adequately predict the impact on our business from such events.\nManagement of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Past or future misconduct by our employees or employees of our vendors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. A failure of our computer systems or a compromise of their security could also subject us to regulatory sanctions or other claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur statutory capital could decrease or our capital requirements could increase and adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct the majority of our business through Phoenix Life and PHL Variable. Accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by their respective insurance regulators and the NAIC. In addition, NAIC regulations define minimum RBC requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks, which are intended to be used by insurance regulators to identify deteriorating or weakly capitalized companies. Separately, some rating agencies have their own capital models that are used to assess capital adequacy as part of the rating process.\nStatutory surplus and regulatory or capital requirements may increase or decrease due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to the following: the amount of statutory income generated by our insurance company subsidiaries, changes in interest rates and equity market levels, unrealized gains or losses on equity and certain fixed income holdings, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, changes in the credit quality of our fixed income investments, changes in policy reserves, funding requirements of our pension plan, additional reserve requirements as a result of annually required asset adequacy testing, capital strain from the issuance of new business, changes in the capital models or applicable risk factors and changes in statutory accounting rules or regulatory determinations. Most of these factors are outside of our control. One or more of these factors could significantly decrease statutory surplus or increase required RBC. If so, we could experience downgrades, loss of distribution relationships, higher surrenders and increased regulatory supervision.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to generate earnings growth in new market segments, particularly the sale of fixed indexed annuities to middle market customers.\nWe are implementing a business plan that leverages existing product manufacturing strengths and partnering capabilities to focus new business development in areas that are less capital intensive and appeal to distributors with middle market clients. We have limited experience in the middle market and in the design and sale of fixed indexed annuities. These products have required us to institute new processes for ensuring product suitability, executing hedges using derivatives and processing transactions. In addition, the ultimate profitability of these products is significantly influenced by future investment earnings, policy holder behavior and estimates of longevity. If the new risk management processes we designed prove inadequate, or if future investment earnings, policyholder behavior or longevity differs significantly from expectations, our results from operations may be adversely affected and our growth may not be sustained.\nOur valuation of debt securities and equity securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe record debt and equity securities at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, the valuation of securities may require the adoption of certain estimates and assumptions. In addition, prices provided by independent broker quotes or independent pricing services that are used in the determination of fair value can vary significantly for a particular security. As a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods which are more complex. These values may not be ultimately realizable in a market transaction and may change very rapidly as market conditions change or assumptions are modified. Significant changes in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of a security requires management to assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) has occurred. The decision on whether to record an OTTI or write-down is determined in part by our assessment of the financial condition and prospects of a particular issuer, projections of future cash flows and recoverability of the particular security as well as management\u2019s assertion of whether it is more likely than not that we will sell the securities before recovery. See \u201cItem 7: Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d in this Form 10-K for further information regarding our impairment decision-making process. Management\u2019s determination of whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary includes our analysis of the underlying credit and our intention and ability not to have to sell the security, versus the extent and duration of a decline in value. Our conclusions on such assessments may ultimately prove to be incorrect as facts and circumstances change, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nWe may incur losses if our reinsurers are unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under reinsurance agreements. The availability, pricing and terms of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses.\nWe use reinsurance agreements to limit potential losses, reduce exposure to larger risks and provide capital relief with regard to certain reserves. Under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Consequently, reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims and we assume credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from our reinsurers. Although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers, the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of reinsurance. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain available to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as have been historically available. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net exposure or develop other alternatives to reinsurance. Any of these alternatives may adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe might be unable to attract or retain personnel who are key to our business.\nThe success of our business is dependent to a large extent on our ability to attract and retain key employees. Competition in the job market for senior executives and professionals such as sales personnel, technology professionals, finance, actuaries and investment professionals can be intense. In general, our employees are not subject to employment contracts or non-compete agreements. Difficulty in attracting and retaining employees could have a negative impact on us.\nOur business operations and results could be adversely affected by inadequate performance of third-party relationships.\nWe are dependent on certain third-party relationships to maintain essential business operations. These services include, but are not limited to, information technology infrastructure including cyber security, application systems support, transfer agent and cash management services, custodial services, records storage management, backup tape management, security pricing services, medical information, payroll and employee benefit programs.\nWe periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these agreements and there can be no assurance that their terms will remain acceptable to such third parties or us. An interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties or any material delay or inability to deliver essential services could materially affect our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe occurrence of unanticipated events or a failure in cyber or other information security systems could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information and impact the availability of our systems, all of which may adversely affect our results of operations or harm our business reputation.\nWe transmit, receive, process and retain customer and Company data on our computer systems, and we rely on sophisticated technologies for a variety of functions, including processing claims and applications, providing information to customers, business partners and employees, performing actuarial analyses and maintaining financial records. Although we attempt to protect personal, confidential and proprietary information, our computer systems may be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations that may render this data susceptible to breach. While, to date, the Company is not aware of a material breach of its cybersecurity, administrative or technical controls, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber-incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent future physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems. The number and complexity of cyber-related threats continue to increase over time.\nSystems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform our business functions in a timely manner, which could hurt our relationships with customers and business partners. In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, a pandemic, an industrial accident, a blackout, a terrorist attack, computer virus or cyber war, the systems upon which we rely may be inaccessible to our customers, business partners or employees for an extended period of time, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to conduct business, particularly if the problem affects our data processing, transmission, storage or retrieval systems, destroys valuable data or hinders the ability of employees to perform their job responsibilities or suppliers to provide goods or services.\nThe failure of our computer systems for any reason could significantly impede or interrupt our business operations and could result in compromised security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers and business partners, as well as high remediation costs, loss of revenue or customers, legal liability or regulatory action imposed by U.S. federal or state government or reputational harm.\nWhile we maintain cyber liability insurance, it may not be sufficient to protect against all loss.\nWe face strong competition in our businesses from insurance companies and other financial services firms. If we are unable to price our products competitively or provide competitive service we could lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. While there is no single company that we identify as a dominant competitor in our business, many of our competitors are substantially larger and enjoy better financial strength ratings, more financial resources and greater marketing and distribution capabilities. Our products compete with similar products sold by other insurance companies and also with savings and investment products offered by banks, asset managers, and broker-dealers. Larger competitors with better financial strength ratings, greater financial resources, marketing and distribution capabilities are better positioned competitively. Larger firms are also able to better withstand market disruption, offer more competitive pricing and more effectively access debt and equity capital. Moreover, a significant proportion of sales in the life insurance and annuity industries represent exchanges from one company\u2019s to another company\u2019s products. To the extent that a more competitive product alternative with better product features is offered by another company, we could experience higher policy surrenders.\nIf we fail to compete effectively in this environment, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a holding company, The Phoenix Companies, Inc., depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to transfer funds to meet its obligations and pay shareholder dividends.\nThe Phoenix Companies, Inc. is a holding company and has no operations of its own. Its ability to pay interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations and to pay dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses depends primarily upon the surplus and earnings of Phoenix Life and the ability of this subsidiary to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds. Payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds by Phoenix Life are restricted by the applicable laws and regulations, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. Changes to these laws or the application or implementation of those laws by regulatory agencies could constrain the ability of the holding company to meet its debt obligations and corporate expenses.\nIn 2013, 2014 and 2015, The Phoenix Companies, Inc. made capital contributions for the benefit of PHL Variable Insurance Company and incurred significant restatement expenses related to audit, consulting and legal fees. The need for additional capital contributions to operating subsidiaries or an inability to reduce expenses at the holding company could constrain the ability of the holding company to meet its debt obligations.\nPhoenix may not have sufficient capital resources available to fund PHL Variable\u2019s operations and capital needs.\nSubstantially all new insurance products sold by Phoenix are sold through its subsidiary, PHL Variable. As a holding company with no business operations independent of the business conducted through its operating subsidiaries, Phoenix primarily relies on dividends from its subsidiaries to provide capital to PHL Variable as and when needed for its capital requirements and business operations, which include maintenance of its regulatory capital ratios, the writing of new life insurance and annuity products, cash flow needs, and the satisfaction of its obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt and other expenses.\nAs a result of discussions with its regulators related to an intercompany reinsurance treaty between Phoenix Life and PHL Variable, effective June 30, 2015, Phoenix completed a de-stacking of its insurance company subsidiaries, effective July 1, 2015. Further, Phoenix agreed with its New York regulator that it would not use any future dividends paid by Phoenix Life to meet the capital needs of PHL Variable. Upon the effectiveness of the de-stacking, each of the Company\u2019s insurance company subsidiaries became a direct subsidiary of Phoenix. As a result of the de-stacking, an existing commitment by Phoenix Life to maintain the risk-based capital of PHL Variable at 125% Company Action Level was extinguished.\nPhoenix\u2019s holding company cash and non-affiliated securities at December 31, 2015 and other capital sources, such as dividends from operating subsidiaries other than Phoenix Life and external financing, are available to assist PHL Variable, if necessary, and together with PHL Variable\u2019s own capital, are believed to be sufficient to meet PHL Variable\u2019s anticipated operating and capital needs. However there can be no assurance that the combination of Phoenix\u2019s assistance and PHL Variable\u2019s own resources will be adequate to meet PHL Variable\u2019s future operating and capital needs or to grow its business. The restriction on the use of Phoenix Life dividends and the extinguishment of Phoenix Life\u2019s commitment to maintain the risk-based capital of PHL Variable may adversely affect PHL Variable\u2019s ability to meet its cash and debt obligations, which may slow or cease its ability to write new life insurance and annuity business. If PHL Variable is unable to meet its capital needs either by itself or with assistance from Phoenix, PHL Variable could become subject to increased regulatory oversight by its domestic insurance regulator or to other regulatory actions including rehabilitation, any of which may materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operation.\nWe might need to fund deficiencies in our closed block, which would adversely impact results of operations and could also result in a reduction in investments in our ongoing business.\nWe have allocated assets to our closed block to produce cash flows that, together with additional revenues from the closed block policies, are reasonably expected to support our obligations relating to these policies. Our allocation of assets to the closed block was based on actuarial assumptions about the performance of policies in the closed block and the continuation of the non-guaranteed policyholder dividend scales in effect for 2000, as well as assumptions about the investment earnings the closed block assets will generate over time. Since actual performance is likely to be different from these assumptions, it is possible that the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies included in the closed block will prove insufficient to provide for the benefits guaranteed under these policies even if the non-guaranteed policyholder dividend scale were to be reduced. If this were to occur, we would have to fund the resulting shortfall from assets outside of the closed block, which could adversely affect our results of operations and reduce our ability to invest in other ongoing businesses.\nTax law and policy are frequently reviewed and changed by the Internal Revenue Service and Congress and future changes in laws or regulations could unfavorably affect our tax costs and tax assets or make some of our products less attractive to consumers.\nSignificant and fundamental changes in U.S. federal income tax laws, U.S. Treasury and other regulations have been made in recent years and additional changes are likely. Any such change may affect us and the products we offer. Moreover, judicial decisions, regulations or administrative pronouncements could unfavorably affect our tax costs and tax assets or make certain of our products less attractive to consumers.\nCertain products we offer, primarily life insurance and annuities, receive favorable tax treatment under current federal and state tax law. This favorable treatment may be considered as providing certain of our products a competitive tax advantage over non-insurance products. In particular, for individual owners of life insurance policies and annuity contracts, earnings credited to these policies and contracts generally are tax-deferred until such time as the amounts are withdrawn from the policies or contracts. This differs from the treatment of dividend or interest earnings on other investments. Moreover, for life insurance, the death benefit proceeds are often received tax-free. While an increasing proportion of our annuity contracts are issued in connection with Individual Retirement Accounts (\u201cIRAs\u201d), for which the tax-deferral benefit is the same regardless of whether the IRA is in connection with an annuity, annuities in IRAs often provide lifetime payout guarantees not offered by other IRA investments.\nThe tax consequences associated with our products could be altered at any time by legislative, judicial, or administrative action. Any such action that increases the taxation on our products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products making them less competitive.\nIn the recent past, there have been proposals to modify the tax treatment of IRAs, including one that would result in more rapid taxation of after-death distributions. These proposals do not target annuities in IRAs, but would impact all IRAs to the same extent. As a result, many of the competing IRA investment options would also be impacted.\nWith respect to life insurance company taxation, the administration\u2019s budget proposals in recent years have included changes in the computation of the dividends received deduction relative to both general account and separate account dividends. If enacted, these actions could increase our taxable income and unfavorably impact our tax provision allocated to continuing operations, which would reduce our consolidated net income. The current administration has proposed certain other changes which, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our ability to sell our products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies.\nWe also benefit from certain tax provisions available to most insurance corporations, including but not limited to, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends-received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits) and insurance reserve deductions. Congress, as well as foreign, state and local governments, also considers from time to time legislation that could modify or eliminate these benefits, as well as other corporate tax provisions, thereby increasing our tax costs. If such legislation were to be adopted, our consolidated balance sheet and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe cannot predict whether any relevant tax legislation will be enacted, what the impact of such legislation would be on our tax costs and sales of our products, what the specific terms of any such legislation will be or whether any such legislation would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state regulation may increase our cost of doing business, impose additional reserve or capital requirements, levy financial assessments, or constrain our operating and financial flexibility, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities including state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general and foreign regulators. In light of recent events involving certain financial institutions and the last recession, the U.S. government has heightened its oversight of the financial services industry. In addition, it is possible that these authorities may adopt enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises in the financial services industry and to assure the stability of institutions under their supervision. We cannot estimate whether such regulatory proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such regulation could have on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or liquidity.\nEach of the authorities that regulates us exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), which implements significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape and will impact institutions operating in many segments of the financial services industry, including the Company. Although certain provisions became effective immediately, many of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s provisions require adoption of rules that will govern implementation. The Dodd-Frank Act may, among other things, increase our regulatory compliance burden by requiring us to invest management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our policies and procedures and the manner in which we conduct our business. The U. S. government has created the Federal Insurance Office (\u201cFIO\u201d) under the Dodd-Frank Act as a branch of the U. S. Treasury Department. Under its charge to improve consumer protection, the FIO may regulate actual product design and mandate additional disclosure rules. We are uncertain as to the impact that this new legislation and regulatory guidance will have on the Company and cannot assure that it will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nState insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things:\n\u2022\nFinancial considerations, including standards of solvency, statutory reserves, reinsurance and capital adequacy;\n\u2022\nTrade practices, market conduct and licensing of companies and agents;\n\u2022\nMandating certain insurance benefits and regulating certain premium rates;\n\u2022\nApproval of policy forms and certain other related materials;\n\u2022\nPermitted types and concentration of investments;\n\u2022\nPermitted dividends or other distributions, as well as transactions between affiliates and changes in control; and\n\u2022\nApproval of interest payments on surplus notes.\nChanges in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Compliance with these laws and regulations is also time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may increase our direct and indirect compliance costs and other expenses of doing business, thus having an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may be subject to regulation by the Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) in connection to providing annuity products to IRA participants.\nIn April 2015, the DOL released a notice of proposed rulemaking to modify and expand the ERISA conflict of interest rules. These rules could be finalized in 2016, with an effective date in 2017. The proposed rules would impose fiduciary duties on anyone getting paid for advice related to a retirement investment decision, which would include insurance agents selling Individual Retirement Annuities. As current DOL rules do not cover IRAs, the expansion could have a new impact on our sales. While the proposed rules continue to permit commission-based annuity sales, there would be additional requirements on insurance agents and producers regarding the information to be provided to IRA participants as well as the standards that must be met for agents and producers in connection with such sales. It is unclear as to the extent that these new rules will impact agents and producers selling Phoenix fixed indexed annuities.\nWe cannot predict whether the proposed DOL rule will ultimately be adopted, what changes may be made to it prior to adoption, or how the rule would impact our business if it were adopted.\nRegulatory actions or examinations could result in financial losses or harm to our businesses.\nVarious regulatory bodies regularly make inquiries of us and, from time to time, conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws, securities laws and laws governing the activities of broker-dealers. During the past several years, there has been a significant increase in federal and state regulatory activity relating to financial services companies, with a number of recent regulatory inquiries focusing on valuation, COI increase issues and market conduct. Financial services companies also have been the subject of broad industry inquiries by state regulators and attorneys general which do not appear to be company-specific, such as business practices upon notification of death. We continue to cooperate with the applicable regulatory authorities in these matters. We may be subject to further related or unrelated inquiries or actions in the future. In light of recent events involving certain financial institutions, the U.S. government has heightened its oversight of the financial services industry in general and of the insurance industry in particular. Further, recent adverse economic and market events may have the effect of encouraging litigation, arbitration and regulatory action in response to the increased frequency and magnitude of investment losses, which may result in unfavorable judgments, awards and settlements, regulatory fines and an increase in our related legal expenses.\nIt is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of regulatory proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses. We believe that the outcomes of regulatory matters are not likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. However, given the inherent unpredictability of regulatory matters, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nWe could have material losses in the future from our discontinued reinsurance business.\nIn 1999, we discontinued our reinsurance operations through a combination of sale, reinsurance and placement of certain retained group accident and health reinsurance business into run-off. We adopted a formal plan to stop writing new contracts covering these risks and to end the existing contracts as soon as those contracts would permit. However, we remain liable for claims under contracts which have not been commuted.\nWe have established reserves for claims and related expenses that we expect to pay on our discontinued group accident and health reinsurance business. These reserves are based on currently known facts and estimates about, among other things, the amount of insured losses and expenses that we believe we will pay, the period over which they will be paid, the amount of reinsurance we believe we will collect from our retrocessionaires and the likely legal and administrative costs of winding down the business.\nWe expect our reserves and reinsurance to cover the run-off of the business; however, the nature of the underlying risks is such that the claims may take years to reach the reinsurers involved. Therefore, we expect to pay claims out of existing estimated reserves as the level of business diminishes. In addition, unfavorable or favorable claims and/or reinsurance recovery experience is reasonably possible and could result in our recognition of additional losses or gains in future years. In establishing our reserves described above for the payment of insured losses and expenses on this discontinued business, we have made assumptions about the likely outcome of the disputes referred to above, including an assumption that substantial recoveries would be available from our reinsurers on all of our discontinued reinsurance business. However, the inherent uncertainty of arbitrations and lawsuits, including the uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements we may enter into in the future would be on favorable terms, makes it hard to predict outcomes with certainty. Given the need to use estimates in establishing loss reserves, our actual net ultimate exposure likely will differ from our current estimate. If future facts and circumstances differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions about future events with respect to our discontinued reinsurance business, our current reserves may need to be increased materially, with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board.\nIt is possible that future accounting standards which we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could significantly affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under \u201cItem 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Adoption of New Accounting Standards\u201d in this Form 10-K for additional information.", "PERMNO": 89008, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "PNX"}
