{"cik": "880266", "company": "AGCO CORP /DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe make forward-looking statements in this report, in other materials we file with the SEC, on our website, or in materials that we otherwise release to the public. In addition, our senior management makes forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and others. Statements, including the statements contained in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d concerning our future operations, prospects, strategies, products, manufacturing facilities, legal proceedings, financial condition, financial performance (including growth and earnings) and demand for our products and services, and other statements of our strategic plans, beliefs or expectations, net sales, industry conditions, currency translation impacts, market demand, farm incomes, weather conditions, commodity and protein prices, general economic conditions, availability of financing, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, margins, production volumes, cost reduction initiatives, investments in product development, compliance with financial covenants, support from lenders, recovery of amounts under guarantee, uncertain income tax provisions, funding of our pension and postretirement benefit plans, or realization of net deferred tax assets, are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements we make are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various assumptions, risks and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others, those set forth below and in the other documents that we file with the SEC. There also are other factors that we may not describe, generally because we currently do not perceive them to be material, or likely to become material, that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\nThese risks could impact our business in a number of ways, including by negatively impacting our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For simplicity, below we collectively refer to these potential material impacts on our \u201cperformance.\u201d\nWe expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business could be materially adversely impacted if the coronavirus outbreak continues in duration and severity or otherwise impacts our manufacturing and supply chain or demand for our products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has, and we expect may continue to, negatively impact our business, and further impacts\nwill depend on future developments, which are unpredictable, including the duration of the pandemic, the timing, distribution and impact of vaccinations and possible mutations of the virus that are more contagious or resistant to current vaccines. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility in the global economy and has led to substantially reduced economic activity, employment disruptions, supply chain constraints and delays, and declines in consumer demand. Measures taken by governments around the world, as well as businesses, including us, and the general public in order to limit the spread of COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact our business and overall financial condition. These measures have included travel bans or restriction limits, quarantines, shelter in place orders, curfews, business and government office closures, increased border controls or closures, port closures and transportation restrictions. The impacts of such measures could include, but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022Our industry may experience declines in global market demand, thus reducing sales of our products.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic is projected to have minimal impact on global crop production. Most farm operations, which generally have been deemed \u201cessential\u201d throughout the pandemic, are working to relatively normal levels. However, the consumption of grain for food, fuel (including ethanol) and livestock feed was negatively impacted by economic constraints caused by the pandemic during the first half of 2020. During the second half of 2020, grain consumption started to recover, consistent with improving economic activities and increased grain exports to China, thus reducing forecasts for ending grain inventories and raising soft commodity prices. Future market demand for agricultural equipment will be influenced by, among other things, farm income, farm land values, weather conditions, the demand for agricultural commodities, commodity and protein prices, and general economic conditions, and the decrease in market demand because of these factors could materially negatively impact our results of operations and overall financial condition.\n\u2022Deteriorating economic and political conditions, such as increased unemployment, economic slowdown or recessions, could cause further decreases in sales of our products.\n\u2022We may experience adverse fluctuations in foreign currency rates, particularly an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against key market foreign currencies, which could negatively impact our sales and overall business performance.\n\u2022Governmental guidance, directives or regulations around the world could result in factory shutdowns and reduced production related to factory shutdowns or higher absentee rates. We have had to suspend operations at production facilities due to a rise in COVID-19 infection rates and due to government mandated closures in the past, and may have further factory shutdowns in the future.\n\u2022We could incur additional operating costs due to the adherence of cleaning requirements and social distancing guidelines.\n\u2022We have severely limited travel by our employees and have taken measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees at our factories. These measures include employee health screening, using personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning and sanitation efforts, reworking factory layouts and staggering production schedules to conform with social distancing recommendations. We may also from time to time have to temporarily close factories due to the level of COVID-19 cases at any factory. In addition, most of our non-factory workforce are under work-at-home arrangements. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent material adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022We may experience increased costs due to remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing guidelines and the need for personal protective equipment, in addition to the absence of employees due to illness.\n\u2022Our factories are dependent upon parts and components manufactured by others, and to the extent that our suppliers are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, it will reduce the availability, or result in delays, of parts and components to us, which in turn could interrupt our ability to produce and sell completed products.\n\u2022Freight channels may be disrupted due to additional safety requirements imposed by port authorities and/or capacity constraints experienced by our freight carriers. As a result, we may also incur increased logistics costs.\n\u2022Declines in equity markets and the valuation of assets may negatively affect our pension plan assets, and, if this occurs again, we likely will incur increased pension expenses and funding requirements related to the fair value of our pension plan assets.\n\u2022Although we currently believe we have sufficient available funding to support our business, and we have not experienced a significant increase in borrowing costs, the severity and length of the COVID-19 pandemic could have material negative impacts to our financial condition. This, in turn, could affect our credit ratings and borrowing costs.\n\u2022While we have initiated several cost-saving and capital deployment measures and strategies to monitor and manage our cash flows and operating expenses, these measures may not be sufficient to prevent adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022We may be required to record significant impairment charges with respect to certain noncurrent assets such as goodwill and other intangible assets and equity method investments, whose fair values may be negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also may be required to write-down inventory that is deemed obsolete due to decreased sales.\n\u2022If economic conditions continue to deteriorate, we may experience slower collections and larger write-offs of accounts receivable. Our customers and dealers may request payment deferrals or contract modifications. In addition, our finance joint ventures also may experience slower collections and greater write-offs of accounts receivable, which would result in reduced earnings, if not losses, for us from our investments in the retail joint ventures.\n\u2022Government authorities in the U.S. and throughout the world may increase or impose new income or indirect taxes, or revise interpretations of existing tax regulations, as a means of financing the costs of stimulus and other measures taken, or that might be enacted and taken in the future, to protect populations and economies from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such actions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\u2022It is unclear when a full economic recovery will occur and both the speed and extent of that recovery. However, we expect the impact of COVID-19 to continue well into 2021.\nMarket, Economic and Geopolitical Risks\nOur financial results depend entirely upon the agricultural industry, and factors that adversely affect the agricultural industry generally, including declines in the general economy, increases in farm input costs, weather conditions and lower commodity and protein prices, adversely affect us.\nOur success depends entirely on the vitality of the agricultural industry. Historically, the agricultural industry has been cyclical and subject to a variety of economic and other factors. Sales of agricultural equipment, in turn, also are cyclical and generally reflect the economic health of the agricultural industry. The economic health of the agricultural industry is affected by\nnumerous factors, including farm income, farm input costs, farm land values and debt levels, all of which are influenced by levels of commodity and protein prices, acreage planted, crop yields, agricultural product demand (including crops used as renewable energy sources), government policies and government subsidies. The economic health also is influenced by general economic conditions, interest rate and exchange rate levels, and the availability of financing for retail customers, including financing subsidies to farmers, which can be significant in countries such as Brazil, as discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Trends in the agricultural industry, such as farm consolidations, may affect the agricultural equipment market. In addition, weather conditions, such as floods, heat waves or droughts, and pervasive livestock or crop diseases affect farmers\u2019 buying decisions. Downturns in the agricultural industry due to these or other factors, which could vary by market, can result in decreases in demand for agricultural equipment, which would adversely affect our performance. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of many of these factors and the resulting volatility in demand make it difficult for us to accurately predict sales and optimize production. This, in turn, can result in higher costs, including inventory carrying costs and underutilized manufacturing capacity. During previous downturns in the agricultural industry, we experienced significant and prolonged declines in our performance, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar market fluctuations in the future.\nThe agricultural equipment industry is highly seasonal, and seasonal fluctuations significantly impact our performance.\nThe agricultural equipment business is highly seasonal, which causes our quarterly results and our cash flow to fluctuate during the year. Farmers generally purchase agricultural equipment in the Spring and Fall in conjunction with the major planting and harvesting seasons. In addition, the fourth quarter typically is a significant period for retail sales because of year-end tax planning considerations, the increase in availability of funds from completed harvests, and the timing of dealer incentives. Our net sales and income from operations historically have been the lowest in the first quarter and have increased in subsequent quarters as dealers anticipate increased retail sales in subsequent quarters.\nMost of our sales depend on the availability of financing to retail customers, and any disruption in their ability to obtain financing, whether due to economic downturns or otherwise, will result in the sale of fewer products by us. In addition, the collectability of receivables that are created from our sales, as well as from such retail financing, is critical to our business.\nMost retail sales of our products are financed, either by our AGCO Finance joint ventures or by a bank or other private lender. The AGCO Finance joint ventures, which are controlled by Rabobank and are dependent upon Rabobank for financing as well, finance approximately 40% to 50% of the retail sales of our tractors and combines in the markets where the joint ventures operate. Any difficulty by Rabobank in continuing to provide that financing, or any business decision by Rabobank as the controlling member not to fund the business or particular aspects of it (for example, a particular country or region), would require the joint ventures to find other sources of financing (which may be difficult to obtain) or would require us to find other sources of retail financing for our dealers and their retail customers.\nIf we are unable to obtain other sources, our dealers and their retail customers would be required to utilize other retail financing providers, which may or may not be available. In an economic downturn, we expect that financing for capital equipment purchases generally would become more difficult or more expensive to obtain. To the extent that financing is not available, or available only at unattractive prices, our sales would be negatively impacted.\nBoth AGCO and our AGCO Finance joint ventures have substantial accounts receivable from dealers and retail customers, and we both are adversely impacted when the collectability of these receivables is not consistent with historical experience. This collectability is dependent on the financial strength of the agricultural industry, which in turn is dependent upon the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. In addition, the AGCO Finance joint ventures may project estimated credit losses that exceed expectations and adversely affect their financial condition and results of operations. The finance joint ventures lease equipment as well and also may experience residual value losses that exceed expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected returns at lease maturity. To the extent that defaults and losses are higher than expected, our equity in the net earnings of the finance joint ventures would be less, or there could be losses, which could materially impact our performance.\nA majority of our sales and manufacturing take place outside the United States, and, as a result, we are exposed to risks related to foreign laws, taxes, economic conditions, labor supply and relations, political conditions and governmental policies as well as U.S. laws governing who we sell to and how we conduct business. These risks may delay or reduce our realization of value from our international operations.\nA majority of our sales are derived from sales outside the United States. The foreign countries in which our sales are the greatest are Germany, France, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Finland and Canada. We have significant manufacturing operations in France, Germany, Brazil, Italy and Finland, and we have established manufacturing operations in emerging\nmarkets, such as China. Many of our sales involve products that are manufactured in one country and sold in a different country, and, therefore, our performance can be adversely affected by adverse changes, in either the country of origin or the country of destination, in the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, particularly the factors that impact the delivered cost of our products. Our business practices in these foreign countries must comply with not just local law, but also U.S. law, including limitations on where and to whom we may sell products and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d). We have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of these laws, but it is difficult to identify and prevent violations. Significant violations could subject us to fines and other penalties as well as increased compliance costs. Some of our international operations also are, or might become, subject to various risks that are not present in domestic operations, including restrictions on dividends and the repatriation of funds. Foreign developing markets may present special risks, such as unavailability of financing, inflation, slow economic growth, price controls and difficulties in complying with U.S. regulations.\nDomestic and foreign political developments and government regulations and policies directly affect the international agricultural industry, which affects the demand for agricultural equipment. If demand for agricultural equipment declines, our performance will be adversely affected. As discussed previously in \u201cRisks Related to the COVID -19 Pandemic,\u201d the pandemic has caused a global recession and increased economic and demand uncertainty. The pandemic impacts, in addition to related or unrelated application, modification or adoption of laws, regulations, trade agreements or policies, can adversely affect the agricultural industry, including the imposition of import and export duties and quotas, expropriation and potentially burdensome taxation, could have an adverse effect on our business. Trade restrictions, including potential withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, and imposition of new (and retaliatory) tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, could limit our ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in the international markets in which we operate and impair our ability to expand our business by offering new technologies, products and services. These changes also can impact the cost of the products we manufacture, including the cost of steel. These trade restrictions and changes in, or uncertainty surrounding, global trade policy may affect our competitive position.\nAs previously discussed, the health of the agricultural industry and the ability of our international dealers and retail customers to operate their businesses, in general, are affected by domestic and foreign government programs that provide economic support to farmers. As a result, farm income levels and the ability of farmers to obtain advantageous financing and other protections would be reduced to the extent that any such programs are curtailed or eliminated. Any such reductions likely would result in a decrease in demand for agricultural equipment. For example, a decrease or elimination of current price protections for commodities or of subsidy payments for farmers in the European Union, the United States, Brazil or elsewhere in South America would negatively impact the operations of farmers in those regions, and, as a result, our sales may decline if these farmers delay, reduce or cancel purchases of our products. In emerging markets, some of these (and other) risks can be greater than they might be elsewhere. In addition, in some cases, the financing provided by the AGCO Finance joint ventures or by others is supported by a government subsidy or guarantee. The programs under which those subsidies and guarantees are provided generally are of limited duration and subject to renewal and contain various caps and other limitations. In some markets, for example Brazil, this support is quite significant. In the event the governments that provide this support elect not to renew these programs, and were financing not available on reasonable terms, whether through our joint ventures or otherwise, our performance would be negatively impacted.\nAs a result of the multinational nature of our business and the acquisitions that we have made over time, our corporate and tax structures are complex, with a significant portion of our operations being held through foreign holding companies. As a result, it can be inefficient, from a tax perspective, for us to repatriate or otherwise transfer funds, and we may be subject to taxation from multiple tax jurisdictions. In addition, we must comply with a greater level of tax-related regulation and reviews by multiple governmental units than do companies with a more simplified structure. Our foreign and U.S. operations also routinely sell products to, and license technology to other operations of ours. The pricing of these intra-company transactions is subject to regulation and review as well. While we make every effort to comply with all applicable tax laws, audits and other reviews by governmental units could result in our being required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties.\nWe face significant competition, and, if we are unable to compete successfully against other agricultural equipment manufacturers, we will lose dealers and their retail customers and our net sales and profitability will decline.\nThe agricultural equipment business is highly competitive, particularly in our major markets. Our two key competitors, Deere & Company and CNH Industrial N.V., are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources. In addition, in some markets, we compete with smaller regional competitors with significant market share in a single country or group of countries. Our competitors may substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing, including discounting, of products that compete with our products, which would necessitate our making similar expenditures.\nIn addition, competitive pressures in the agricultural equipment business may affect the market prices of new and used equipment, which, in turn, may adversely affect our performance.\nWe maintain an independent dealer and distribution network in the markets where we sell products. The financial and operational capabilities of our dealers and distributors are critical to our ability to compete in these markets. In addition, we compete with other manufacturers of agricultural equipment for dealers. If we are unable to compete successfully against other agricultural equipment manufacturers, we could lose dealers and their retail customers and performance may decline.\nOur expansion plans in emerging markets entail significant risks.\nOur long-term strategy includes establishing a greater manufacturing and supply-chain and/or marketing presence in emerging markets such as India, China and Africa. As we progress with these efforts, it will involve a significant investment of capital and other resources and entail various risks. These include risks attendant to obtaining necessary governmental approvals and the construction of facilities in a timely manner and within cost estimates, the establishment of supply channels, the commencement of efficient manufacturing operations, and, ultimately, the acceptance of the products by retail customers. While we expect the expansion to be successful, should we encounter difficulties involving these or similar factors, it may not be as successful as we anticipate.\nBrexit and political uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the European Union could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our performance.\nWe have significant operations in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020, known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d with an effective date of December 31, 2020. While the United Kingdom and the European Union have agreed that there will be no taxes on goods or limits on the amount that can be traded between the two parties, new documentation requirements, safety checks and customs declarations will be required with potential shipment delays to conduct additional measures. New procedures at ports and new documentation requirements could lead to disruptions in trade.\nChanges in the British regulatory environment likely will increase our compliance costs. We may find it more difficult to conduct business in the United Kingdom and the European Union, as Brexit likely will result in increased regulatory complexity and increased restrictions and costs on the movement of capital, goods and personnel. We may decide to relocate or otherwise alter certain of our European or United Kingdom operations to respond to the new business, legal, regulatory, tax and trade environments. Brexit may adversely affect our relationships with our dealers and their retail customers, suppliers and employees and our performance could be materially adversely affected.\nThere could be a risk that other countries may leave the European Union, leaving uncertainty regarding debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, as well as uncertainty over the long-term stability of the Euro as a single common currency. These uncertainties and implications could materially adversely impact the financial markets in Europe and globally, as well as our customers, suppliers and lenders.\nManufacturing and Operations\nOur success depends on the introduction of new products, which requires substantial expenditures.\nOur long-term results depend upon our ability to introduce and market new products successfully. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022innovation;\n\u2022customer acceptance;\n\u2022the efficiency of our suppliers in providing component parts and of our manufacturing facilities in producing final products; and\n\u2022the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors.\nAs both we and our competitors continuously introduce new products or refine versions of existing products, we cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share our new products will achieve. We have experienced delays in the introduction of new products in the past, and we may experience delays in the future. Any delays or other problems with our new product launches will adversely affect our performance. In addition, introducing new products can\nresult in decreases in revenues from our existing products. Consistent with our strategy of offering new products and product refinements, we expect to make substantial investments in product development and refinement. We may need more funding for product development and refinement than is readily available, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to deliver precision agriculture and high-tech solutions to our customers, it could materially adversely affect our performance.\nOur precision technology products include both hardware and software components that relate to guidance, telemetry, automation, autonomy and connectivity solutions. We have to be able to successfully develop and introduce new solutions that improve profitability and result in sustainable farming techniques in order to remain competitive. We expect to make significant investments in research and development expenses, acquisitions of businesses, collaborative arrangements and other sources to drive these outcomes. Such investments may not produce attractive solutions for our customers. We also may have to depend on third parties to supply certain hardware or software components or data services in our precision technology products. Our dealers ability to support such solutions also may impact our customers, acceptance and demand of such products.\nRationalization or restructuring of manufacturing facilities, and plant expansions and system upgrades at our manufacturing facilities, may cause production capacity constraints and inventory fluctuations.\nThe rationalization of our manufacturing facilities has at times resulted in, and similar rationalizations or restructurings in the future may result in, temporary constraints upon our ability to produce the quantity of products necessary to fill orders and thereby complete sales in a timely manner. In addition, system upgrades at our manufacturing facilities that impact ordering, production scheduling, manufacturing and other related processes are complex, and could impact or delay production. A prolonged delay in our ability to fill orders on a timely basis could affect customer demand for our products and increase the size of our product inventories, causing future reductions in our manufacturing schedules and adversely affecting our performance. Moreover, our continuous development and production of new products often involve the retooling of existing manufacturing facilities. This retooling may limit our production capacity at certain times in the future, which could adversely affect our performance. In addition, the expansion and reconfiguration of existing manufacturing facilities, as well as new or expanded manufacturing operations in emerging markets, such as China and Russia, could increase the risk of production delays, as well as require significant investments.\nWe depend on suppliers for components, parts and raw materials for our products, and any failure by our suppliers to provide products as needed, or by us to promptly address supplier issues, will adversely impact our ability to timely and efficiently manufacture and sell products. We also are subject to raw material price fluctuations, which can adversely affect our manufacturing costs.\nOur products include components and parts manufactured by others. As a result, our ability to timely and efficiently manufacture existing products, to introduce new products, and to shift manufacturing of products from one facility to another depends on the quality of these components and parts and the timeliness of their delivery to our facilities. At any particular time, we depend on numerous suppliers, and the failure by one or more of our suppliers to perform as needed will result in fewer products being manufactured, shipped and sold. If the quality of the components or parts provided by our suppliers is less than required and we do not recognize that failure prior to the shipment of our products, we will incur higher warranty costs. The timely supply of component parts for our products also depends on our ability to manage our relationships with suppliers, to identify and replace suppliers that fail to meet our schedules or quality standards, and to monitor the flow of components and accurately project our needs. The shift from our existing suppliers to new suppliers, including suppliers in emerging markets, also may impact the quality and efficiency of our manufacturing capabilities, as well as warranty costs.\nChanges in the availability and prices of certain raw materials, components and parts could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on the sale of our products. Changes in the availability and price of these raw materials, components and parts, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility, as well as regulatory instability or change in tariffs, can significantly increase the costs of production. This, in turn, could have a material negative effect on performance, particularly if, due to pricing considerations or other factors, we are unable to recover the increased costs through pricing from our dealers.\nWe may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire and may not fully achieve, or achieve within a reasonable time frame, expected strategic objectives and other expected benefits of the acquisitions.\nFrom time-to-time we seek to expand through acquisitions of other businesses. We expect to realize strategic and other benefits as a result of our acquisitions, including, among other things, the opportunity to extend our reach in the agricultural\nindustry and provide our dealers and their retail customers with an even wider range of products and services. However, it is impossible to predict with certainty whether, or to what extent, these benefits will be realized or whether we will be able to integrate acquired businesses in a timely and effective manner. For example:\n\u2022the costs of integrating acquired businesses and their operations may be higher than we expect and may require significant attention from our management;\n\u2022the businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities, such as environmental liabilities or liabilities for violations of laws, such as the FCPA, that we did not expect; and\n\u2022our ability to successfully carry out our growth strategies for acquired businesses often will be affected by, among other things, our ability to maintain and enhance our relationships with their existing customers, our ability to provide additional product distribution opportunities to them through our existing distribution channels, changes in the spending patterns and preferences of customers and potential customers, fluctuating economic and competitive conditions and our ability to retain their key personnel.\nOur ability to address these issues will determine the extent to which we are able to successfully integrate, develop and grow acquired businesses and to realize the expected benefits of these transactions. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our performance following the transactions.\nOur business routinely is subject to claims and legal actions, some of which could be material.\nWe routinely are a party to claims and legal actions incidental to our business. These include claims for personal injuries by users of farm equipment, disputes with distributors, vendors and others with respect to commercial matters, and disputes with taxing and other governmental authorities regarding the conduct of our business, including environmental matters. While these matters generally are not material, it is entirely possible that a matter will arise that is material to our business.\nIn addition, we use a broad range of technology in our products. We developed some of this technology, we license some of this technology from others, and some of the technology is embedded in the components and parts that we purchase from suppliers. From time-to-time, third parties make claims that the technology that we use violates their patent rights. While to date none of these claims have been significant, we cannot provide any assurances that there will not be significant claims in the future or that currently existing claims will not prove to be more significant than anticipated.\nFinancial Risks\nWe can experience substantial and sustained volatility with respect to currency exchange rates and interest rates, which can adversely affect our reported results of operations and the competitiveness of our products.\nWe conduct operations in a variety of currencies. Our production costs, profit margins and competitive position are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. We also are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we denominate sales, and to risks associated with translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into United States dollars. Similarly, changes in interest rates affect us by increasing or decreasing borrowing costs and finance income. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar in relation to the United States dollar, and the Euro in relation to the British pound. Where naturally offsetting currency positions do not occur, we attempt to manage these risks by economically hedging some, but not necessarily all, of our exposures through the use of foreign currency forward exchange or option contracts. As with all hedging instruments, there are risks associated with the use of foreign currency forward exchange or option contracts, interest rate swap agreements and other risk management contracts. While the use of such hedging instruments provides us with protection for a finite period of time from certain fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates, when we hedge we forego part or all the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates. In addition, any default by the counterparties to these transactions could adversely affect us. Despite our use of economic hedging transactions, currency exchange rate or interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our performance.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK, the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that it no longer will compel or persuade financial institutions and panel banks to make LIBOR submissions after 2021. This decision is expected to result in the end of the use of LIBOR as a reference rate for commercial loans and other indebtedness. We have both LIBOR-denominated and EURIBOR-denominated indebtedness or derivative instruments. The transition to alternatives to LIBOR could be modestly disruptive to the credit markets, and while we do not believe that the impact would be material to us, we do not have definitive insight into what the impacts might be. In the\nevent that LIBOR is no longer published, interest on our credit facility will be calculated based upon the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) or a base rate, as defined in the facility agreement, whichever we believe will be the most cost effective. Our credit facility also provides for an expedited amendment process once a replacement for LIBOR is established.\nWe have significant pension and retiree healthcare obligations with respect to our employees, and our cash flow available for other purposes may be adversely affected in the event that payments became due under any pension plans that are unfunded or underfunded. Declines in the market value of the securities used to fund these obligations will result in increased pension expense in future periods.\nA portion of our active and retired employees participate in defined benefit pension and retiree healthcare plans under which we are obligated to provide prescribed levels of benefits regardless of the value of the underlying assets, if any, of the applicable plans. To the extent that our obligations are unfunded or underfunded, we will have to use cash flow from operations and other sources to fulfill our obligations either as they become due or over some shorter funding period. In addition, since the assets that we already have provided to fund these obligations are invested in debt instruments and other securities, the value of these assets varies due to market factors. Historically, these fluctuations have been significant and sometimes adverse, and there can be no assurances that they will not be significant or adverse in the future. Similarly the amount of our obligations varies depending upon mortality assumptions, discount rates, salary growth, retirement rates and ages, inflation, changes in health care costs and similar factors. We also are subject to laws and regulations governing the administration of our plans in certain countries, and the specific provisions, benefit formulas and related interpretations of such laws, regulations and provisions can be complex. Failure to properly administer the provisions of our plans and comply with applicable laws and regulations could have an adverse impact to our results of operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had substantial unfunded or underfunded obligations related to our pension and other postretirement health care benefits. See the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d for more information regarding our unfunded or underfunded obligations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, and, as a result, we are subject to certain restrictive covenants and payment obligations that may adversely affect our ability to operate and expand our business.\nOur credit facility and certain other debt agreements have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain certain total debt to EBITDA and interest coverage ratios. In addition, the credit facility and certain other debt agreements contain other restrictive covenants, such as ones that limit the incurrence of indebtedness and the making of certain payments, including dividends, and are subject to acceleration in the event of default. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result.\nIf any event of default were to occur, our lenders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable, and our cash may become restricted. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under our credit facility or certain other debt agreements also could result in an event of default under our other financing agreements.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have other important adverse consequences such as:\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the agricultural industry;\n\u2022restricting us from being able to introduce new products or pursuing business opportunities;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, repurchase shares, pay cash dividends or engage in or enter into certain transactions.\nChanges to United States tax, tariff, trade and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nThere have been ongoing discussions and significant changes to United States trade policies, treaties, tariffs and taxes. Although the levels change from period to period, we generally have substantial imports into the United States of products and components that are either produced in our foreign locations or are purchased from foreign suppliers, and also have substantial\nexports of products and components that we manufacture in the United States. The impact of any changes to current trade, tariff or tax policies relating to imports and exports of goods is dependent on factors such as the treatment of exports as a credit to imports, and the introduction of any tariffs or taxes relating to imports from specific countries. The most significant changes have been the imposition of tariffs by the United States on imports from China and the imposition by China of tariffs on imports from the United States. These trade restrictions include withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, or tariffs on the import of agricultural commodities into China, which are critical to our customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity and protein prices or limiting the export of commodities could have a material adverse impact on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative impact on the demand for agricultural equipment across the world. Our sales could be negatively impacted by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of such equipment globally.\nIn the past, we have had moderate amounts of imports into the U.S. from China. To date, the impact of U.S. import tariffs on China-sourced equipment has not been material to us because we have been able to redirect production and employ sourcing alternatives for products previously imported into the U.S. from our China manufacturing facility. In addition, we do not export significant amounts from the United States into China. It is unclear what other changes might be considered or implemented and what response to any such changes may be by the governments of other countries. Any changes that increase the cost of international trade or otherwise impact the global economy, including through the increase in domestic prices for raw materials, could have a material adverse effect on our performance.\nWe have joint ventures in the Netherlands and Russia with an entity that currently is operating under a time-limited general license from the U.S. Department of Treasury authorizing the maintenance or wind-down of operations and existing contracts. In the event that the license expires without further relief being granted or without other authorization from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, we may no longer be able to continue the joint ventures' commercial operations, and we would be required to assess the fair value of certain assets related to the joint ventures for potential impairment. Our most recent preliminary assessment indicated that impairment, if any, would not be material.\nEnvironmental Risks\nWe are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including increasingly stringent engine emissions standards, and our compliance with, or our failure to comply with, existing or future laws and regulations could delay production of our products or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. These regulations govern, among other things, emissions into the air, discharges into water, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the prevention and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Our costs of complying with these or any other current or future environmental regulations may be significant. For example, several countries have adopted more stringent environmental regulations regarding emissions into the air, and it is possible that new emissions-related legislation or regulations will be adopted in connection with concerns regarding GHG. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to us in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs, which would increase our operating costs through higher utility and transportation expenses and costs of materials. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs also could impact retail customer operations and demand for our equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on our global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, we are unable to predict its potential impact at this time.\nWe also may be subject to liability in connection with properties and businesses that we no longer own or operate. We may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted in the future that could apply to both future and prior conduct. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, or we may not be able to sell our products and, therefore, our performance could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the products that we manufacture or sell, particularly engines, are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations, including those that limit GHG emissions. As a result, on an ongoing basis we incur significant engineering expenses and capital expenditures to modify our products to comply with these regulations. Further, we may experience production delays if we or our suppliers are unable to design and manufacture components for our products that comply with environmental standards. For instance, as we are required to meet more stringent engine emission reduction standards that are applicable to engines we manufacture or incorporate into our products, we expect to meet these requirements through the introduction of new technology to our products, engines and exhaust after-treatment systems, as necessary. Failure to meet applicable requirements could materially affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to SEC disclosure obligations relating to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (columbite-tantalite, cassiterite (tin), wolframite (tungsten) and gold) that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjacent countries. Complying with these requirements has and will require us to incur additional costs, including the costs to determine the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products and to modify our processes or products, if required. As a result, we may choose to modify the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials in our products. In addition, we may face reputational and regulatory risks if the information that we receive from our suppliers is inaccurate or inadequate, or our process for obtaining that information does not fulfill the SEC\u2019s requirements. We have a formal policy with respect to the use of conflict minerals in our products that is intended to minimize, if not eliminate, conflict minerals sourced from the covered countries to the extent that we are unable to document that they have been obtained from conflict-free sources.\nHuman Capital Risks\nOur labor force is heavily unionized, and our obligations under collective bargaining agreements and labor laws subject us to the risks of work interruption or stoppage and could cause our costs to be higher.\nMost of our employees, most notably at our manufacturing facilities, are subject to collective bargaining agreements and union contracts with terms that expire on varying dates. Several of our collective bargaining agreements and union contracts are of limited duration and, therefore, must be re-negotiated frequently. As a result, we are at greater risk of work interruptions or stoppages than non-unionized companies, and any work interruption or stoppage could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale. In addition, collective bargaining agreements, union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to streamline existing manufacturing facilities, restructure our business or otherwise reduce our labor costs because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions.\nOur ability to recruit, develop, train and retain qualified and skilled employees could impact our ability to execute strategies.\nOur success is dependent, in part, on our ability to recruit, develop, train and retain qualified employees with the relevant education, background and experience. Equally we must be able to retain such skilled employees through our efforts to develop, train, compensate and engage them. Failure to do so could impair our ability to execute our business strategies and could ultimately impact our performance.\nData Security, Privacy and Cybersecurity Risks\nOur business increasingly is subject to regulations relating to privacy and data protection, and if we violate any of those regulations we could be subject to significant claims, penalties and damages.\nIncreasingly, the United States, the European Union, Brazil and other governmental entities are imposing regulations designed to protect the collection, maintenance and transfer of personal information. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) that imposed stringent data protection requirements and greater penalties for non-compliance beginning in May 2018. The GDPR also protects a broader set of personal information than traditionally has been protected in the United States and provides for a right of \u201cerasure.\u201d Other regulations govern the collection and transfer of financial data and data security generally. These regulations generally impose penalties in the event of violations, and private lawsuits in the event of a release of personal information are common. While we attempt to comply with all applicable privacy regulations, their implementation is complex, and, if we are not successful, we may be subject to penalties and claims for damages from regulators and the impacted parties.\nCybersecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise confidential information, exposing us to liability that could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of our equipment. We also use information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy. Despite security measures\nand business continuity plans, our information technology networks and infrastructure are vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts or, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, and could disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our performance. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems.", "PERMNO": 77520, "SIC": 3523, "TIC": "AGCO"}
