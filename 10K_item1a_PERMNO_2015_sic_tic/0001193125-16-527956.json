{"cik": "1490636", "company": "Gordmans Stores, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business faces a number of risks and uncertainties, which are summarized below. While the risks and uncertainties described below are those with the most impact on our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial that may have an impact on our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon our ability to identify and respond to new and changing fashion and style trends, guest preferences and other related factors, and our inability to identify and respond to these new trends may lead to inventory markdowns and write offs, which could adversely affect our brand image and results of operations.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability to effectively identify and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer demands, and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable merchandise offerings. Although we attempt to stay abreast of the fashion tastes of our guests and provide merchandise that satisfies guest demand, fashion trends can change rapidly and we cannot assure you that we will accurately anticipate shifts in fashion trends and adjust our merchandise mix to appeal to changing consumer tastes in a timely manner. If we misjudge the market for our merchandise or are unsuccessful in responding to changes in fashion trends or in market demand, we could experience insufficient or excess inventory levels which could result in higher markdowns, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that our new merchandise offerings will have the same level of acceptance as our merchandise offerings in the past or that we will be able to adequately and timely respond to the preferences of our guests. The failure of any new merchandise offerings to appeal to our guests could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nOur sales and profitability fluctuate on a seasonal basis and are affected by weather conditions and other factors.\nOur business is affected by the seasonal pattern common to most retailers, weather conditions, consumer spending and general economic conditions. Historically, our highest net sales occur during the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. Any significant decrease in net sales during the holiday season would have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and our results of operations. In addition, in order to prepare for this season, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we carry during other parts of the year. This increase in merchandise inventory build-up in the third and fourth quarters may require us to expend cash faster than we generate by our operations during this period and to borrow on our revolving line of credit facility at higher levels. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our merchandise during this peak shopping season could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability, ability to repay any indebtedness and our brand image with guests. Given our primarily northern Midwest footprint, as well as the fact that a significant portion of our business is apparel, our business is susceptible to adverse, unseasonable or unexpected weather conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and on the timing and amount of our revenues, financial condition and cash flows by disrupting consumer shopping patterns and demand for certain seasonal merchandise, which could lead to substantial markdowns of seasonal merchandise, adversely affect the distribution of our merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and from our distribution centers to our stores, and cause physical damage to our retail stores.\nWe face intense competition in the retail industry.\nWe face substantial competition for guests from regional and national department stores, specialty stores, discount stores, mid-tier stores, off-price retail chains and \u201cpure play\u201d internet retailers. We compete on the basis of a combination of factors, including among others price, breadth, quality and style of merchandise offered, in-store experience, level of guest service, ability to identify and offer new and emerging fashion trends and brand image. Many of these competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We launched our eCommerce operations in mid-fiscal year 2015, and many of our competitors operated eCommerce platforms for a longer period of time. Accordingly, we may face periods of intense competition in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Our expansion into markets served by our competitors and entry of new competitors or expansion of existing competitors into our markets could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nOur inability to maintain or improve levels of comparable store sales could cause our stock price to decline.\nComparable store sales are an important indicator of current operating performance, with higher comparable store sales helping us to leverage our fixed expenses and positively impact our operating results. We may not be able to maintain or improve the levels of comparable store sales that we have experienced in the past.\nComparable store sales on an owned basis decreased 1.3% while comparable store sales on an owned and licensed basis decreased 1.2% in fiscal year 2015. Our annual comparable store sales on an owned basis have ranged from a decrease of 7.4% to an increase of 0.7% during the past five fiscal years. If our future comparable store sales do not increase or fail to meet market expectations, the price of our common stock could further decline or remain low. In addition, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect comparable store sales, including fashion trends, competition, current national and regional economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, store traffic and conversion rates, changes in our merchandise mix, inventory shrinkage, the success of our multi-channel marketing programs, the timing and level of markdowns and weather conditions. In addition, many retailers have been unable to sustain high levels of comparable store sales growth during and after periods of\nsubstantial expansion. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to be materially lower than in recent periods and our expectations, which could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nThe continuing industry trend of decreasing retail center traffic could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nWhile we launched our eCommerce platform in mid-fiscal year 2015, we are primarily a brick-and-mortar based retailer and are dependent upon the continued popularity of retail centers as a shopping destination and the ability of retail center anchor tenants and other attractions within the vicinity of our stores to generate customer traffic. Increased online shopping and unfavorable economic conditions, particularly in certain regions, have adversely affected retail center traffic and resulted in the closing of certain anchor tenants. Growing technology has improved the experience of online shopping and, in some cases, has resulted in a shift of consumer spending from brick-and-mortar to online where competition is even greater since \u201cpure play\u201d internet retailers do not face significant occupancy costs, store payroll, etc., like we do. In addition, volatility in the U.S. economy or an uncertain economic outlook could continue to lower consumer spending levels and cause a decrease in shopping mall traffic, each of which would adversely affect our sales and financial performance.\nOur failure to operate our eCommerce operation effectively could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe continue to enhance our eCommerce operations following its launch in mid-fiscal year 2015. We believe that our business model is right for an omni-channel approach and that eCommerce will provide further guest awareness of our wide merchandise assortment while driving incremental sales. However, if we are not successful in our eCommerce operations, meeting guest expectations and providing our merchandise assortment across all channels at the level our guests expect, our sales, profitability and results of operations, as well as brand image, could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur eCommerce operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results, including: (i) diversion of traffic and sales from our stores; (ii) liability for online content; (iii) risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate our website and its related support systems, including computer viruses, credit card fraud, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions and reliance on third party computer software and hardware; and (iv) the need to invest additional computer systems.\nOur advertising, marketing and promotional strategies may be ineffective and inefficient.\nOur profitability and results of operations may be materially impacted by the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select the right markets and media in which to advertise. In particular, we may not be successful in our efforts to create greater awareness of our stores and our promotions, identify the most effective and efficient level of spending in each market and specific media vehicle and determine the appropriate creative message and media mix for our advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures.\nWe utilize several types of advertising media, including newspaper inserts. The newspaper business is under increasing economic pressure, and the demise of certain newspapers would jeopardize an important distribution method for our advertising. As such, we will continue to allocate a greater portion of our advertising budget to television, as well as mobile, email and social as these mediums continue to grow. We continue to leverage our loyalty program, which was launched company-wide in fiscal year 2013, as a medium of advertising.\nOur planned marketing expenditures and allocation of those expenditures to the various marketing mediums we utilize may not result in increased revenues. In addition, if we are not able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis, our profitability and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe termination or non-renewal of our licensing agreements with DSW Inc. could adversely affect our business.\nOur footwear business is currently operated under a license agreement with DSW, Inc. where we receive a license fee equal to a specified percentage of net footwear revenue. The license agreement expires on February 2, 2019 and contains automatic three-year extension terms and a six month notice period to cancel prior to the renewal periods. Our total license fee income in fiscal year 2015 was $8.0 million, or approximately 3% of our gross profit. If DSW is unable or unwilling to continue to act as our licensee or supply us with our desired level of inventory, we could suffer a loss of income and guest traffic until such time as we are able to replace this license or to establish the structure to manage these businesses directly.\nFailure to execute our buying and inventory management strategies could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is dependent, to a significant degree, upon our ability to purchase fashion and brand name merchandise, and to do so at prices that are consistent with our cost leadership strategy. We must continuously seek out buying opportunities from our existing suppliers and from new sources, for which we compete with other retailers. Driving traffic to our stores and increasing comparable store sales requires continued replenishment of fresh, high quality, attractively priced merchandise in our stores. Our buying philosophy gives considerable discretion to our buyers, subjecting us to risks on the timing, pricing, quality and nature of inventory flowing to the stores. In addition, we base our purchases of inventory, in part, on sales forecasts. If our sales forecasts do not match guest demand, we may experience higher inventory levels and decreased profit margins, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to purchase merchandise could become limited by the consolidation or demise of merchandise vendors. Our ability to obtain merchandise may also depend on certain manufacturers\u2019 ability to obtain vendor financing through factoring companies, and to the extent they are unable to secure sufficient credit from those factors, we may not be able to purchase merchandise from them.\nWe have distribution facilities to support our stores and if we encounter difficulties associated with our distribution facilities or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason, we could face shortages of inventory that would have a material adverse effect on our business operations and harm our reputation.\nOur primary distribution facilities are located in Omaha, Nebraska and near Indianapolis, Indiana. Our distribution facilities support our entire business. The majority of our merchandise is shipped to the distribution facilities from our vendors, and then packaged and shipped from our distribution facilities to our stores. The success of our stores depends on their timely receipt of merchandise. The efficient flow of our merchandise requires that we have adequate capacity in our distribution facilities to support our current level of operations, and the anticipated increased levels that may follow from our growth plans. If we encounter difficulties associated with our distribution facilities or if they were to shut down for any reason, including due to fire or natural disaster, even though we have a disaster recovery and business continuity plan that provides for off-site merchandise processing capability in the event of a disruption, we could face shortages of inventory, resulting in temporary out-of-stock conditions in our stores, as well as incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing merchandise to our stores, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and harm our reputation.\nWe rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments and are subject to increased shipping costs as well as the potential inability of our third-party transportation providers to deliver on a timely basis.\nWe currently rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments, including shipments from our vendors to our distribution centers and from our distribution centers to all of our stores. Our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, wage rates (which would increase our shipping costs), labor availability, import delays, labor strikes\nand inclement weather, which may impact a shipping company\u2019s ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. As we rely upon independent third-party transportation providers, their inability to distribute merchandise to our distribution centers on a timely basis could impact the flow of merchandise through our supply chain, including from the distribution centers to our retail stores. If we change the shipping companies we use, we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries and we would incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from our current third-party transportation providers which in turn would increase our costs.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with services in connection with certain aspects of our business, and any failure by these third parties to perform their obligations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties for logistics services and information technology systems (including hosting our eCommerce website), onshore and offshore software development and support, distribution and packaging and employee benefits. Services provided by any of our third-party suppliers could be interrupted as a result of many factors, such as acts of nature or contract disputes. Any failure by a third party to provide us with contracted-for services on a timely basis or within service level expectations and performance standards could result in a disruption of our business and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur growth strategy is dependent on a number of factors, any of which could strain our resources or delay or prevent the successful penetration into new markets.\nOur growth strategy is partially dependent on opening new stores and operating them profitably. Additional factors required for the successful implementation of our new store growth strategy include, but are not limited to: obtaining desirable store locations, negotiating acceptable leases, completing projects on budget, supplying proper levels of merchandise and successfully hiring and training store managers and sales associates. In order to optimize profitability for new stores, we must secure desirable retail lease space when opening stores in new and existing markets. We must choose store sites, execute favorable real estate transactions, hire competent personnel and effectively open and operate these new stores. We historically have received developer funding for store build outs, which offset certain capital expenditures we must make to open a new store. For new stores opened in fiscal year 2015, developer funding was received for 97% of the costs incurred in completing the store build outs. If developer funding ceases to be available to us in the future or decreases, or if we experience cost overruns in completing our store build outs, opening new stores would require more capital outlay, which could adversely affect our ability to continue opening new stores.\nTo the extent we open stores in new markets, if our stores in these markets experience lower than planned net sales and operating results, this would not only adversely impact our sales and operating results but could also impact our ability to continue opening new stores in these markets and other new markets. Further, it could require increased advertising expenses in these markets or the need to relocate underperforming stores either within or outside their current location. To the extent we open new stores in markets where we have existing stores; our existing stores in those markets may experience reduced net sales. Our planned growth will also require additional infrastructure for the development, maintenance and monitoring of those stores. In addition, if our current management systems and information systems are insufficient to support this expansion, our ability to open new stores and to manage our existing stores would be adversely affected. If we fail to continue to improve our infrastructure, we may be unable to implement our new store growth strategy or maintain current levels of operating performance in our existing stores. We opened a second distribution center in fiscal year 2014 to support new store growth beyond fiscal year 2015 and more efficiently and effectively distribute merchandise to our stores.\nWe launched our eCommerce platform in mid-fiscal year 2015; however the continuing decrease in retail center traffic could also negatively impact our business and operating results.\nOur growth plans will place increased demands on our financial, operational, managerial and administrative resources. These increased demands may cause us to operate our business less efficiently, which in turn could cause deterioration in the performance of our existing stores.\nOur business depends in part on a strong brand image, and if we are not able to maintain or enhance our brand, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, we may be unable to attract sufficient numbers of guests to our stores or sell sufficient quantities of our merchandise.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand image. Our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities or adverse publicity regarding our responses to these concerns could also jeopardize our reputation. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.\nWe lease all of our store locations, our corporate headquarters and our distribution facilities. Our continued growth and success depends in part on our ability to renew leases for successful stores. There is no assurance that we will be able to re-negotiate leases at similar or favorable terms at the end of the lease, and we could be forced to move or exit a market if another favorable arrangement cannot be made. Additionally, in certain cases, we take responsibility for construction of a new store and are reimbursed for our construction costs by the landlord.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses. While we have a history of generating cash flows from operations, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, which could materially harm our business.\nIf an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under that lease. Our inability to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close could materially adversely affect us. There are no remaining lease commitments for the one store we closed in fiscal year 2015.\nWe depend on key executive management and may not be able to retain or replace these individuals or recruit additional personnel, which could harm our business.\nWe depend on the leadership and experience of our key executive management. The loss of the services of key executive management members could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace such personnel on a timely basis or without incurring increased costs, or at all. We believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. There is a high level of competition for experienced, successful personnel in the retail industry. Our inability to meet our staffing requirements in the future could impair our growth and harm our business.\nWe rely significantly on information systems and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of those systems could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nOur ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory, to ship products to our stores on a timely basis, and to operate our eCommerce platform depends significantly on our information systems. To manage the growth of our operations, personnel and real estate portfolio, we will need to continue to improve and expand our operational and financial systems, real estate management systems, transaction processing, internal controls and business processes; in doing so, we could encounter implementation issues and incur substantial additional expenses. The failure of our information systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or expanding them into new stores, or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the promptness and accuracy of our merchandise distribution, transaction processing, financial accounting and reporting, the efficiency of our operations and our ability to properly forecast earnings and cash requirements. We could be required to make significant additional expenditures to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. Such events may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we may now and in the future implement new systems to increase efficiencies and profitability including the point-of-sale and CRM implementation planned for fiscal year 2016. To manage growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve and expand our operational and financial systems, transaction processing, internal controls and business processes. When implementing or changing existing processes, we may encounter transitional issues and incur substantial additional costs associated with investments in information technology. Failure to properly implement new systems in the future could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nSystem security risk issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services, and any such disruption could harm our net sales, increase our expenses and harm our reputation.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers, or even internal users, may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties, including our guests, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. In addition, associate error, malfeasance or other errors in the storage, use or transmission of any such information could result in a disclosure to third parties outside of our network. As a result, we could incur significant expenses addressing problems created by any such inadvertent disclosure or any security breaches of our network. This risk is heightened because we collect and store guest information, including certain credit card information, and use certain guest information for marketing purposes. Retailers in particular have recently been targeted by hackers who seek to misappropriate confidential information. Any compromise of guest information could subject us to guest or government litigation and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and growth. Moreover, we could incur significant expenses or disruptions of our operations in connection with system failures or breaches. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the systems. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems, viruses and bugs, or any problems associated with the outsourced services, could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.\nThere are claims made against us from time to time that can result in litigation or regulatory proceedings which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability.\nWe face the risk of litigation and other claims against us. Litigation and other claims may arise in the ordinary course of our business and include commercial disputes, intellectual property issues, product-oriented allegations and slip and fall claims. In addition, we could face a wide variety of associate claims against us, including general discrimination, privacy, labor and employment, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) and disability claims. Any claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in regulatory proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our business, including\nthe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time and expense. Litigation and other claims and regulatory proceedings against us could result in unexpected expenses and liability, and could also materially and adversely affect our operations and our reputation.\nIn addition, we may be subject to liability if we infringe the trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties. If we were to be found liable for any such infringement, we could be required to pay substantial damages and could be subject to injunctions preventing further infringement. Such infringement claims could subject us to boycotts by our guests and harm to our reputation. In addition, any payments we are required to make and any injunctions we are required to comply with as a result of such infringement actions could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in laws, including employment laws and laws related to our merchandise, could make conducting our business more expensive or otherwise change the way we do business.\nWe are subject to numerous regulations, including labor and employment, customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. If these regulations were to change or were violated by our management, associates, vendors, buying agents or trading companies, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and hurt our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to increased regulatory compliance requirements, changes in laws could make ordinary conduct of our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. For example, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws could raise the wage requirements for certain associates, increasing our compensation costs. A minimum wage increase has been approved in a number of states in which we operate, which will increase our compensation costs, although we don\u2019t expect the increase to materially impact our results of operations. Other laws related to employee benefits and treatment of associates, including laws related to limitations on associate hours, supervisory status, leaves of absence, mandated health benefits or overtime pay, could also negatively impact us, such as by increasing compensation and benefits costs for overtime and medical expenses. Changes in tax laws could increase or decrease tax payments we are required to make, impacting the profitability of our business.\nMoreover, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs to us for certain merchandise or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. It is often difficult for us to plan and prepare for potential changes to applicable laws and future actions or payments related to such changes could be material to us.\nWe may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.\nCurrently, none of our associates are represented by a union. However, our associates have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If some, or all, of our workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our costs and adversely impact our profitability. Legislation could be enacted in the future which could have an adverse impact on our business by making it easier for workers to obtain union representation and increasing the penalties employers may incur if they engage in labor practices in violation of the National Labor Relations Act.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks or other intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.\nWe rely on certain trademark registrations and common law trademark rights to protect the distinctiveness of our brand. However, there can be no assurance that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks\nwill be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others or to prevent others from claiming that sales of our merchandise infringe, dilute or otherwise violate third party trademarks or other proprietary rights in order to block sales of our merchandise.\nLitigation may be necessary to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, to enforce these rights or to defend against claims by third parties alleging that we infringe, dilute or violate third party trademark or other intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, or whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property rights, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, if available at all, prevent us from selling certain products and/or require us to redesign or relabel our merchandise or rename our brand, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur lease obligations could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position.\nWe have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations. As of January 30, 2016, our minimum annual rental obligations under long-term operating leases for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 are $56.7 million and $55.9 million, respectively. Our lease obligations could have other important consequences and significant effects on our business. For example, our lease obligations could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our leases, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on our leases; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have fewer lease obligations.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accountings Standards Update (\u2018ASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (\u201cASU No. 2016-02\u201d). The new guidance requires lessees to recognize most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures will be enhanced to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The updated standard mandates a modified retrospective transition method with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur loan agreements may restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our operations and capital needs.\nOur loan, security and guaranty agreement relating to our revolving line of credit facility and term loan contains limitations on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestricts dividends and other upstream distributions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions;\n\u2022\nsell assets (including pursuant to sale leaseback transactions);\n\u2022\npay consulting fees, dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments (including acquisitions), loans, or advances;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nimplement changes in our lines of business.\nThis loan agreement requires us to maintain minimum excess availability under the revolving line of credit facility of at least $20 million, the calculation which now includes up to $3.0 million of unrestricted cash.\nIn 2013, we entered into a term loan requiring principal and interest payments over the term of the loan that increase the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts as due or we may have to borrow on our revolving line of credit facility to fund the principal and interest payments. This term loan was refinanced in 2015 with a loan having a 225 basis point lower interest rate with a maturity date in 2020. In addition, the interest rates applicable under the revolving line of credit facility and the senior term loan are subject to variability, which exposes us to interest rate risk and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the covenants in our loan, security and guaranty agreement related to our revolving line of credit facility and term loan, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests or finance future operations or capital needs. A failure by us or our subsidiaries to comply with the covenants under either of our loan agreements would result in an event of default under such indebtedness. The lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and exercise other remedies as set forth in the loan agreements. If any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated, it could result in cross acceleration or cross defaults under our other debt agreements and could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. In addition, upon an acceleration of any of our indebtedness, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay the accelerated indebtedness in full, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nWe may recognize impairment on long-lived assets.\nOur long-lived assets, including property and equipment, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Store assets are reviewed using factors including, but not limited to, our future operating plans and projected future cash flows. The Company had a net loss in both fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014, however continues to achieve positive operating cash flows. Failure to achieve our future operating plans or to generate sufficient levels of cash flow at our stores could result in impairment charges on long-lived assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. No such impairment charges on our long-lived assets were recorded in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares.\nIn May 2012, the Company filed a shelf registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant to which we, Sun Gordmans, LP and the other stockholders named in the registration statement can sell shares of\ncommon stock. In May 2012, we sold 40,000 shares of common stock and Sun Gordmans, LP sold 3,456,529 of its shares of common stock. In addition, Sun Gordmans, LP and the other stockholders named in the registration agreement are entitled to piggyback registration rights with respect to the registration of shares of our common stock. We, Sun Gordmans, LP or other stockholders may offer and sell shares in the future in registered public offerings. Also, subject to compliance with the federal securities laws, all of our outstanding shares may be sold on the open market following the expiration of any applicable lock-up period. By selling a large number of shares on the open market, these holders could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIn the future, we may issue additional securities in connection with a capital raise or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with a capital raise or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorization to issue undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequirement that two-thirds of our stockholders approve amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nrequirement that special meetings of our stockholders may only be called by a resolution adopted by a majority of our directors then in office;\n\u2022\nauthority of our Board of Directors to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.\nWe cannot assure you that we will pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near future.\nWe do not currently anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the near future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, our financial condition, contractual restrictions (including under our loan agreements), restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Additionally, our operating subsidiaries are currently restricted from paying cash dividends by the agreements governing their indebtedness, and we expect these restrictions to continue in the future.\nWe are a controlled company within the meaning of the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, and, as a result, we rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies.\nAs of March 25, 2016, Sun Gordmans, LP held approximately 50.2% of our common stock and total voting power and, as such, we are a controlled company under The NASDAQ Stock Market listing standards. As a controlled company, certain exemptions under The NASDAQ Stock Market listing standards exempted us from the obligation to comply with certain of the NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthat a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors, as defined under the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market;\n\u2022\nthat we have a corporate governance and nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthat we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nUntil we are required to comply with these NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards, holders of our common stock will not have the same protections of stockholders of companies that are subject to all of The NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance requirements.\nOur stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our financial operating performance or other factors.\nThere has been a public market for our common stock since August 2010. An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to implement our growth strategy. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including future sales of our common stock by significant stockholders, officers and directors, the financial projections we may provide to the public and any changes to these projections or our failure to meet these projections, and the public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or ratings downgrades by any analysts who follow our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12080, "SIC": 5600, "TIC": "GMANQ"}
