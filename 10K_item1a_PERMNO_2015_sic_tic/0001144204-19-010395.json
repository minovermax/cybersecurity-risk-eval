In addition to the various risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following risk factors should be considered. Unless otherwise expressly indicated, information with respect to discontinued operations has been excluded from the risk factor disclosures set forth below.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Industry and Our Business\nA downturn in the North American economy could adversely affect demand for automobiles that are manufactured with our products and therefore, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 97% of our revenues were derived from operations in North America. The level of demand for our products depends primarily upon the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are manufactured with our products. An economic recession can have a significant adverse effect on our business, customers, and suppliers, and can contribute to delayed and reduced purchases of automobiles, including those manufactured with our products. If the North American economy were to undergo a significant downturn, depending upon its length, duration, and severity, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nDemand for and pricing of our products is also subject to economic conditions and other factors (e.g., energy costs, fuel costs, climate change concerns, vehicle age, consumer spending and preferences, materials used in production, changing technology, etc.) present in the various markets in which our products are sold.\nWe are dependent upon large customers and specific customer programs for current and future revenues. The loss of any of these customers or programs, or the loss of market share by these customers or programs, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur customers are major vehicle manufacturers. During 2018, our largest volume customers, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, Nissan, Toyota, and BMW accounted for 47%, 22%, 12%, 8%, and 5% of our revenues, respectively. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of our large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows by reducing cash flows and limiting our ability to spread our fixed costs over a larger revenue base. A variety of reasons could lead to a reduction of sales to our customers, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nloss of awarded business;\n\u2022\nreduced or delayed customer requirements;\n\u2022\nOEMs\u2019 choosing to insource business that has been traditionally outsourced to us;\n\u2022\nstrikes or other work stoppages affecting customer production; or\n\u2022\nreduced demand for our customers\u2019 products.\nWe may be unable to realize revenues represented by our awarded business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe realization of future revenues from awarded business is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that our customers will actually produce, the timing of that production, and the mix of options that our customers may choose.\nIn addition to not having a commitment from our customers regarding the minimum number of products they must purchase from us if we obtain awarded business, the terms and conditions of the agreements with our customers typically provide that they have the contractual right to unilaterally terminate our contracts with them without notice or with only limited notice. If such contracts are terminated by our customers, our ability to obtain compensation from our customers for such termination is generally limited to the direct out-of-pocket costs that we incurred for raw materials and work-in-progress, and in certain instances, un-depreciated capital expenditures.\nWe base a substantial part of our planning on the anticipated lifetime revenues of particular products. We calculate the lifetime revenues of a product by multiplying our expected price for a product by the forecasted production volume for that product during the length of time we expect the related vehicle to be in production. In addition to applying our experienced judgment to customer projections, we use IHS, a third-party forecasting service, to provide long-term forecasts, which allow us to determine how long a vehicle is expected to be in production. If we over-estimate the production units or if a customer reduces its level of anticipated purchases of a particular platform as a result of reduced demand, our actual revenues for that platform may be substantially less than the lifetime revenues we had anticipated for that platform.\nTypically, it takes two to three years from the time a manufacturer awards a program until the program is launched and production begins. In many cases, we must commit substantial resources in preparation for production under awarded customer business well in advance of the customer\u2019s production start date. We cannot provide assurance that our results of operations will not be materially adversely affected in the future if we are unable to recover these types of pre-production costs related to our customers\u2019 cancellation of awarded business or if projected volumes are not attained.\nThe automobile industry is highly cyclical and a downturn would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business is directly related to the volume of automotive production. Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, consumer preferences, patterns of consumer spending, fuel costs, and the automobile replacement cycle. Automotive production and sales may fluctuate significantly from year-to-year and such fluctuations may give rise to changes in demand for our products. Because we have significant fixed production costs, declines in our customers\u2019 production levels can have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe highly cyclical nature of the automotive industry presents a risk that is outside our control and that cannot be accurately predicted. Moreover, a number of factors that we cannot reasonably predict could affect cyclicality in the automotive industry, and have affected cyclicality in the past. Decreases in demand for automobiles generally, or decreases in demand for our products in particular, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAny acquisitions or divestitures we make could disrupt our business and materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may, from time to time, consider certain acquisitions or divestitures. Acquisitions and divestitures involve numerous risks, including identifying attractive target acquisitions, undisclosed risks affecting the target, difficulties integrating acquired businesses, the assumption of unknown liabilities, potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with current customers and suppliers, the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and decreased geographic or customer diversification.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, our subsidiaries Tower Automotive Holdings III Cooperatie U.A. and Tower Automotive Holdings USA, LLC entered into a Memorandum of Understanding and Stock Purchase Agreement with Financi\u00e8re SNOP Dunois S.A. (the \u201cPurchaser\u201d). Pursuant to these agreements, the Purchaser will acquire all of the stock of TA Holdings Europe B.V., our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, and an intercompany loan, for a purchase price of\u2009 \u20ac255 million on a cash free, debt free basis, subject to working capital and other customary adjustments and a reduction to the extent that capital expenditures for our European operations for calendar year 2018 were less than \u20ac45 million. Approval of the transaction is subject to (i) the approval of the European Commission and (ii) the absence of a material breach in any of the seller parties\u2019 fundamental representations (e.g., title, authority and absence of insolvency). On February 13, 2019, we obtained the required approvals from the European Commission. During the first quarter of 2019, we expect to consummate the transaction and receive net sale proceeds of approximately $250 million after payment of transaction costs and the repayment of our cross currency swap.\nPursuant to the agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries have made customary representations to the Purchaser, including representations regarding general corporate matters, due authorization, absence of\ninsolvency, financial statements and other financial matters, compliance with law, employment matters, real property, litigation, taxes, material contracts and environmental matters. The agreement provides for indemnification by the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to its representations, subject, in general, to customary minimum and maximum thresholds. However, with respect to the environmental representations, the agreement provides for a layering of responsibilities over the applicable minimum threshold: (i) the Purchaser and Tower Automotive Holdings III Cooperatie U.A. will share in the first \u20ac5 million of damages, (ii) for damages between \u20ac5 million and \u20ac10 million, Tower Automotive Holdings III Cooperatie U.A. will have exclusive responsibility and (iii) for damages in excess of\u2009 \u20ac10 million, the Purchaser will have exclusive responsibility.\nWe cannot provide assurance that the sale of our European operations will be consummated or, if consummated, that the closing will occur on schedule. We also cannot provide assurances that any acquisitions will perform as planned or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we undertake. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that any acquisitions or divestitures will prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow, or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we undertake. Any such failure could seriously harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Trump Administration could make substantial changes to regulatory, fiscal, trade, and other policies that could adversely affect our business.\nThe Trump Administration has called for substantial changes to regulatory, fiscal and other policies, which may include significant changes to trade agreements currently in effect. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business. However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business. It is likely that some policies adopted by the Administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Until we know what new changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by such changes.\nDeterioration in the United States and world economies could adversely affect our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to access the capital markets, which may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe capital and credit markets provide companies with liquidity to help operate and grow their businesses, beyond that which is provided by operating cash flows. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our customers by making it increasingly difficult for them to obtain financing for their businesses and for their customers to obtain financing for automobile purchases. Our OEM customers typically require significant financing for their respective businesses. In addition, our OEM customers typically have related finance companies that provide financing to their dealers and customers. These finance companies have historically been active participants in the securitization markets, which have experienced severe disruptions during global economic crises. Our suppliers, as well as the other suppliers to our customers, may face similar difficulties in obtaining financing for their businesses. If capital is not available to our customers or suppliers, or if the cost of capital is prohibitively high, their businesses would be adversely affected, which could result in their restructuring or even reorganization or liquidation under applicable bankruptcy laws. Any such adverse effect on our customers or suppliers could materially and adversely affect our Company, either through loss of revenues from any of our customers so affected, or due to our inability to meet our commitments without excess expense, as a result of disruptions in supply caused by the suppliers so affected.\nFinancial difficulties experienced by any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on us if such customer were unable to pay for the products we provide or if we experienced a loss of, or material reduction in, business from such customer. As a result of such difficulties, we could experience lost revenues, significant write-offs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges, or additional restructurings beyond the steps we have taken to date.\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is underfunded and requires annual cash payments. If the performance of the assets in our pension plan does not meet our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our required contributions may be higher than we expect.\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is underfunded. While this plan is frozen as benefit accruals under the plan have ceased, the plan will require annual cash payments in order to meet our funding obligations, which adversely affects our cash flow.\nAdditionally, our earnings may be affected by the amount of income or expense recorded for our pension plan. GAAP requires that income or expense of a pension plan be calculated at the annual measurement date using actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the capital markets, interest rates, and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change these assumptions. These assumptions, along with the actual value of assets at the measurement date, will impact the calculation of pension expense for the year. Although GAAP expense and pension contributions are not directly related, the key economic indicators that affect GAAP expense also affect the amount of cash that we would contribute to our pension plan. The investment portfolio of the pension plan has experienced volatility. Because the values of these pension plan assets have fluctuated, and will fluctuate in response to changing market conditions, the amount of gains or losses that will be recognized in subsequent periods, the impact on the funded status of the pension plan, and the future minimum required contributions, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe decreasing number of automotive parts suppliers and pricing pressures from our automotive customers could make it more difficult for us to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry.\nThe automotive parts industry is highly competitive and bankruptcies and consolidation among automotive parts suppliers are reducing the number of competitors and resulting in larger competitors who benefit from purchasing and distribution economies of scale. Our inability to compete with these larger suppliers in the future could result in a reduction of, or inability to increase, revenues, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAlthough the overall number of competitors is decreasing due to ongoing industry consolidation, we face significant competition within each of our major product areas. The principal competitive factors include quality, global presence, service, cost, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, and timely delivery. We also face significant competitive pricing pressures from our automotive customers. Because of their purchasing size, our automotive customers can influence market participants to compete on price terms. If we are not able to offset pricing reductions resulting from these pressures by improving operating efficiencies and reducing expenditures, those pricing reductions may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry or that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDisruptions in the automotive supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAutomotive industry conditions could adversely affect the original equipment supply base. The automotive supply chain is subject to disruptions because, among other things, we, along with our customers and suppliers, attempt to maintain low inventory levels.\nDisruptions could result from a multitude of potential problems, such as the closure of one of our or our suppliers\u2019 plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions, or political upheaval. Disruptions could also result from logistical complications due to weather, earthquakes, or other natural or nuclear disasters, mechanical failures, technology disruptions, or delayed customs processing.\nIf we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all or a substantial portion of its losses and expenses from us. Any disruptions affecting us or caused by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe volatility of steel prices may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe utilize steel and various purchased steel products in virtually all of our products. We refer to the \u201cnet steel impact\u201d as the combination of the change in steel prices that are reflected in the price of our products, the change in the cost to procure steel from mills, and the change in our recovery of scrap steel (which we refer to as \u201coffal\u201d). Our strategy is to be economically neutral to steel pricing by having these factors offset each other. While we strive to achieve a neutral net steel impact, we are not always successful in achieving that goal, in large part due to timing differences. The timing of a change in the price for steel may occur in separate periods and if a change occurs, that change may have a disproportionate effect on our liquidity because of the time difference between our payment for steel and our collection of cash from customers. We tend to pay for replacement materials, which are more expensive when steel prices are rising, over a much shorter period. As a result, rising steel prices may cause us to draw greater than anticipated amounts from our credit lines to cover the cash flow cycle from our steel purchases to cash collection for related accounts receivable. This cash requirement for working capital is higher in periods when we are increasing our inventory quantities.\nA by-product of our production process is the generation of offal. We typically sell offal in secondary markets, which are similar to the steel markets. We generally share our recoveries from sales of offal with our customers either through scrap sharing agreements, in cases in which we are participating in resale programs, or through product pricing, in cases in which we purchase steel directly from steel mills. In either situation, we may be affected by the fluctuation in scrap steel prices, either positively or negatively, in relation to our various customer agreements. As offal prices generally increase and decrease as steel prices increase and decrease, our sale of offal may mitigate the impact of the volatility of steel price increases, as well as limit the benefits reaped from steel price declines. Any volatility in offal and steel prices could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries.\nOur international operations include manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 6% of our revenues were derived from operations outside the United States. Our international operations are subject to various risks such as exposure to local economic and political conditions, local tax requirements and obligations, legal and regulatory concerns, controls on the repatriation of cash, and labor disruptions or operational shutdowns. The occurrence of any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations and our business as a whole. In addition, the economic instability in Mexico and Brazil could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as adversely affect our access to, and cost of, capital.\nThe inability for us, our customers, or our suppliers to obtain and maintain sufficient credit insurance or capital financing, including working capital lines, may adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of us, our customers, and our suppliers.\nOur working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending, in part, on the level, variability and timing of our customers\u2019 vehicle production and the payment terms we have with our customers and suppliers. Our liquidity could also be adversely affected if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or payment on delivery. If our available cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we would be required to look to our cash balances and borrowing availability under our credit facilities to satisfy those needs, as well as look to potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts, if at all.\nThere can be no assurance that we, our customers, or our suppliers will continue to have the ability to maintain sufficient capital financing. This may increase the risk of not being able to produce our products or having to pay higher prices for our inputs that may not be recovered in our selling prices. Our suppliers often seek to obtain credit insurance based on our consolidated financial condition and strength, which may be less robust. If we were to experience liquidity issues, our suppliers may not be able to obtain credit insurance and, in turn, would likely not be able to offer us payment terms that we have historically received, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nWe may incur costs of a material nature related to plant closings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we must close manufacturing locations because of lost business or consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the employee termination costs, asset retirements, and other exit costs associated with the closure of these facilities may be significant. In certain circumstances, we may close a manufacturing facility that is operated under a lease agreement and we may continue to incur material costs in accordance with the lease agreement. We attempt to align production capacity with demand; however, we cannot provide assurance that plants will not have to be closed.\nWe are subject to environmental risks and requirements and we may incur significant costs, liabilities, and obligations associated with those risks and requirements.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws, regulations, and permits that govern, among other things, soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal, and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of materials, including GHGs, into the environment; and health and safety. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or become subject to litigation. Environmental and pollution control laws, regulations, and permits, and the enforcement thereof, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time, and may necessitate substantial capital expenditures or operating costs.\nUnder certain environmental requirements, we could be responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our, or the Predecessor Company\u2019s, currently or formerly owned or operated properties or third-party waste-disposal sites, even if we were not at fault. Soil and groundwater contamination is being addressed at certain of these locations. In addition to potentially significant investigation and cleanup costs, contamination can give rise to third-party claims for fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury, or property damage.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our costs, liabilities, and obligations relating to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA disruption in our information technology systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology systems. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our systems could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, natural or man-made incidents or disasters or unauthorized physical or electronic access. A breach could result in business disruption, theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information and unauthorized access to personnel information. To the extent that our business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could materially and adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial health and our ability to fund our operations, obtain financing in the future, and react to changes in our business.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our total debt, net of debt issue costs, was $298.6 million. That indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect our stock price;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our financing arrangements;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings have, and will continue to have, variable interest rates;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to financial and restrictive covenants included in our debt agreements; and\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing.\nOur primary debt instrument is the Term Loan Credit Facility which bears interest at (i) the Alternate Base Rate plus a margin of 1.75% or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (calculated by multiplying the applicable LIBOR by a statutory reserve rate, with a floor of 1.00%) plus a margin of 2.75%. As of December 31, 2018, the balance on the term loan was $303.5 million (net of a $1.7 million discount). If the LIBOR rates increase in excess of 1%, we will incur higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. While we periodically enter into agreements designed to limit our exposure to higher interest rates, any such agreements do not offer complete protection from this risk.\nWe may not be able to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance, extend the maturity of, or otherwise amend the terms of our existing indebtedness, or that any refinancing, extension, or amendment will be on commercially reasonable terms. The indebtedness issued in any refinancing of our existing indebtedness could have a significantly higher rate of interest and greater costs than our existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the financial terms or covenants of any new credit facility or other indebtedness issued to refinance our existing indebtedness will be the same or as favorable as those under our existing indebtedness.\nOur ability to complete a refinancing of our existing indebtedness prior to their respective maturities is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control. For example, if a disruption in the financial markets were to occur at the time that we intended to refinance this indebtedness, we might be restricted in our ability to access the financial markets. Also, if we were unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as:\n\u2022\nsales of assets;\n\u2022\nsales of equity; or\n\u2022\nnegotiations with lenders and their respective agents to restructure the applicable debt.\nOur debt instruments may restrict, and market or business conditions may limit, our ability to employ some of our options.\nIn addition, under our credit agreements, a change in control may lead the lenders to exercise remedies such as acceleration of the loan, termination of their obligations to fund additional advances and collection against the collateral securing such loan.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, certain of which have short-term maturities, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, as well as financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay or refinance our indebtedness.\nOur debt instruments restrict our current and future operations.\nThe financing agreements governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt, incur liens, or issue certain equity;\n\u2022\ndeclare or make distributions to our stockholders, repurchase equity, or prepay certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans or certain investments;\n\u2022\nmake certain acquisitions of equity or assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022\nuse the proceeds from sales of assets and stock;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into restrictive agreements;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nchange our fiscal year;\n\u2022\namend or modify organizational documents; and\n\u2022\nengage in businesses other than the businesses we currently conduct.\nIn addition to the restrictions and covenants listed above, certain of our financing documents require us, under certain circumstances, to comply with specified financial maintenance covenants. Any of these restrictions or covenants could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet certain capital needs and could otherwise restrict our corporate activities.\nSubstantially all of our subsidiaries\u2019 assets are pledged as collateral under our secured financing arrangements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $298.6 million (net of a $1.7 million discount and $6 million of debt issue costs) of secured debt. Substantially all of our subsidiaries\u2019 assets are pledged as collateral for our borrowings under our secured financing arrangements. Most of our domestic subsidiaries are either primary obligors or guarantors under a secured financing arrangement. Substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries\u2019 assets are pledged as collateral for these obligations. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, the agent or the lenders, as applicable, would have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to secure the indebtedness and may sell the assets pledged as collateral in order to repay those borrowings, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may be volatile due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition or annual or quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in investors\u2019 or financial analysts\u2019 perception of our business risks or condition of our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or our failure to meet, earnings estimates or other performance expectations of investors or financial analysts;\n\u2022\nunfavorable commentary or downgrades of our stock by equity research analysts;\n\u2022\nour success or failure in implementing our growth plans;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of companies viewed as similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges or proposed changes in governmental regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u2022\nvolume of our common stock trading in the market;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nthe granting or exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards.\nBroad market fluctuations may result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock and you may not be able to sell your shares at prices you deem acceptable. In the past, following periods of volatility in the equity markets, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against public companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management attention.\nShares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 350,000,000 shares of common stock and as of February 19, 2019 we had 20,611,952 shares of common stock outstanding.", "PERMNO": 12340, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "TOWR"}
