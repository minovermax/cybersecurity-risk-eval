If any of the risks discussed in this annual report on Form 10-K occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly and you could lose part or all of your investment. Some statements in this annual report, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the initial section of this annual report entitled \"Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business has experienced material disruption as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and could be materially and adversely disrupted by another pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of infectious disease, or similar public health threat, or fear of such an event, in the United States or elsewhere, and the measures implemented to address such an event by government agencies and authorities.\nA pandemic, epidemic or similar serious public health issue, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, and the measures taken by international, federal, state and local governments, and other authorities to address it, could significantly disrupt our business for an extended period. Further, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets, resulting in an economic downturn. As a result, consumer confidence may wane and demand for our homes may decline having a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures. On March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency concerning the outbreak, and most states and municipalities similarly declared public health emergencies including the states in which we operate, California and Arizona. Along with these declarations, California and Arizona have enacted, at various times, \u201dstay-at-home\u201d, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and other restrictive orders to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 that substantially restricted daily activities for individuals and many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations.\nWhen under a \u201cstay-at-home\u201d or similar order, our model homes and design studios were closed to the public and operated on an appointment-only basis, as permitted, following recommended distancing and other health and safety protocols when meeting in person with a customer. Associates at our corporate and divisional offices moved to a work-from-home model for nearly all employees. Construction activities at our job sites within most of the jurisdictions in which we operate were permitted to continue, however, careful protocols were set in place to protect our employees and trade partners that impact operational efficiency. The restrictions also reduce the availability, capacity and efficiency of municipal and private services necessary to our operations which has previously and may in the future delay the delivery of our homes at certain communities.\nWhile COVID-19 infection rates improved starting in early summer of 2020 and state and local governments began relaxing the public health restrictions, we took gradual steps to resume nearly all of our operations (with enhanced safety measures). However, throughout the second half of the year and continuing into 2021, the markets in which we operate experienced several spikes in COVID-19 cases which caused us to reintroduce more restrictive protocols from time to time throughout 2020 and continuing into 2021. The United States continues to struggle with rolling outbreaks of the virus. Accordingly, there is no assurance to what level of activity our operations may continue to operate and we cannot predict the magnitude of either the near-term or long-term effects that the pandemic will have on our business.\nOur business can be negatively impacted as a result of a number of additional factors influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of an unwillingness of customers to visit model homes or employees to return to work due to fears about illness, school closures or other concerns; disruptions to the supply chain for building materials; disruptions in the mortgage financing markets; illness of key executives; inefficiencies due to safety protocols and social distancing, as well as due to the need to change protocols frequently due to the surges and reductions in COVID-19 cases; and costs incurred to disinfect contaminated employee work spaces, model homes or construction work sites.\nWe are uncertain of the potential full magnitude or duration of the business and economic impacts from the unprecedented public health effort to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19, which could include, among other things, significant volatility in financial markets and a sharp decrease in the value of equity securities, including our common stock. In addition, we can provide no assurance as to whether the COVID-19 public health effort will be intensified to such an extent that we will no longer be designated an essential business or that we will not be able to conduct any business operations in certain of our served markets or at all for an indefinite period.\nOur business could also be negatively impacted over the medium-to-longer term if the disruptions related to COVID-19 decrease consumer confidence generally or with respect to purchasing a home; cause civil or political unrest, similar to what arose during the Summer of 2020 related to efforts to institute law enforcement and other social and political reforms and which may also affect our business in the short and/or medium-to-longer term; negatively impact mortgage availability or the federal government\u2019s mortgage loan-related programs; or precipitate a prolonged economic downturn and/or an extended rise in unemployment or tempering of wage growth, any of which could lower demand for our products as occurred during the latter part of the 2020 first quarter and earlier months of the 2020 second quarter; impair our ability to sell and build homes in a typical manner, or at all, generate revenues and cash flows, and/or access capital or lending markets (or significantly increase the costs of doing so), as may be necessary to sustain our business; increase our use of sales incentives and concessions which could adversely affect our margins; increase the costs or decrease the supply of building materials or the availability of subcontractors and other talent, including as a result of infections or medically necessary or recommended self-quarantining, or governmental mandates to direct production activities to support public health efforts; and/or result in our recognizing charges in current and future periods, which may be material, for inventory impairments or land option contract abandonments, or both, related to our current inventory assets. Specifically, if conditions in the overall housing market or in a specific market worsen in the future beyond our current expectations, if future changes in our business strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our projections of future cash flows, or if there are material changes in any of the other items we consider in assessing recoverability, we may recognize charges in future periods for inventory impairments related to our current inventory assets. For example, during the 2020 first quarter, we decided to terminate our option contract for a luxury condominium project in Scottsdale, Arizona in large part due to significant economic uncertainty related to COVID-19 and recorded an abandonment charge of $14.0 million related to the capitalized costs that had accumulated to the portion of the project that was abandoned. Circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic relief measures were considered in our 2020 second quarter decision to exit our joint venture in Folsom, California which resulted in a $20.0 million other-than-temporary impairment charge for the period. Any sustained or prolonged reductions in future earnings periods may change our conclusions on whether we are more likely than not to realize portions of our deferred tax assets.\nShould the adverse impacts described above (or others that are currently unknown) occur, whether individually or collectively, we would expect to experience, among other things, decreases in our net orders, homes delivered, average selling prices, revenues and profitability, as we did in the 2020 second quarter, and such impacts could be material to our financial statements in 2021 and beyond. In addition, should the COVID-19 public health effort intensify to such an extent that we cannot operate in most or all of our served markets, we could generate few or no orders and deliver few, if any, homes during the applicable period, which could be prolonged. Along with a potential increase in cancellations of home purchase contracts, if there are prolonged government restrictions on our business and our customers, and/or an extended economic recession, we could be unable to produce revenues and cash flows sufficient to conduct our business; meet the terms of our covenants and other requirements under our unsecured Credit Facility or our Senior Notes. Such a circumstance could, among other things, exhaust our available liquidity (and ability to access liquidity sources) and/or trigger an acceleration to pay a significant portion or all of our then-outstanding debt obligations, which we may be unable to do.\nIn addition to the risks described above, the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening other risks disclosed in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, but not limited to, risks related to deterioration in homebuilding and general economic conditions, our geographic concentration, competition, availability of mortgage financing, inventory risks and impairments, supply and/or labor shortages, access to capital markets (including the debt and secondary mortgage markets), compliance with the terms of our indebtedness, potential downgrades of credit ratings, and our leverage.\nOur geographic concentration may materially and adversely affect us if demand for housing or the availability of land parcels in our current markets declines.\nOur current business involves the design, construction and sale of innovative single-family detached and attached homes in planned communities in major metropolitan areas in Southern California, metro Sacramento, the San Francisco Bay area and the greater Phoenix area. Because our operations are concentrated in these areas, a prolonged economic downturn affecting one or more of these areas, or affecting any sector of employment on which the residents of such area are dependent, or significant volatility in home prices and affordability could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and a disproportionately greater impact on us than other homebuilders with more diversified operations. During the downturn from 2007 to 2011, land values, the demand for new homes and home prices declined substantially in California. During the second half of fiscal 2018, demand for new homes, particularly in California, slowed which we believe stemmed from affordability concerns due to higher absolute home prices and higher interest rates. Buyer demand and order activity improved somewhat during 2019, which activity was unexpectedly halted in early 2020 in connection with the onset of COVID-19. While demand has since resurged, there is no assurance that order activity will continue to improve. As a homebuilder, we are often subject to market forces beyond our control. In general, housing demand is impacted by the affordability of housing. Many homebuyers need to sell their existing homes in order to purchase a new home from us, and a weakness in the home resale market could adversely affect that ability. If land values decrease or demand for new homes and home prices decline in California or Arizona, our sales, results of operations, financial condition and business would be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, our ability to acquire land parcels for new single-family homes may be adversely affected by changes in the general availability of land parcels, the willingness of land sellers to sell land parcels at reasonable prices, competition for available land parcels, availability of financing to acquire land parcels, zoning and other market conditions. Our future growth depends upon our ability to successfully identify and acquire attractive land parcels for development of our single-family homes at reasonable prices and with terms that meet our underwriting criteria. We currently depend primarily on the California markets and availability of land parcels in our California markets at reasonable prices is limited. When the supply of land parcels appropriate for development of single-family homes is limited because of these factors, or for any other reason, our ability to grow is significantly limited. To the extent that we are unable to purchase land parcels timely or enter into new contracts for the purchase of land parcels at reasonable prices, our home sales revenue and results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nMortgage financing, interest rate increases, changes in federal lending programs or other regulations, and tax law changes could lower demand for or impact homebuyers\u2019 ability to purchase our homes, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nA substantial percentage of purchasers of our homes finance their acquisitions with mortgage financing. Mortgage interest rates have remained low compared to most historical periods for the last several years, which has made the homes we sell more affordable. Mortgage rates have continuously fallen in fiscal years 2019 and 2020 due in part to Federal Reserve interest rate reductions, decelerating economic growth and other factors. However, we cannot predict whether interest rates will continue to fall or remain low or rise. Increases in interest rates increase the costs of owning a home and could adversely affect the purchasing power of consumers and lower demand for the homes we sell, which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe availability of mortgage financing is significantly influenced by governmental entities such as the FHA, VA, and Government National Mortgage Association and government-sponsored enterprises known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If these or other lenders\u2019 borrowing standards are tightened and/or the federal government were to reduce or eliminate these mortgage loan programs (including due to any failure of lawmakers to agree on a budget or appropriation legislation to fund relevant programs or operations), it would likely make it more difficult for our customers to obtain acceptable financing, which would, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, FHA and VA may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards, raise minimum down payment requirements, impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs, or limit the number of mortgages it insures. FHA and VA also limit the number of FHA or VA loans within any one community and require completion of entire buildings in which our units are located prior to allowing project approval application to be submitted, which can delay our ability to deliver completed homes in a timely manner and negatively impacting our results. Rising interest rates, decreased availability of mortgage financing or of certain mortgage programs, higher down payment requirements, increased monthly mortgage costs, and tightened credit requirements and underwriting standards, may lead to reduced demand for our homes.\nMortgage interest expense and real estate taxes represent significant costs of homeownership. Therefore, when there are changes in federal or state income tax laws that eliminate or substantially limit the income tax deductions relating to these expenses, or other increases in local real estate taxes or assessments, the after-tax costs of owning a new home can increase significantly. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, includes provisions that impose significant limitations with respect to these income tax deductions including limitations to the annual deduction for real estate property taxes and state and local income taxes as well as a limitation on the deduction for mortgage interest. We believe changes such as these adversely impact the demand for and sales prices of homes in certain markets, including parts of California, and therefore could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in general economic, real estate and other business conditions that could reduce the demand for new homes and, as a result, adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in general economic, political, real estate and other business conditions such as levels of employment, consumer confidence and income, availability of mortgage financing for homebuyers, interest rate levels, demographic trends, homebuyer preferences for specific designs or locations, real estate taxes, inflation, supply of and demand for new and existing homes, federal government actions, economic stimulus policies, tax policies and economic conditions outside the U.S. The foregoing conditions, among others, are complex and interrelated. Periods of prolonged economic downturn, high unemployment levels, increases in the rate of inflation and uncertainty in the U.S. economy, have historically contributed to decreased demand for housing, declining sales prices and increasing pricing pressure. In the event that one or more of such economic and business conditions occur, we could experience declines in the market value of our inventory and demand for our homes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nInventory risks are substantial for the homebuilding business. If the value of the land we purchase declines, we have, and may continue, to incur impairments on the carrying values of the real estate inventories we own, some of which could be significant and could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nInventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business. There are risks inherent in controlling, owning and developing land as housing inventories are illiquid assets and if housing demand declines, we may own land or homesites we acquired at costs we will not be able to recover fully, or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably. This is particularly true when entitled land becomes scarce, as it has recently, especially in the markets in which we build, and the cost of purchasing such land is relatively high. Factors such as changes in regulatory requirements and applicable laws (including in relation to building regulations, taxation and planning), political conditions, the condition of financial markets, both local and national economic conditions, the financial condition of customers, potentially adverse tax consequences, and interest and inflation rate fluctuations subject the market value of our land to uncertainty. As a result, we may have to sell homes or land for lower than anticipated profit margins or we may have to record inventory impairment charges or sell land at a loss. During 2020, we recognized $19.0 million in homebuilding inventory impairments and $22.3 other than temporary impairments related to unconsolidated joint ventures For more information on impairments, please see Notes 4 and 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. We utilize option structures to purchase land in our wholly owned business which reduces our exposure to such fluctuations, but we may still be required to take significant write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs if we elect not to exercise our options to purchase land. In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market. We regularly review the value of our land holdings and continue to review our holdings on a periodic basis for indicators of impairment. Indicators of impairment include a decrease in demand for housing due to soft market conditions, competitive pricing pressures which reduce the average sales price of homes, which includes sales incentives for home buyers, sales absorption rates below management expectations, a decrease in the value of the underlying land and a decrease in projected cash flows for a particular project. Material impairment charges, abandonment charges or other write-downs of assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to execute on our business strategies and initiatives is uncertain, and we may be unable to achieve our goals.\nWe may undertake various strategic initiatives as part of our business, such as our pivot to offer more affordable-priced homes or our potential entry into new markets. We previously focused on second move up and luxury buyers. We have invested significant efforts to align our community offerings and designs to these buyers despite our experience in catering to a different buyer profile. We can provide no assurance (i) that our strategies, and any related initiatives or actions, will be successful or that they will generate growth, earnings or returns at any particular level or within any particular time frame; (ii) that in the future we will achieve positive operational or financial results or results in any particular metric or measure equal to or better than those attained in the past; or (iii) that we will perform in any period as well as other homebuilders. The failure of any one or more of our present strategies, or any related initiatives or actions, or the failure of any adjustments that we may pursue or implement, would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to increase the value and profitability of our business; on our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course; on our overall liquidity; and on our consolidated financial statements, and the effect, in each case, could be material.\nSupply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs, delay deliveries and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe residential construction industry experiences labor and raw material shortages from time to time, including shortages in qualified tradespeople, and supplies of insulation, drywall, cement, steel and lumber. These labor and raw material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods where the regions in which we operate experience natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures. We and other homebuilders have encountered increases in costs of labor in materials, which is particularly acute in the markets in which we build in California and Arizona. In particular, in part due to the impacts of COVID-19 and also due to increasing demand, we have seen an increase in the costs and/or a decrease in the available supply of building materials, particularly with respect to lumber, and in certain cases supply chain disruptions causing delays. The cost of labor and raw materials may also increase during periods of shortage or high inflation. Pricing for labor and materials can also be affected by changes in energy prices, and various other national, regional and local economic and political factors. For example, government-imposed tariffs and trade regulations on imported building supplies have, and in the future could have, significant impacts on the cost to construct our homes. We do not have long-term contractual commitments with any subcontractors, and there can be no assurance that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available at reasonable rates and in the areas in which we conduct our operations. Certain of the subcontractors engaged by us are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining arrangements that require the payment of prevailing wages that are higher than normally expected on a residential construction site. A strike or other work stoppage involving any of our subcontractors could also make it difficult for us to retain subcontractors for our construction work. In addition, union activity could result in higher costs to retain our subcontractors. Access to qualified labor at reasonable rates may also be affected by other circumstances beyond changes in trends in labor force migration and changes in immigration laws, policies and trends. In particular, changes in federal and state immigration laws and policies, or in the enforcement of current laws and policies, may have the effect of increasing our labor costs. In addition, the enactment of federal, state or local statutes, ordinances, rules or regulations requiring the payment of prevailing wages on private residential developments would materially increase our costs of development and construction. Shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increase our costs of home construction, which we may not be able to recover by raising home prices due to market demand which puts downward pressure on our gross margins. As a result, shortages or increased costs of labor and raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively against competitors in the homebuilding industry.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other homebuilders in each market in which we operate. Additionally, there are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. We compete with numerous large national and regional homebuilding companies and with smaller local homebuilders and land developers for, among other things, home buyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled management and labor resources. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct homes that are superior or substantially similar to our products. Over the past several years, we have expanded our product offerings to include more affordably-priced homes to reach a deeper pool of qualified buyers and grow our overall community count. We believe there is more competition among homebuilding companies in more affordable product offerings than in the luxury and move-up segments. Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion and cause us to increase our selling incentives or reduce our prices. We may be at a competitive disadvantage with regard to certain of our large national and regional homebuilding competitors whose operations are more geographically diversified than ours, as these competitors may be better able to withstand any future regional downturn in the housing market. These competitors also generally have longer operating histories and greater financial and operational resources than we do, including a lower cost of capital. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors, local governments and suppliers in the markets in which we operate or in which we may operate in the future. This may give our competitors an advantage in securing materials and labor at lower prices, marketing their products and allowing their homes to be delivered to customers more quickly and at more favorable prices. We also compete with the resale, or \"previously owned,\" home market. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business could decline disproportionately to our competitors, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nInefficient or ineffective allocation of capital, including from efforts to invest in future growth or expansion of our operations or acquisitions of businesses, could adversely affect our operations and/or stockholder value if expected benefits are not realized.\nAs competition for suitable land increases, the cost of acquiring both finished and undeveloped lots and the cost of developing owned land could rise, and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline, which could adversely impact our financial results. The availability of suitable land assets could also affect the success of our land acquisition strategy and ultimately our long-term strategic goals by impacting our ability to increase the number of actively selling communities, grow our revenues and margins and achieve or maintain profitability. As a part of our business strategy, we may consider growth or expansion of our operations in our current markets or in other areas of the country. Any such growth or expansion would be accompanied by risks such as difficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies or businesses, and potential loss of key employees of the acquired business, diversion of our management team, and risks associated with entering into markets in which we have limited or no direct experience. We cannot guarantee that any expansion into a new market will be successfully executed, and our failure to do so could harm our current business. Furthermore, we may engage in other capital actions such as repurchasing our common stock or Senior Notes from time to time to reduce our indebtedness. While our goal is to allocate capital to maximize our overall long-term returns, if we do not properly allocate our capital, we may fail to produce optimal financial results and we may experience a reduction in stockholder value, including increased volatility in our stock price.\nDelays in opening communities or reductions in sales absorption levels may force us to incur additional community-level costs and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBefore a community generates any revenue, time and expenditures are required to acquire land, obtain development approvals and construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities, model homes and sales facilities. It can take several years from the time we acquire control of a property to the time we make our first home sale on the site. Our ability to process a significant number of transactions (which include, among other things, evaluating the site purchase, designing the layout of the development, sourcing materials and subcontractors and managing contractual commitments) efficiently and accurately is important to our success. Changes in law or regulation, including changes to FHA or other lending program guidelines for project approvals, local discretionary approvals, natural disasters, availability of subcontractors, errors by employees, failure to comply with regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules, failings or inadequacies in internal control processes, equipment failures or the failure of external systems, including those of our suppliers or counterparties, could result in delays and operational issues that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and our relationships with our customers. Delays in the development of communities also expose us to the risk of changes in market conditions for homes. We also incur certain overhead costs associated with our communities, such as indirect construction costs, property taxes, marketing expenses and costs associated with the upkeep and maintenance of our model and sales complexes, and interest costs. If communities are not opened within expected timeframes or our sales absorption pace decreases and the time required to close out our communities is extended, we incur additional overhead costs, interest and other carrying costs. A decline in our ability to develop and market our communities successfully within expected timeframes and to generate positive cash flow from these operations in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and on our ability to service our debt and to meet our working capital requirements.\nIncreases in our cancellation rate could have a negative impact on our home sales revenue, homebuilding margins and cash flows.\nOur backlog reflects the number and value of homes for which we have entered into a sales contract with a customer but have not yet delivered the home. Although these sales contracts typically require a cash deposit and do not make the sale contingent on the sale of the customer's existing home, in some cases a customer may cancel the contract and receive a complete or partial refund of the deposit as a result of local laws or as a matter of our business practices. Home order cancellations can result from a number of factors, including declines or slow appreciation in the market value of homes, increases in the supply of homes available to be purchased, increased competition, higher mortgage interest rates, and changes in homebuyers' financial condition or personal circumstances. In addition, as part of our strategy, we have increased the number of homes we build at more affordable price points. Our cancellation rate may increase as we sell to a more diverse credit quality of buyers. Significant cancellations have had, and could have, a material adverse effect on our business as a result of lost sales revenue and the accumulation of unsold housing inventory.\nA large proportion of our fee building revenue has been from one customer, and that customer relationship is ending.\nThe Company\u2019s fee building revenues have historically been concentrated with a small number of customers. We have several fee building agreements with Irvine Pacific, LP who accounted for 15%, 14%, and 23% of our total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In August 2020, Irvine Pacific made a decision to begin building homes using their own general contractor\u2019s license, effectively terminating the Company\u2019s fee building arrangement with Irvine Pacific moving forward. Although we are transitioning construction management responsibilities to Irvine Pacific and are not expected to be engaged for new fee building contracts with them going forward, we are currently in the process of finishing certain existing homes under construction and generating revenues in connection therewith, which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2021. The Company is actively seeking and entering into new fee building opportunities with other land developers with the objective of at least partially offsetting the expected reduction in Irvine Pacific business in future years, such as our new fee building relationship with FivePoint. See Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Fee Building.\" However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to offset the loss of the Irvine Pacific business with new opportunities and the loss of these billings could negatively impact our business and our results of operations.\nAdverse weather, including wildfires, geological conditions, and natural resource shortages may increase costs, cause project delays and reduce consumer demand for housing, all of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nAs a homebuilder and land developer, we are subject to the risks associated with numerous weather-related and geologic events, many of which are beyond our control. These weather-related and geologic events include but are not limited to droughts, floods, wildfires, landslides, soil subsidence and earthquakes. California, in particular, has experienced significant wildfire activity over the past several years. The markets in which we operate have also experienced power and resource shortages, including mandatory periods without electrical power, changes to water availability (including drought conditions) and significant increases in utility and resource costs. Shortages of natural resources, particularly water and power, may make it more difficult to obtain regulatory approval of new developments and can also increase the risk of wildfires, which may both reduce demand for housing and damage our inventory currently under construction. We can also experience significant delays due to utility company constraints which may be outside our control. For example, in January 2019, in response to potential liabilities arising from a series of catastrophic wildfires in Northern California, PG&E Corporation, a major gas and electric utility company servicing various geographic markets, including Northern California, initiated voluntary bankruptcy proceedings, which resulted in service disruptions and constraints or delays in providing such utilities in the markets in which PG&E Corporation currently operates. The occurrence of any of these events could damage our land parcels and projects, cause delays in the completion of our projects, cause us to incur additional costs, reduce consumer demand for housing and cause shortages and price increases in labor or raw materials, any of which could harm our sales and profitability. There are some risks of loss for which we may be unable to purchase insurance coverage. For example, losses associated with landslides, earthquakes and other geologic events may not be insurable. A sizeable uninsured loss could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations\nBecause of the seasonal nature of our business, our quarterly operating results fluctuate.\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate with the seasons. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in late winter and spring, although this activity also highly depends on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings and other market factors. For example, we experienced high demand during the fourth quarter of 2020, which we attribute to current market factors including low interest rates, a continued undersupply of homes, and consumers\u2019 increased focus on the importance of home amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Construction of one of our traditional homes typically proceeds after signing the agreement of sale with our customer and can require five to ten months or more to complete. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur during the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. Because of these factors, our quarterly operating results may be uneven and may be marked by lower revenues and earnings in some quarters than in others. Seasonality also requires us to finance construction activities in advance of the receipt of sales proceeds. Accordingly, there is a risk that we will invest significant amounts of capital in the acquisition and development of land and construction of homes that we do not sell at anticipated pricing levels or within anticipated time frames. If, due to market conditions, construction delays or other causes, we do not complete sales of our homes at anticipated pricing levels or within anticipated time frames, our financial performance and financial conditions could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain suitable bonding for the development of our housing projects.\nWe are often required to provide bonds to governmental authorities and others to ensure the completion of our projects. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating, financial condition, past performance and other factors, including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers. The ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities. If we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nInflation could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nInflation could adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land, raw materials and labor needed to operate our business, which in turn leads us to increase our home selling price in an effort to maintain satisfactory housing gross margins. Inflation typically also accompanies higher interest rates, which could adversely impact potential customers\u2019 ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, thereby further decreasing demand. If we are unable to raise the prices of our homes to at least partially offset the increasing costs of our operations, our margins could decrease. Inflation may also raise our costs of capital and decrease our purchasing power, making it more difficult to maintain sufficient funds to operate our business.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nBuilding sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the homebuilding industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks to those working at such sites. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for noncompliance with relevant regulatory requirements or litigation, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies, governmental authorities and local communities, and our ability to win new business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nNegative publicity or poor relations with the residents of our communities could negatively impact sales, which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.\nUnfavorable media related to our industry, company, brand, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance, or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business, regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction, and our success in maintaining and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment. Adverse publicity or negative commentary on social media outlets, such as blogs, websites or newsletters, could hurt operating results, as consumers might avoid or protest brands that receive bad press or negative reviews. In addition, residents of communities we develop may look to us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities. Efforts made by us to resolve these issues or disputes could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents, and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nWe are subject to construction defect, warranty, personal injury and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business that can be significant and could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAs a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect, product liability home warranty, personal injury and other homebuilding-related claims, arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. We expend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers. We maintain reserves to cover the resolution of our potential liabilities associated with known and anticipated warranty and construction defect related claims and litigation, but the estimation process requires us to exercise significant judgment due to the complex nature of these exposures, with each exposure often exhibiting unique circumstances and there are no assurances that such reserves will be sufficient to cover liabilities associated with warranty, product liability, and construction defect liability. We also typically act as the general contractor for the homes we build in our fee building business, including our unconsolidated joint ventures. In connection with these agreements, we indemnify the customer for liabilities arising from our work. While we maintain general liability insurance and generally seek to require our subcontractors and design professionals to indemnify us for some portion of the liabilities arising from their work, there can be no assurance that these insurance rights and indemnities will be collectible or adequate to cover any or all indemnity, construction defect and warranty claims for which we may be liable. Some claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Furthermore, most insurance policies have some level of a self-insured retention that we are required to satisfy in order to access the underlying insurance which levels can be significant. Any such claims or self-insured retentions can be costly and could result in significant liability. We may not be able to renew our insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates and may incur significant costs or expenses (including repair costs and litigation expenses) surrounding possible construction defects, product liability claims, soil subsidence or building related claims.\nAny claim that becomes litigated is inherently unpredictable. Plaintiffs may seek to consolidate multiple parties in one lawsuit or seek class action status in some of these legal proceedings with potential class sizes that vary from case to case. Consolidated and class action lawsuits can be costly to defend and, if we were to lose any consolidated or certified class action suit, it could result in substantial liability. Litigated matters, including those related to construction defects, can also result in negative publicity in traditional and social media, which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes. In addition, we conduct most of our business in California, one of the most highly regulated and litigious jurisdictions in the United States, which imposes a ten-year, strict liability tail on many construction liability claims. As a result, our potential losses and expenses due to litigation, new laws and regulations may be greater than those of our competitors who have smaller California operations as a percentage of the total enterprise.\nWe could be responsible for employment-related liabilities with respect to our contractors\u2019 employees.\nAlthough contractors are independent of the homebuilders that contract with them under normal management practices and the terms of trade contracts and subcontracts within the homebuilding industry, if regulatory agencies reclassify the employees of contractors as employees of homebuilders, homebuilders using contractors could be responsible for wage and hour labor laws, workers\u2019 compensation and other employment-related liabilities of their contractors. Even if we are not deemed joint employers with our contractors, we are, and may become in the future, subject to similar measures and legislation, such as California Labor Code Section 2810.3, that require us to share liability with our contractors for the payment of wages and the failure to secure valid workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage. In addition, California law makes direct contractors liable for wages, fringe benefits, or other benefit payments or contributions owed by a subcontractor that does not fulfill these obligations to its employees. While the Company ordinarily negotiates with its subcontractors to obtain broad indemnification rights, there is no guarantee that it will be able to recover from its subcontractors for actions brought against the Company by its subcontractors\u2019 employees or unions representing such employees and such liability could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws can negatively affect our operating results.\nIncreases in real estate taxes and other local government fees, such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools, open space, and road improvements, and/or provide low- and moderate-income housing, could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our operations. We also benefit from the availability of various deductions and tax credits. For example, in December 2019, energy tax credits were extended through 2020 and retroactively applied to properties sold after December 31, 2017. Elimination of such credits or deductions could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our net deferred tax asset and if we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code our net operating loss carryforwards would be substantially limited\nAt December 31, 2020, we had a net deferred tax asset of $15.4 million, of which $8.2 million relates to tax-effected, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from prior periods, and the remaining $7.2 million related to the timing of the recognition of various expenses which were deducted from book income but are not deductible for income tax purposes until actually paid or realized. Federal net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely; however, the loss can only be utilized to offset 80% of taxable income generated in a tax year. At December 31, 2020, the Company had no federal net operating losses as all were carried back to prior years as allowed by the Coronavirus Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\"). The Company has sizable state net operating losses totaling $87.4 million which may be carried forward 20 years in California and Arizona and will begin to expire in 2039, unless previously utilized. If we are unable to generate future sufficient taxable income, we will not be able to realize the full amount of the deferred tax asset. We regularly review our deferred tax asset for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our projections of future taxable income required to fully realize the recorded amount of the gross deferred tax asset reflect numerous assumptions about our operating businesses and investments and are subject to change as conditions change specific to our business units, investments or general economic conditions. Changes that are adverse to us could result in the need to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in a charge to income and a decrease to stockholders\u2019 equity.\nFederal and state tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d). Generally, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if the percentage of the value of the stock that is owned by one or more direct or indirect \u201cfive percent shareholders\u201d increases by more than 50% over their lowest ownership percentage at any time during an applicable testing period (typically, three years). Under Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d such corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL and tax credit carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. While no \u201cownership change\u201d has resulted in annual limitations, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an \u201cownership change.\u201d In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the consideration could result in an \u201cownership change.\u201d If an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs in the future, utilization of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. We have adopted a tax benefit preservation plan, discussed below under \u201cRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\u201d, to protect our utilization of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards, but the plan only deters, and cannot ultimately block, all transfers of common stock that might result in an ownership change.\nNew and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, or other governmental actions may increase our expenses, limit the number of homes that we can build, delay the completion of our projects, or otherwise negatively impact our operations.\nWe are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction, accessibility, anti-discrimination, and similar matters which affect the housing industry such as by imposing restrictive zoning and density requirements, which can limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area, among other things. Governmental regulation affects construction activities as well as sales activities, mortgage lending activities, and other dealings with home buyers, including anti-discrimination laws such as the Fair Housing Act and data privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations as well as due to building moratoriums or \"slow-growth\" or \"no-growth\" initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees, assessments and exactions for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects that are entitled still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health, safety, and the environment, including those regulating the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, the management of storm water runoff at construction sites, the handling, use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, impacts to wetlands and other sensitive environments, and the remediation of contamination at properties that we own or develop. The environmental regulations applicable to each community in which we operate vary greatly depending on the location of the community site, the site's environmental conditions and the present and former use of the site. Environmental regulations may cause delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation or other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity. In addition, noncompliance with these regulations could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocations or other sanctions; and contamination or other environmental conditions at or in the vicinity of our developments, whether or not we were responsible for such conditions, may result in claims against us for personal injury, property damage or other losses.\nFrom time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and other federal or state agencies review homebuilders' compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs or harm our reputation. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. Our communities in California are especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws, particularly surrounding water usage, as well as residential building codes and zoning regulations designed to counteract climate change or otherwise enhance the sustainability of the environment. Any or all of these changes could increase our costs to develop homes and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in global or regional climate conditions and legislation relating to energy and climate change could increase our costs to construct homes.\nProjected climate change may exacerbate the scarcity or presence of water and other natural resources in affected regions, which could limit, prevent or increase the costs of residential development in certain areas. There is a variety of new legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment at the federal, state and local level relating to energy, emissions and climate change. New building code requirements, including California's solar mandate that went into effect in 2020, that impose stricter energy efficiency standards have increased our cost to construct homes and legislation imposing additional efficiency standards may cause us to be unable to fully recover the costs associated with compliance. California, our largest market, enacted the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 to achieve the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, California has adopted and is expected to continue to adopt significant regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, energy-related initiatives throughout the United States may impact manufacturers of raw materials upon which we are dependent, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, which could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy-related regulations. All of the foregoing could result in increased costs to build homes and cause a reduction in our homebuilding gross margin and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with privacy laws or an information systems interruption or breach in security that releases personal identifying information or other confidential information could adversely affect us.\nPrivacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved. We use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities, to maintain our business records, and to collect and store personal identifying information, including information about employees, homebuyers, customers, vendors and suppliers as well as share information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business. The regulatory environment in California and throughout the U.S. surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. The information technology systems we use are dependent upon global communications providers, web browsers, third-party software and data storage providers and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches, cyber-attacks, ransomware attacks, significant systems failures and service outages in the past. A data security breach, a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could include the theft or release of customer, employee, vendor or company data, and could disrupt our business operations, damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, adversely impact our sales and revenue, and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals, vendors or regulators and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business. We may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures or security breaches in the future. With the outbreak of COVID-19 and the federal and state mandates implemented to control its spread, we have taken steps to allow our workforce to perform critical business functions remotely. Many of these measures were deployed for the first time and there is no guarantee the safeguards we have put in place will be completely effective or that we will not encounter some of the common risks associated with employees accessing Company data and systems remotely. We provide employee awareness training of cybersecurity threats, procure cyber insurance, and routinely utilize information technology consultants to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems. However, because methods used to obtain unauthorized access or disable systems evolve frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these attacks or to implement adequate preventative measures and we cannot eliminate the risk of such security breaches, cyber attacks, or other significant system or security failures, and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measure could be significant and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate any security breaches or incidents may not be successful.\nRisks Related to Financing and Indebtedness\nDifficulty in obtaining sufficient capital could prevent us from acquiring land for our developments or increase costs and delays in the completion of our development projects.\nOur business and results of operations depend substantially on our ability to obtain financing, whether from bank borrowings or from financing in the public debt markets. Our unsecured revolving Credit Facility, which provides for $60 million in committed borrowing capacity, matures on April 30, 2023 and our $250 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes (the \"2025 Notes\") becomes due in October 2025. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to replace existing financing or find additional sources of financing in the future on favorable terms or at all. If we are not able to obtain suitable financing at reasonable terms or replace existing debt and credit facilities when they become due or expire, our costs for borrowings will likely increase and our revenues may decrease or we could be precluded from continuing our operations at current levels. In such event, we could be required to become more reliant on other forms of financing, including joint venture relationships or securities offerings. These types of financings may restrict our flexibility, be more costly, and reduce our profitability and adversely impact our financial position. Additionally, if we cannot obtain additional financing to fund the purchase of land under our option contracts or purchase contracts, we may be forced to forfeit nonrefundable deposits or incur other contractual penalties and fees.\nOur level of indebtedness is significant and may adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations; we may incur additional debt in the future.\nThe homebuilding and land development industry is capital-intensive and requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land parcels and complete development and our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt or fund other liquidity needs. Accordingly, we incur substantial indebtedness to finance our homebuilding activities. As discussed elsewhere in this filing, including \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,\" the Company has outstanding $250 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes. As of December 31, 2020, the 2025 Notes had a carrying value of $244.9 million, net of $5.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. In addition, we have $60 million in debt commitments under our Credit Facility, none of which was outstanding or utilized to provide letters of credit at December 31, 2020 leaving $60 million available for borrowing, subject to satisfaction of the financial covenants and borrowing base requirements in the Credit Facility agreement.\nOur level of indebtedness and incurring additional debt could subject us to many risks that, if realized, would adversely affect us, including the risk that:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing as needed for working capital, land acquisition costs, building costs, other capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, or to refinance existing indebtedness before its scheduled maturity, may be limited;\n\u2022\nour debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for other purposes such as land and lot acquisition, development and construction activities;\n\u2022\nour cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal of and interest on the debt, which would likely result in acceleration of the maturity of such debt;\n\u2022\nwe may be put at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing conditions in our industry, including increased competition; and\nOur ability to meet our expenses depends, to a large extent, on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors and we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets or borrow additional funds. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced to dispose of our assets on disadvantageous terms, potentially resulting in losses. To the extent we cannot meet any future debt service obligations, we may lose some or all of our assets or property that may be pledged to secure our obligations to foreclosure. Also, debt agreements may contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. Defaults under our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with third parties - some of which are affiliated with certain of our board members - in which we have less than a controlling interest. These investments are highly illiquid and have significant risks due to, in part, a lack of sole decision-making authority and reliance on the financial condition and liquidity of our joint venture partners.\nWe own interests in various joint ventures and as of December 31, 2020, our investments in and advances to our unconsolidated joint ventures was $2.1 million. In the past, we have entered into joint ventures in order to acquire land positions, to manage our risk profile and to leverage our capital base. Although we consider all of our current joint ventures to have entered the winddown stage, we may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. These investments are generally highly illiquid and absent partner agreement, we may not be able to liquidate our joint venture investments to generate cash. We do not have exclusive control over the joint ventures which may prevent us from taking actions in our best interest but opposed by our partners which could create risk of impasses on decisions, including related to development and financing. Disputes between ourselves and our partners may result in litigation that would increase our expenses and take valuable time from our officers and directors in handling any such litigation. In addition, our Credit Facility and indenture for our Senior Notes limit our ability to make investments in joint ventures.\nWe have historically served as the managing member or general partner of our joint ventures and one of our subsidiaries acts as the general contractor while our joint venture partner serves as the capital provider. Due to our respective role in these joint ventures, we may become liable for obligations beyond our proportionate equity and/or contribution interest.\nOur unconsolidated joint ventures will frequently finance development utilizing secured financing. Secured indebtedness increases the risk of the joint venture\u2019s loss of ownership of the property (which would, in turn, impair the value of our ownership interests in the joint venture). Under credit enhancements that we may provide with respect to joint venture borrowings, we and our partners could be required to make additional unanticipated investments in and advances to these joint ventures, either in the form of capital contributions or loan repayments, to reduce such outstanding borrowings. We also often sign a completion agreement in connection with obtaining financing for our joint ventures. Under such agreements, we may be compelled to complete a project, usually with costs within the budget related to the project being funded by the lender with any budget shortfalls being borne by us, even if we no longer have an economic interest in the joint venture or the joint venture no longer has an interest in the property. A partner may fail to fund its share of required capital contributions or may become bankrupt, which may cause us and any other remaining partners to need to fulfill the obligations of the venture in order to preserve our interests and retain any benefits from the joint venture. As a result, we could be contractually required, or elect, to contribute our corporate funds to the joint venture to finance acquisition and development and/or construction costs and such ability to contribute may be limited by our corporate debt covenants.\nOur current financing arrangements contain, and our future financing arrangements likely will contain, restrictive covenants relating to our operations.\nOur current financing arrangements, including the Credit Facility and the Indenture governing the 2025 Notes (the \"Indenture\"), contain covenants (financial and otherwise) affecting our ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments, allow liquidity to fall below certain levels, make distributions to our stockholders, and otherwise affect our operating policies. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain equity interests;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, repurchase our Senior Notes, or prepay subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments, including investments in joint ventures;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\ncreate restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to transfer assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, our Credit Facility provides that our maximum net leverage ratio must be less than 60%, which, as defined in our Credit Facility agreement, is calculated on a net debt basis after a minimum liquidity threshold. Our net leverage ratio as of December 31, 2020, as calculated under our Credit Facility, was approximately 42.8%. Our Credit Facility also contains financial covenants related to our tangible net worth, liquidity, and interest coverage or a minimum unrestricted cash balance. Tables presenting our compliance with the financial conditions and covenants under the Notes and Credit Facility are set forth in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in this Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2020, we did not meet the minimum interest coverage ratio test under our Credit Facility which requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75 to 1.00 (the \u201cInterest Coverage Test\u201d). The Credit Facility provides that if the Interest Coverage Test is not satisfied on the last day of any fiscal quarter, we are required to maintain during any period in which the Interest Coverage Test is not satisfied unrestricted cash equal to not less than the trailing 12 month consolidated interest incurred (as defined in the Credit Facility agreement) which was $23.9 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with such requirement. This cash balance maintenance requirement may reduce our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes, including land investments. Failure to have sufficient borrowing base availability in the future or to be in compliance with our financial covenants under our Credit Facility could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nPotential future downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.\nRating agencies may elect in the future to downgrade our corporate credit rating or any rating of the Notes due to deterioration in our homebuilding operations, credit metrics or other earnings-based metrics, as well as our leverage or a significant decrease in our tangible net worth. These ratings and our current credit condition affect, among other things, our ability to access new capital, especially debt, as well as our stock price, and negative changes in these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt. In particular, a weakening of our financial condition, including a significant increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds, result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook, or otherwise increase our cost of borrowing.\nInterest expense on debt we incur may limit our cash available to fund our growth strategies.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding $250 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.25% 2025 Senior Notes. In addition, we have $60 million in debt commitments under our Credit Facility, of which none was outstanding or utilized to provide letters of credit at December 31, 2020 with $60 million is available for borrowing, subject to the satisfaction of the financial covenants and the state of the borrowing base and the conditions precedent to borrowing under our Credit Facility. A significant portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and therefore such cash flows are not available to make investments in our business. Our Credit Facility has, and any additional debt we subsequently incur may have, a floating rate of interest. Our Notes have a fixed rate of interest. As part of our financing strategy, we may incur a significant amount of additional debt. Higher interest rates could increase debt service requirements on our current floating rate debt and on any floating or fixed rate debt we subsequently incur, and could reduce funds available for operations, future business opportunities or other purposes. If we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to refinance our then-existing debt on unfavorable terms or liquidate one or more of our assets to repay such debt at times that may not permit realization of a favorable return on such assets and could result in a loss or lower profitability. The occurrence such events could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control triggering event as required by the Indenture.\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, we must offer to repurchase the 2025 Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the purchase date. In such circumstances, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available to repay all of our indebtedness that would become payable upon a change of control triggering event and to repurchase all of the 2025 Notes. Our failure to purchase the 2025 Notes tendered in such an offer would be a default under the Indenture and would trigger a cross default of the Credit Facility.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nWe are and will continue to be dependent on key personnel and certain members of our management team.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain key personnel including, but not limited to, our executive officers, each of whom would be difficult to replace. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers, there is no guarantee that these executives will remain employed with us. We have not obtained key person life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of death or disability of any of our key personnel. The loss of services from key personnel could materially and adversely impact our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and/or be negatively perceived in the capital markets and with our bank group.\nTermination of the employment agreements with the members of our management team could be costly and prevent a change in control of our company.\nOur employment agreements with Messrs. Webb, Miller and Stephens each provide that if their employment with us terminates under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay them significant amounts of severance compensation, thereby making it costly to terminate their employment. Furthermore, these provisions could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium paid for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders, which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur charter and bylaws could prevent a third party from acquiring us or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nProvisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with the term of one class expiring each year, which could delay a change in our control. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors to issue new series of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval. Depending on the rights and terms of any new series created, and the reaction of the market to the series, rights of existing stockholders could be negatively affected. For example, subject to applicable law, our Board of Directors could create a series of common stock or preferred stock with preferential rights to dividends or assets upon liquidation, or with superior voting rights to our existing common stock. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue these new series of common stock and preferred stock could also prevent or delay a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation contains a provision similar to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits the Company from engaging in certain business combinations with an interested stockholder (as defined in the certificate of incorporation) unless the business combination is approved in advance by a majority of the independent directors or by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding disinterested shares. The application of this provision could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us. See also \"The Company has entered into a Section 382 Rights Agreement, and if the share purchase rights issued pursuant to such agreement is exercised, it could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock\" under \"Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock.\"\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company\" and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company\" because we had public float of less than $250 million on the applicable measurement date. As a smaller reporting company, we are subject to reduced disclosure obligations in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nThe price of our Common Stock is subject to volatility and our trading volume is relatively low.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Compared to other public homebuilders, we believe we have relatively low trading volume. Because of this limited trading volume, purchases and sales of large numbers of our shares may cause rapid price swings in our stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by whether industry or securities analysts publish research and reports about us, our business, our market or our competitors and, if any analysts do publish such reports, what they publish in those reports. Any analysts who do cover us may make adverse recommendations regarding our common stock, adversely change their recommendations from time to time or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors. We are covered by a limited number of analysts. If any analyst who covers us now or may cover us in the future were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn may cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in any financing instruments, applicable legal requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, stockholders may need to sell their shares of our common stock to realize a return on investment, and may not be able to sell shares at or above the price paid for them.\nThe Company has entered into a Section 382 Rights Agreement, and if the share purchase rights issued pursuant to such agreement are exercised, it could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe entered into a Section 382 tax benefit preservation plan on May 8, 2020 with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as Rights Agent (the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d). The Rights Agreement is intended to discourage acquisitions of our common stock which could result in a cumulative \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382, thereby preserving our current ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income tax obligations, which would become subject to limitations if we were to experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined under Section 382. While this Rights Agreement is intended to preserve our current ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards, it effectively deters current and future purchasers from accumulating more than 4.95% of our common stock, which could delay or discourage takeover attempts that our stockholders may consider favorable. This limitation may impact our trading volume and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock. In addition, if the share purchase rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued, which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issued upon such exercise, or the perception that such sales may occur, could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These issuances would also cause our per share net income, if any, to decrease in future periods.\nCertain stockholders have rights to cause our Company to undertake securities offerings. Future sales of our common stock or other securities convertible into our common stock could cause the market value of our common stock to decline and could result in dilution of your shares.\nWe entered into a registration rights agreement with the individual founders and certain of our institutional shareholders, IHP Capital Partners VI, LLC, TCN/TNHC LLC and Watt/TNHC LLC at the time our Company consummated its initial public offering which gives such holders registration rights to cause our Company to undertake securities offerings. Sales by these holders, or any shareholders, in substantial amounts, could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nOur Notes and future offerings of debt securities, which rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities that may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have outstanding $250 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by conducting offerings of debt securities or additional offerings of equity securities. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities, including the Notes, and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock.\nCertain large stockholders own a significant percentage of our shares and exert significant influence over us. Their interests may not coincide with ours and may have conflicts of interests with us in the future.\nIHP Capital Partners VI, LLC (\"IHP\"), H. Lawrence Webb, Wayne Stelmar and Joseph Davis (collectively, the \"Founders\") beneficially own (as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly through their affiliates, approximately 14% of our common stock and are party to an investor rights agreement, pursuant to which each such holder agreed to vote, in respect of IHP, in favor of one individual for nomination and election to the Board chosen by IHP for so long as IHP owns 4% or more of our then-outstanding stock. IHP has also agreed to vote its shares of common stock in favor of Messrs. Webb, Stelmar or Berchtold (or, if at that time nominated as a director, Mr. Davis) in any election in which any such individual is a nominee. In addition to the influence such holders have due to their voting arrangement, to the extent they and their affiliates vote their shares together on any matter, their combined stock ownership may effectively give them the power to influence matters reserved for our shareholders, including the election of members of our board of directors and significant corporate or change of control transactions.\nCircumstances may occur in which the interest of these shareholders could be in conflict with your interests or our interests. In addition, such persons may have an interest in pursuing transactions that, in their judgment, enhance the value of their equity investment in us, even though such transactions may involve risks to you. For example, IHP is also in the real estate and land development business and may have an interest in directly or indirectly pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their other equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to us. We have entered into various business relationships with IHP, or entities affiliated with or controlled by them, including real estate development or homebuilding joint ventures. While our audit committee, our related party review committee, or in some cases all of our independent or disinterested board members, have reviewed and approved all such transactions, investment in joint ventures have considerable risks. See the Risk Factor entitled \"We currently have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with independent third parties--some which are affiliated with certain of our board members--in which we have less than a controlling interest. These investments are highly illiquid and have significant risks due to, in part, a lack of sole decision-making authority and reliance on the financial condition and liquidity of our joint venture partners\" for a description of additional risks arising from our investments in joint ventures. IHP and their affiliates are involved in business that provides equity capital for residential housing, land and development, including for businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business. In their capacities as principals or executives of those businesses, they may also pursue opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those opportunities may not be available to us.\nThere is no assurance that the existence of a stock repurchase program will result in additional repurchases of our common stock or enhance long term stockholder value, and repurchases, if any, could affect our stock price and increase its volatility and will diminish our cash reserves.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (\u201cRepurchase Program\u201d) pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to $10.0 million of shares of its common stock (the \u201cNew Repurchase Program\u201d) to replace its existing $15.0 million share repurchase program which had previously been authorized in May 2018 (the \u201cexisting program\u201d). The existing program was cancelled upon the authorization of the New Repurchase Program. Repurchases pursuant to the Repurchase Program or any other stock repurchase program we adopt in the future could affect our stock price and increase its volatility and will reduce the market liquidity for our stock. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program. Additionally, these repurchases will diminish our cash reserves and increase our leverage, which could impact our ability to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions, result in lower overall returns on our cash balances and impact our debt covenants and our ability to incur more indebtedness. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will, in fact, occur, or, if they occur, that they will enhance stockholder value. Although stock repurchase programs are intended to enhance long term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of these repurchases.", "PERMNO": 14400, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "NWHM"}
