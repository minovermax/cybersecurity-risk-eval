RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks, together with the cautionary statement under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Information\u201d above and the other information included in this report. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operation could be adversely affected.\nOur business is affected by the cyclical nature of markets we serve.\nDemand for our products tends to be cyclical and is affected by the general strength of the economies in which we sell our products, prevailing interest rates, residential and non-residential construction spending, capital expenditure allocations of our customers and other factors. While we currently expect markets to remain relatively stable in 2019, geopolitical and economic uncertainty has increased, including as a result of tariffs imposed by the U.S. and retaliatory tariffs implemented by China and other countries. If the global economy weakens, it may cause customers to continue to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of reducing their existing fleets or refurbishing or repairing existing machinery.\nOur sales depend in part upon our customers\u2019 replacement or repair cycles, which are impacted in part by historical purchase levels. In addition, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to us. If global economic conditions are weaker than our market expectations or the global economic weakness of the recent past were to recur, then there could be an adverse effect on our net sales, financial condition, profitability and/or cash flow which could result in the need for us to record impairments.\nChanges in import/export regulatory regimes, the imposition of tariffs and escalation of global trade conflicts could continue to negatively impact our business.\nThe current U.S. administration has expressed strong concerns about imports from countries that it perceives as engaging in unfair trade practices. In 2018, the U.S. Commerce Department initiated tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 which imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum and certain other foreign goods. In response, certain foreign governments, including China, have imposed and are considering imposing additional tariffs on certain U.S. goods. These actions have significantly impacted our material costs. In particular, prices for steel, a primary material in our products, rose considerably starting in the first quarter of 2018. While prices for hot rolled coil steel appear to be trending downward, steel plate prices remain elevated. In addition, tariffs on certain Chinese origin goods impact the cost of material and machines that we import directly from our manufacturing operations in China, as well as the cost of material and components imported on our behalf by suppliers. The indirect impact of the inflationary pressure on costs throughout the supply chain and the direct impact, for example, on costs for machines we import from our manufacturing operations in China, is leading to higher input costs and lower margins on certain products we sell. In addition, tariffs imposed by the Chinese government on U.S. imports have made the cost of some of our products more expensive for our Chinese customers.\nThe tariffs and the possibility of an escalation of current trade conflicts, particularly between the U.S. and China, could continue to negatively impact global trade and economic conditions in many of the regions where we do business. This could result in continued significant increases in our material and component costs and the cost of machinery imported directly from our manufacturing operations in China. In addition, it may adversely impact demand for our products in China and elsewhere. While we will seek to receive duty draw-back credits in future periods for certain products affected by Section 301 tariffs thereby mitigating a portion of the effects of Section 301 tariffs, if we are unable to recover a substantial portion of increased raw material, component or machinery costs either from duty draw-back credits or from our customers and suppliers, or if trade conflicts lead to a significant reduction in demand for our products, this could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted by the U.K.\u2019s departure from the E.U.\nUncertainty related to the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d which is currently expected to occur on March 29, 2019, could negatively impact the global economy, particularly many important European economies. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have on us, particularly for our MP segment which has significant manufacturing facilities in Northern Ireland. Depending on the terms of Brexit, we could become subject to, among other things, export tariffs and regulatory restrictions that could increase transaction costs, reduce our ability to hire or retain employees in Northern Ireland, reduce access to supplies and materials, cause shipping delays because of the need for new customs inspections and procedures and reduce demand or access to customers in international markets, all of which would impair our ability to conduct our operations as they have been conducted historically. These and other potential implications of Brexit could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding and must comply with restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\nOur total debt at December 31, 2018 was approximately $1.2 billion. Our credit agreement and other debt agreements contain financial and restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, borrow additional funds or take advantage of business opportunities. As of December 31, 2018, we are in compliance with the financial covenants. However, increases in our debt, increases in our interest expense or decreases in our earnings could cause us to fail to comply with these financial covenants. Failing to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our indebtedness or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and debt service capability.\nOur level of debt and the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our credit agreement could have important consequences on our financial position and results of operations, including increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates because debt under our credit agreement bears interest at variable rates. In addition, our credit agreement indebtedness may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing our interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or to be replaced entirely. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our credit agreement indebtedness.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on numerous factors beyond our control and our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities. Our ability to make payments on, and refinance, our debt and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. To some extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Lower sales, or uncollectible receivables, generally will reduce our cash flow.\nWe cannot assure our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\nOur access to capital markets and borrowing capacity could be limited in certain circumstances.\nOur access to capital markets to raise funds through the sale of equity or debt securities is subject to various factors, including general economic and/or financial market conditions. Significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows. If our consolidated cash flow coverage ratio is less than 2.0 to 1.0, we are subject to significant restrictions on the amount of indebtedness we can incur. Although our cash flow coverage ratio was greater than 2.0 to 1.0 at the end of 2018, there can be no assurance this will continue to occur.\nOur access to debt financing at competitive risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our credit ratings. A downgrade to our credit ratings could increase our interest rates, could limit our access to public debt markets, could limit the institutions willing to provide us credit facilities, and could make any future credit facilities or credit facility amendments more costly and/or difficult to obtain.\nAlthough we believe the banks participating in our credit facility have adequate capital and resources, we can provide no assurance that all of these banks will continue to operate as a going concern in the future. If any of the banks in our lending group were to fail or be unwilling to renew our credit facility at or prior to its expiration, it is possible that the borrowing capacity under our current or any future credit facility would be reduced. If the availability under our credit facility was reduced significantly, we could be required to obtain capital from alternate sources to finance our capital needs. Our options for addressing such capital constraints would include, but not be limited to (i) obtaining commitments from the remaining banks in the lending group or from new banks to fund increased amounts under the terms of our credit facility, or (ii) accessing the public capital markets. If it becomes necessary to access additional capital, it is possible that any such alternatives in the current market could be on terms less favorable than under our existing credit facility terms, which could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business is sensitive to government spending.\nMany of our customers depend substantially on government funding of highway construction, maintenance and other infrastructure projects. In addition, we sell products to governments and government agencies in the U.S. and other nations. Policies of governments attempting to address local deficit or structural economic issues could have a material impact on our customers and markets. Any decrease or delay in government funding of highway construction and maintenance, other infrastructure projects and overall government spending could cause our revenues and profits to decrease.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nOur industry is highly competitive. To compete successfully, our products must excel in terms of quality, reliability, productivity, price, features, ease of use, safety and comfort, and we must provide excellent customer service. The greater financial resources of certain of our competitors may put us at a competitive disadvantage. Low-cost competition from China and other developing markets could also result in decreased demand for our products. If competition in our industry intensifies or if our current competitors lower their prices for competing products, we may lose sales or be required to lower the prices we charge for our products. If we are unable to provide continued technological improvements in our equipment that meet our customers\u2019 expectations, or the industry\u2019s expectations, the demand for our equipment could be substantially adversely affected. Our ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers\u2019 anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to our success. This requires a thorough understanding of our existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in developing markets, including Brazil, China and India. Failure to compete effectively could result in lower revenues from our products and services, lower gross margins or cause us to lose market share.\nWe rely on key management.\nWe rely on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team, particularly those of the Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of key employees or senior officers, or the inability to identify, hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could adversely affect the quality and profitability of our business operations.\nSome of our customers rely on financing with third parties to purchase our products.\nWe rely on sales of our products to generate cash from operations. Significant portions of our sales are financed by third party finance companies on behalf of our customers. The availability of financing by third parties is affected by general economic conditions, credit worthiness of our customers and estimated residual value of our equipment. Deterioration in credit quality of our customers or estimated residual value of our equipment could negatively impact the ability of our customers to obtain resources they need to purchase our equipment. There can be no assurance third party finance companies will continue to extend credit to our customers.\nSome of our customers have been unable to obtain the credit they need to buy our equipment. As a result, some of our customers may need to cancel existing orders and some may be compelled to sell their equipment at less than fair value to raise cash, which could have a negative impact on residual values of our equipment. These economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to losses from providing financing and credit support to some of our customers.\nWe assist customers in their rental, leasing and acquisition of our products through TFS. We provide financing for some of our customers, primarily in the U.S., to acquire and use our equipment through loans, sales-type leases, and operating leases. TFS enters into these financing agreements with the intent either to hold the financing until maturity or to sell the financing to a third party within a short time period. Until such financing obligations are satisfied through either customer payments or a third party sale, we retain the risks associated with such customer financing. Our results could be adversely affected if such customers default on their contractual obligations to us, if residual values of such equipment on these transactions decline below original estimated values or we are unable to sell the financing receivable to a third party.\nAs described above, our customers, from time to time, may fund acquisition of our equipment through third-party finance companies. In certain instances, we may provide credit guarantees or residual value guarantees. With these guarantees, we must assess the probability of losses or non-performance in ways similar to the evaluation of accounts receivable, including consideration of a customer\u2019s payment history, leverage, availability of third party financing, political and currency exchange risks, and other factors. Many of these factors, including assessment of a customer\u2019s ability to pay, are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. We establish reserves based upon our analysis of the current quality and financial position of our customers, past payment experience and collateral values. In circumstances where we believe it is probable that a specific customer will have difficulty meeting its financial obligations, a specific reserve is recorded to recognize a liability for a guarantee we expect to pay, taking into account any amounts that we would anticipate realizing if we are forced to repossess the equipment that supports the customer\u2019s financial obligations to us. During periods of economic weakness, collateral underlying our guarantees of indebtedness of customers or receivables can decline sharply, thereby increasing our exposure to losses. In the future, we may incur losses in excess of our recorded reserves if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate further or the full amount of any anticipated proceeds from the sale of the collateral supporting our customers\u2019 financial obligations is not realized. Historically, losses related to guarantees have been immaterial; however, there can be no assurance that our historical experience with respect to guarantees will be indicative of future results.\nWe may experience losses in excess of our recorded reserves for trade receivables.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had trade receivables of $659.9 million. We evaluate the collectability of open accounts, finance receivables and note receivables based on a combination of factors and establish reserves based on our estimates of probable losses. In circumstances where we believe it is probable that a specific customer will have difficulty meeting its financial obligations, a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we expect to recover. We also establish additional reserves based upon our analysis of the quality of the current receivables, the current financial position of our customers and past collections experience. An unexpected change in customer financial condition or future economic uncertainty could result in additional requirements for specific reserves, which could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial position.\nWe are dependent upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price increases.\nWe obtain materials and manufactured components from third-party suppliers. In the absence of labor strikes or other unusual circumstances, substantially all materials and components are normally available from multiple suppliers. However, certain of our businesses receive materials and components from a single source supplier, although alternative suppliers of such materials are generally available. Delays in our suppliers\u2019 abilities, especially any sole suppliers for a particular business, to provide us with necessary materials and components may delay production at a number of our manufacturing locations, or may require us to seek alternative supply sources. Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, suppliers\u2019 impaired financial condition, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism. Any delay in receiving supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPrincipal materials and components used in our various manufacturing processes include steel, castings, engines, tires, hydraulics, cylinders, drive trains, electric controls and motors, and a variety of other commodities and fabricated or manufactured items. Increases in the cost of these materials and components may affect our financial performance. Prices for steel in particular rose considerably starting in the first quarter of 2018. While prices for hot rolled coil steel appear to be trending downward, steel plate prices remain elevated in large part because of the current trade conflict between the U.S. and China. Prices for certain other raw materials and components we purchase from our suppliers also have risen significantly as result of current trade conflicts. If we are not able to recover increased raw material or component costs either from duty draw-back credits or our customers, our margins could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we purchase material and services from our suppliers on terms extended based on our overall credit rating. Deterioration in our credit rating may impact suppliers\u2019 willingness to extend terms and in turn increase the cash requirements of our business.\nWe are subject to currency fluctuations.\nOur products are sold in over 100 countries around the world. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses, revenues and earnings are denominated in other countries\u2019 currencies, including the Euro, British Pound and Australian dollar. Those assets, liabilities, expenses, revenues and earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Due to the continued volatility of foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have an impact on the accuracy of our financial guidance. Such fluctuations in foreign currency rates relative to the U.S. dollar may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our guidance and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We note that the upcoming withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. may negatively impact the value of the British Pound as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies as the U.K. negotiates and executes its exit from the E.U., which is currently expected to occur on March 29, 2019.\nWe may buy protecting or offsetting positions (known as \u201chedges\u201d) in certain currencies to reduce the risk of an adverse currency exchange movement. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Although we partially hedge our revenues and costs, currency fluctuations may impact our financial performance in the future.\nWe are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.\nOur operations are subject to a number of potential risks. Such risks principally include:\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest;\n\u2022\nglobal and regional economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical instability;\n\u2022\nterrorist activities and the U.S. and international response thereto;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country;\n\u2022\nexport duties and quotas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign customs and tariffs;\n\u2022\ncurrent and changing regulatory environments;\n\u2022\ndifficulties protecting our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\ncosts and difficulties in integrating, staffing and managing international operations, especially in developing markets such as China, India, Brazil and the Middle East;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining distribution support;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters; and\n\u2022\ncurrent and changing tax laws.\nIn addition, many of the nations in which we operate have developing legal and economic systems adding greater uncertainty to our operations in those countries than would be expected in North America and Western Europe. These factors may have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future.\nWe must comply with all applicable laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit engaging in corruption for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These anti-corruption laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Our global activities and distribution model are subject to risk of corruption by our employees and in addition, our sales agents, distributors, dealers and other third parties that transact Terex business particularly because these parties are generally not subject to our control. We have an internal policy that expressly prohibits engaging in any commercial bribery and public corruption, including facilitation payments. We conduct corruption risk assessments, we have implemented training programs for our employees with respect to the Company\u2019s prohibition against public corruption and commercial bribery, and we perform reputational due diligence on certain third parties that transact Terex business. In addition, we conduct transaction testing to assess compliance with our internal anti-corruption policy and procedures. However, we cannot assure you that our policies, procedures and programs always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third parties that transact Terex business. We have a zero tolerance policy for violations of anti-corruption laws and our anti-corruption policy. In the event we believe or have reason to believe our employees, agents, representatives, dealers or distributors or other third parties that transact Terex business have or may have violated our anti-corruption policy or applicable anti-corruption laws, we investigate or have outside counsel investigate relevant facts and circumstances. Although we have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of anti-corruption laws could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business including our business with the U.S. government, an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition and a violation of our injunction or cease and desist order with the SEC. See Risk Factor entitled, \u201cWe must comply with an injunction and related obligations imposed by the SEC.\u201d\nWe continue to focus on operational improvement in developing markets such as China, India, Brazil and the Middle East. These efforts will require us to hire, train and retain qualified personnel in countries where language, cultural or regulatory barriers may exist. Any significant difficulties in continuing to improve or expand our operations in developing markets may divert management\u2019s attention from our existing operations and require a greater level of resources than we plan to commit.\nExpansion into developing markets may require modification of products to meet local requirements or preferences. Modification to the design of our products to meet local requirements and preferences may take longer or be more costly than we anticipate and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve international sales growth.\nA material disruption to one of our significant manufacturing plants could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nWe produce most of our machines for each product type at one manufacturing facility. If operations at a significant facility were disrupted as a result of equipment failures, natural disasters, work stoppages, power outages or other reasons, our business, financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. Interruptions in production could increase costs and delay delivery of units in production. Production capacity limits could cause us to reduce or delay sales efforts until production capacity is available.\nWe may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 11,700 people worldwide in our continuing operations businesses. While we have no reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, we cannot assure that future issues with our team members or labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our team members. Any of these factors may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce.\nCompliance with environmental regulations could be costly and require us to make significant expenditures.\nWe generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects and require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. No such incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations.\nIn addition, increasing laws and regulations dealing with environmental aspects of the products we manufacture can result in significant expenditures in designing and manufacturing new forms of equipment that satisfy such new laws and regulations. In particular, climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. While additional regulation of emissions in the future appears likely, it is too early to predict how new regulations would ultimately affect our business, operations or financial results, although government policies limiting greenhouse gas emissions of our products will likely require increased compliance expenditures on our part.\nWhile plans are in place to comply with the phase-in of European Stage V regulations, we are dependent on our engine suppliers to continue to timely deliver engines which meet applicable emissions regulations. A failure to timely receive appropriate engines from our suppliers could result in our being placed in uncompetitive positions or without finished product when needed. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has required, and will continue to require, us to make expenditures, however we do not expect these expenditures to have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe face litigation and product liability claims, class action lawsuits and other liabilities.\nIn our lines of business, numerous suits have been filed alleging damages for accidents that have occurred during use or operation of our products. We are self-insured, up to certain limits, for these product liability exposures, as well as for certain exposures related to general, workers\u2019 compensation and automobile liability. We obtain insurance coverage for catastrophic losses as well as those risks where insurance is required by law or contract. We do not believe that the outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position; however, any significant liabilities not covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are the subject of a securities class action lawsuit and a stockholder derivative lawsuit. These lawsuits generally cover the time period from February 2008 to February 2009 and allege, among other things, that certain of our SEC filings and other public statements contained false and misleading statements which resulted in damages to the Company, the plaintiffs and the members of the purported class when they purchased our securities and that there were breaches of fiduciary duties. The complaints seek, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses. As a result, we are unable to estimate a possible loss or a range of losses for these lawsuits. We believe that the allegations in the securities suit and allegations in the stockholder derivative claim are without merit, and we and the named executive will vigorously defend against them. We believe that we have acted, and continue to act, in compliance with federal securities laws and Delaware law with respect to these matters. On February 13, 2019, the Company and the plaintiffs filed a joint letter to the court indicating that an agreement in principle to settle the securities suit had been reached subject to court approval. The settlement amount is covered by insurance and not material to the financial results of the Company. Until the settlement is finalized and ordered by the court, the outcome of both lawsuits cannot be predicted and, if determined adversely, could ultimately result in us incurring significant liabilities. See Note Q - \u201cLitigation and Contingencies,\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our securities class action lawsuit and stockholder derivative lawsuit.\nWe must comply with an injunction and related obligations imposed by the SEC.\nWe and our directors, officers and employees are required to comply at all times with the terms of a settlement with the SEC that includes an injunction barring us from committing or aiding and abetting any future violations of the anti-fraud, books and records, reporting and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws and related SEC rules. In addition, regarding a separate and unrelated SEC matter, we consented to the entry of an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting future violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws. As a result, if we commit or aid or abet any future violations of the anti-fraud, books and records, reporting and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws and related SEC rules, we are likely to suffer severe penalties, financial and otherwise, that could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems.\nWe rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. As technology continues to evolve, we anticipate that we will collect and store even more data in the future and that our systems will increasingly use remote communication. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but these systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. A failure of or breach in information technology security, particularly through malicious cyber-attacks which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication by both state and non-state actors, could expose us and our customers, distributors and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. In addition, such breaches in security could result in misstated financial information, regulatory action, fines and litigation, and other potential liabilities, as well as the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe current cyber threat environment indicates increased risk for all companies. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber threats and incidents, although none have had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Our information security efforts include programs designed to address security governance, identification and protection of critical assets, insider risk, third-party risk and cyber defense operations. While these measures are designed to reduce the risk of a breach or failure of our information technology systems, no security measures or countermeasures can guarantee that the Company will not experience a significant information security incident in the future.\nThe timing and amount of benefits from the Company\u2019s Execute to Win initiatives may not be as expected and the Company\u2019s financial results could be adversely impacted.\nWe are in the process of implementing our Focus, Simplify and Execute to Win initiatives as part of our strategy to deliver long-term growth and earnings to our shareholders. The Execute to Win component of this strategy has three priority areas: Lifecycle Solutions, Commercial Excellence and Strategic Sourcing. We are making significant investments in each of these priority areas. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize the anticipated benefits of these initiatives. Although Execute to Win is expected to improve future operating margins and revenue growth, if the Company is unable to achieve expected benefits from one or more of these three initiatives or is unable to complete these initiatives without material disruption to our businesses, the timing and amount of benefits may not be as expected and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s competitive position, financial condition, profitability and/or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 58318, "SIC": 3530, "TIC": "TEX"}
