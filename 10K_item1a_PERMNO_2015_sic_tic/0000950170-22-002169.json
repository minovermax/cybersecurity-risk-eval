RISK FACTORS\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe Company is subject to a number of risks that if realized could affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and access to liquidity materially. The Company\u2019s business is subject to uncertainties and risks including:\n\u2022RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae face substantial competition for their intended uses in the targeted markets from products discovered, developed, launched and commercialized both by GSK and by other pharmaceutical companies, which could cause the royalties payable to us pursuant to the GSK Agreements to be less than expected, which in turn would harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall.\n\u2022We are dependent on GSK for the successful commercialization of the products developed under the GSK Agreements. If GSK does not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of these products, is unsuccessful in its efforts, or chooses to reprioritize its commercial programs, our business would be materially harmed.\n\u2022Any adverse change in FDA policy or guidance regarding the use of LABAs to treat asthma could significantly harm our royalty revenues and the price of our securities could fall.\n\u2022Our debt including our convertible subordinated notes and convertible senior notes are senior in capital structure and cash flow, respectively, to our common stockholders. Satisfying the obligations relating to our debt could adversely affect our liquidity or the amount or timing of potential distributions to our stockholders.\n\u2022We rely and will continue to rely on outsourcing arrangements for many of our activities, including financial reporting, accounting, IT and human resources.\n\u2022GSK has indicated to us that it believes its consent may be required before we can engage in certain royalty monetization transactions with third parties, which may inhibit our ability to engage in these transactions.\n\u2022We may be unable to or elect not to return capital to our stockholders.\n\u2022Our investment into the Partnership could subject us to various risks and uncertainties, any of which could impact our investment results and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022The Partnership Agreement limits our ability to withdraw our invested funds from the Partnership.\nRisks Related to our Business\nCurrently, we derive most of our revenues from GSK and our near-term success depends in large part on GSK\u2019s ability to successfully develop and commercialize the products in the respiratory programs partnered with GSK.\nPursuant to the GSK Agreements, GSK is responsible for the development and commercialization of products in the partnered respiratory programs. Royalty revenues from RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae are expected to represent the majority of our foreseeable future revenues from GSK. The amount and timing of revenue from such royalties are unknown and highly uncertain. Our near-term success depends in large part upon the performance by GSK of its commercial obligations under the GSK Agreements and the commercial success of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae. We have no control over GSK\u2019s marketing and sales efforts, and GSK might not be successful, which would harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall.\nOur quarterly royalty revenues may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. The amount of royalties and milestone payments, if any, we receive will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022the extent and effectiveness of the sales and marketing and distribution support GSK provides to our partnered products;\n\u2022market acceptance and demand for our partnered products;\n\u2022changes in the treatment paradigm or standard of care for COPD or asthma, for instance through changes to the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) guidelines;\n\u2022the competitive landscape of generic and branded products and developing therapies that compete with our partnered products, including TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae or products owned by GSK (such as Advair\u00ae) but which are not partnered with us and pricing pressure in the respiratory markets targeted by our partnered products;\n\u2022the size of the market for our partnered products;\n\u2022the mix of sales of our partnered products;\n\u2022decisions as to the timing of product launches, pricing and discounts;\n\u2022reprioritization of GSK\u2019s commercial efforts on other products, including TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae or products owned by GSK (such as Advair\u00ae), which are not partnered with us;\n\u2022GSK\u2019s ability to expand the indications for which our partnered products can be marketed;\n\u2022a satisfactory efficacy and safety profile as demonstrated in a broad patient population;\n\u2022acceptance of, and ongoing satisfaction with, our partnered products by the medical community, patients receiving therapy and third-party payors;\n\u2022timing and amounts of payor rebate adjustments and prior period rebate adjustments;\n\u2022seasonal fluctuations of demand;\n\u2022the ability of patients to be able to afford our partnered products or obtain health care coverage that covers our partnered products;\n\u2022safety concerns in the marketplace for respiratory therapies in general and with our partnered products in particular;\n\u2022regulatory developments relating to the manufacture or continued use of our partnered products;\n\u2022the requirement to conduct additional post-approval studies or trials for our partnered products;\n\u2022GSK\u2019s ability to obtain regulatory approval of our partnered products in additional countries;\n\u2022the unfavorable outcome of any potential litigation relating to our partnered products;\n\u2022general economic conditions in the jurisdictions where our partnered products are sold, including microeconomic disruptions or slowdowns; or\n\u2022if our royalty revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nWhen the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products, including but not limited to generic forms of Advair, that compete with RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae or a generic form of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, the royalties payable to us pursuant to the GSK Agreements will be less than anticipated, which in turn would harm our business and the price of our securities could fall.\nOnce an NDA or marketing authorization application outside the United States is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201clisted drug\u201d that can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA in the United States. Agency regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes in the United States and in nearly every pharmaceutical market around the world. Numerous companies have brought to market generic forms of the ICS/LABA drug Advair\u00ae since certain patents covering the Advair\u00ae delivery device expired in 2016. In general, these manufactures are required to conduct a number of clinical efficacy, pharmacokinetic and device studies to demonstrate equivalence to Advair, per FDA\u2019s September 2013 draft guidance document. These studies are designed to demonstrate that the generic product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, exposure and clinical efficacy as the branded product. These generic equivalents, which must meet the same exacting quality standards as branded products, may be significantly less costly to bring to market, and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product and products that may compete with such branded product is typically lost to the generic product.\nIn January 2019, Mylan announced that the FDA approved Wixela\u2122 Inhu\u2122 (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, USP), the first generic of ADVAIR DISKUS\u00ae. In that same month, Teva announced that the FDA approved two of their products for adolescent and adult patients with asthma, one of which is AirDuo\u2122 RespiClick\u00ae (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder), a non-AB substitutable generic version of Advair\u00ae. In January 2020, Astra Zeneca launched an authorized generic version of Symbicort. In December 2020, Hikma/Vectura announced that it received FDA approval and launched its generic version of GSK\u2019s Advair Diskus\u00ae.\nIn April 2016, the FDA issued draft guidance documents covering Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol Trifenatate (FF/VI), the active ingredients used in RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae. Introduction of generic products that compete against ICS/LABA products, like RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, would materially adversely impact our future royalty revenue, profitability and cash flows. We cannot yet ascertain what impact these generic products and any future approved generic products will have on any sales of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae or ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, or TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, if approved.\nReduced prices and reimbursement rates due to the actions of governments, payors, or competition or other healthcare cost containment initiatives such as restrictions on use, may negatively impact royalties generated under the GSK Agreements.\nThe continuing efforts of governments, pharmaceutical benefit management organizations (\u201cPBMs\u201d), insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care costs to contain or reduce costs of health care has adversely affected the price, market access, and total revenues of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and may continue to adversely affect them in the future. In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competitive activity, which has resulted in lower overall prices for our products.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, \u201cPPACA\u201d) and other legislative or regulatory requirements or potential legislative or regulatory actions regarding healthcare and insurance matters, along with the trend toward managed healthcare in the U.S., could adversely influence the purchase of healthcare products and reduce demand and prices for our partnered products. This could harm GSK\u2019s ability to market our partnered products and significantly reduce future revenues. For example, when GSK launched RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae for the treatment of COPD in the U.S. in October 2013, GSK experienced significant challenges gaining coverage at some of the largest PBMs, healthcare payors, and providers and lower overall prices than expected. Recent actions by U.S. PBMs in particular have increased discount levels for respiratory products resulting in lower net sales pricing realized for products in our collaboration. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. We believe that pricing pressures will continue and may increase. This may make it difficult for GSK to sell our partnered products at a price acceptable to us or GSK or to generate revenues in line with our analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations, which may cause the price of our securities to fall.\nMore recently, presidential administrations and the U.S. Congress have taken actions in an effort to modify or replace PPACA and to implement or pass other reforms to the healthcare system, including proposed legislation related to the pricing of pharmaceuticals. There is uncertainty with respect to any potential changes that may be proposed and what the impact, if any, will be on our business, including the impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by PPACA. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be considered and potentially adopted, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures and may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur current revenues are from royalties derived from sales of our respiratory products partnered with GSK, RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae. If the treatment paradigm for the indications our partnered products are approved for change or if GSK is unable to, or does not devote sufficient resources to, maintain or continue increasing sales of these products, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe currently depend on royalties from sales of our products partnered with GSK to support our existing operations. The treatment paradigm for COPD and asthma constantly evolves. For instance, in November 2018, the GOLD guidelines were revised to favorably position bronchodilator monotherapy and LABA/LAMA treatment ahead of ICS/LABA for the treatment of COPD unless the patient has frequent exacerbations, or an eosinophil count greater than 300 per cubic microliter. The use of ICS in COPD is also recommended for patients requiring triple therapy (LABA, LAMA, ICS). If the treatment paradigms were to change further, causing our partnered products to fall out of favor, or if GSK were unable, or did not devote sufficient resources, to maintain or continue increasing RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae sales, our results of operations would likely suffer, and the price of our securities could fall.\nIf the commercialization of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae or TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae in the countries in which they have received regulatory approval encounters any delays or adverse developments, or perceived delays or adverse developments, or if sales or payor coverage does not meet investors\u2019, analysts\u2019, or our expectations, our business will be harmed, and the price of our securities could fall.\nUnder our agreements with our collaborative partner GSK, GSK has full responsibility for commercialization of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae. GSK has launched RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae in a number of countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany, among others. The commercialization of the products in countries where they are already launched and the commercialization launch in new countries are still subject to fluctuating overall pricing levels and uncertain timeframes to obtain payor coverage. Any delays or adverse developments or perceived additional delays or adverse developments with respect to the commercialization of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae including if sales or payor coverage does not meet investors\u2019, analysts\u2019, or our expectations, would significantly harm our business and the price of our securities could fall.\nWe are dependent on GSK for the successful commercialization and development of products under the GSK Agreements. If GSK does not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization or development of these products, is unsuccessful in its efforts, or chooses to reprioritize its commercial programs, our business would be materially harmed.\nGSK is responsible for all clinical and other product development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities for products developed under the GSK Agreements, including RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae. Our royalty revenues under the GSK Agreements may not meet our, analysts\u2019, or investors\u2019 expectations, due to a number of important factors. GSK has a substantial respiratory product portfolio in addition to the partnered products that are covered by the GSK Agreements. GSK may make respiratory product portfolio decisions or statements about its portfolio which may be, or may be perceived to be, harmful to the respiratory products partnered with us. For instance, GSK has wide discretion in determining the efforts and resources that it will apply to the development and commercialization of our partnered products. In addition, GSK may determine to focus its commercialization efforts on its own products or TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae. For example, in January 2015, GSK launched Incruse\u00ae (UMEC) in the U.S., which is a LAMA for the treatment of COPD. GSK may determine to focus its marketing efforts on Incruse, which could have the effect of decreasing the potential market share of ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and lowering the royalties we may receive for such product. Alternatively, GSK may decide to market TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae to eventually compete directly against sales of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae. Following the FDA approval of TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae in September 2017, GSK\u2019s diligent efforts obligations regarding commercialization matters now have the objective of focusing on the best interests of patients and maximizing the net value of the overall portfolio of products under the GSK Agreements. Since GSK\u2019s commercialization efforts following this regulatory approval are guided by a portfolio approach across products in which we have retained our full interest and also products in which we now have only a small portion of our former interest, GSK\u2019s commercialization efforts may have the effect of reducing the overall value of our remaining interests in the GSK Agreements in the future. If GSK prioritizes TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, we will only be entitled to a 15% economic interest of the royalties paid pursuant to the GSK Agreements with respect to this product. In the event GSK does not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of our partnered products or chooses to reprioritize its commercial programs, our business, operations and stock price would be negatively affected.\nAny adverse change in FDA policy or guidance regarding the use of LABAs to treat asthma could significantly harm our royalty revenues and the price of our securities could fall.\nOn February 18, 2010, the FDA announced that LABAs should not be used alone in the treatment of asthma and it will require manufacturers to include this warning in the product labels of these drugs, along with taking other steps to reduce the overall use of these medicines. The FDA now requires that the product labels for LABA medicines reflect, among other things, that the use of LABAs is contraindicated without the use of an asthma controller medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid, that LABAs should only be used long term in patients whose asthma cannot be adequately controlled on asthma controller medications, and that LABAs should be used for the shortest duration of time required to achieve control of asthma symptoms and discontinued, if possible, once asthma control is achieved. In addition, in March 2010, the FDA held an Advisory Committee to discuss the design of medical research studies (known as \u201cclinical trial design\u201d) to evaluate serious asthma outcomes (such as hospitalizations, a procedure using a breathing tube known as intubation, or death) with the use of LABAs in the treatment of asthma in adults, adolescents, and children. Further, in April 2011, the FDA announced that to further evaluate the safety of LABAs, it required the manufacturers of currently marketed LABAs to conduct additional randomized, double blind, controlled clinical trials comparing the addition of LABAs to inhaled corticosteroids versus inhaled corticosteroids alone. These post-marketing studies have been completed and the FDA stated that treating asthma with LABAs in combination with ICS did not result in significantly more serious asthma-related side effects than treatment with ICS alone. The FDA subsequently removed the black box warning from the ICS/LABA package inserts. Although this concern appears to be resolved, it is unknown at this time what, if any, future concerns could impact the use of ICS/LABA and its potential impact on the prospects for FF/VI. Any adverse change in FDA policy or guidance regarding the use of LABAs to treat asthma could significantly harm our business and the price of our securities could fall.\nAny adverse developments to the regulatory status of either RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae or TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae in the countries in which they have received regulatory approval, including labeling restrictions, safety findings, or any other limitation to usage, would harm our business and may cause the price of our securities to fall.\nAlthough RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae are approved and marketed in a number of countries, it is possible that adverse changes to the regulatory status of these products could occur in the event new safety issues are identified, treatment guidelines are changed, or new studies fail to demonstrate product benefits. A number of notable pharmaceutical products have experienced adverse developments during commercialization that have resulted in the product being withdrawn, approved uses being limited, or new warnings being included. In the event that any adverse regulatory changes were to occur to any of our products, our business would be harmed, and the price of our securities could fall.\nAny adverse developments or results or perceived adverse developments or results with respect to the ongoing studies for FF/VI in asthma or COPD, for UMEC/VI in COPD, or any future studies would significantly harm our business and the price of our securities could fall, and if regulatory authorities in those countries in which approval has not yet been granted determine that the ongoing studies for FF/VI in asthma or COPD or the ongoing studies for UMEC/VI for COPD do not demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy, the continued development of FF/VI or UMEC/VI or both could be significantly delayed, they might not be approved by these regulatory authorities, and even if approved they may be subject to restrictive labeling, any of which might harm our business, and the price of our securities could fall.\nAlthough we have announced the completion of, and reported certain top-line data from, the Phase 3 registrational program for FF/VI in COPD and asthma, additional studies of FF/VI are underway or may commence in the future. Any adverse developments or perceived adverse developments with respect to any prior, current or future studies in these programs could significantly harm our business and the price of our securities could fall.\nAlthough the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and Health Canada and other jurisdictions have approved ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, it has not yet been approved in all jurisdictions.\nAny adverse developments or results or perceived adverse developments or results with respect to other pending or future regulatory submissions for the FF/VI program or the UMEC/VI program might significantly harm our business and the price of our securities could fall. Examples of such adverse developments include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022not every study, nor every dose in every study, in the Phase 3 programs for FF/VI achieved its primary endpoint and regulatory authorities may determine that additional clinical studies are required;\n\u2022safety, efficacy or other concerns arising from clinical or non-clinical studies in these programs having to do with the LABA VI, which is a component of FF/VI and UMEC/VI;\n\u2022analysts adjusting their sales forecasts downward from previous projections based on results or interpretations of results of prior, current or future studies;\n\u2022safety, efficacy or other concerns arising from clinical or non-clinical studies in these programs;\n\u2022regulatory authorities determining that the Phase 3 programs in asthma or in COPD raise safety concerns or do not demonstrate adequate efficacy; or\n\u2022any change in FDA (or comparable foreign regulatory agency) policy or guidance regarding the use of LABAs to treat asthma or the use of LABAs combined with a LAMA to treat COPD.\nRELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae face substantial competition for their intended uses in the targeted markets from products discovered, developed, launched and commercialized both by GSK and by other pharmaceutical companies, which could cause the royalties payable to us pursuant to the LABA Collaboration Agreement to be less than expected, which in turn would harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall.\nGSK has responsibility for obtaining regulatory approval, launching and commercializing RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae for their intended uses in the targeted markets around the world. While these products have received regulatory approval and have been launched and commercialized in the U.S. and certain other targeted markets, the products face substantial competition from existing products previously developed and commercialized both by GSK and by other competing pharmaceutical companies and can expect to face additional competition from new products that are discovered, developed and commercialized by the same pharmaceutical companies and other competitors going forward. For example, sales of generic Advair\u00ae, GSK\u2019s approved medicine for both COPD and asthma, continue to have a negative impact on sales of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae.\nMany of the pharmaceutical companies competing in respiratory markets are international in scope with substantial financial, technical and personnel resources that permit them to discover, develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize new products in a highly efficient and low-cost manner at competitive prices to consumers. In addition, many of these competitors have substantial commercial infrastructure that facilitates commercializing their products in a highly efficient and low-cost manner at competitive prices to consumers. The market for products developed for treatment of COPD and asthma continues to experience significant innovation and reduced cost in bringing products to market over time. There can be no assurance that RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae will not be replaced by new products that are deemed more effective at lower cost to consumers. The ability of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae to succeed and achieve the anticipated level of sales depends on the commercial and development performance of GSK to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage over other products with the same intended use in the targeted markets.\nIn addition, following the September 2017 FDA approval of TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, GSK\u2019s diligent efforts obligations regarding commercialization matters has the objective of focusing on the best interests of patients and maximizing the net value of the overall portfolio of products under the GSK Agreements. Since GSK\u2019s commercialization efforts following this regulatory approval are guided by a portfolio approach across products in which we have retained our full interest and also products in which we now have only a small portion of our former interest, GSK\u2019s commercialization efforts may have the effect of reducing the overall value of our remaining interests in the GSK Agreements in the future. GSK also received in April 2018 an expanded label approval for TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, allowing it to be used by U.S. physicians as first line therapy in appropriate COPD patients. A similar expanded use label was granted by the European Medicines Agency in September 2018. Innoviva is only entitled to a 15% economic interest in the future payments made by GSK under the GSK Agreements with respect to this product.\nIf sales of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae are less than anticipated because of existing or future competition in the markets in which they are commercialized, including competition from existing and new products that are perceived as lower cost or more effective, our royalty payments could be less than anticipated, which in turn would harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall.\nWe and GSK received regulatory approval in the U.S. and positive regulatory opinion in Europe for TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae as triple combination treatments for COPD. As a result of the Spin-Off, most of our economic rights in this program and other programs were assigned to Theravance Biopharma. If these programs are successful and GSK and the respiratory market in general views triple combination therapy as significantly more beneficial than existing therapies, including RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, our business could be harmed, and the price of our securities could fall.\nThe use of triple therapy is supported by the GOLD guidelines in symptomatic patients with severe COPD and a high risk of exacerbations. Prior to the Spin-Off, we were entitled to receive 100% of any royalties payable under the GSK Agreements arising from sales of TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and any other product or combination of products that may be discovered and developed in the future under the GSK Agreements. As a result of the transactions effected by the Spin-Off, however, we are now only entitled to receive 15% of any contingent payments and royalties payable by GSK from sales of TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae under the GSK Agreements which were assigned to TRC, while Theravance Biopharma receives 85% of those same payments. The commercial success of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae may be adversely affected if GSK or the respiratory markets view TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae or other combination therapies as more beneficial. GSK\u2019s diligent efforts obligations regarding commercialization matters have the objective of focusing on the best interests of patients and maximizing the net value of the overall portfolio of products under the GSK Agreements. Since GSK\u2019s commercialization efforts following this regulatory approval are guided by a portfolio approach across products in which we have retained our full interest and also products in which we now have only a small portion of our former interest, GSK\u2019s commercialization efforts may have the effect of reducing the overall value of our remaining interests in the GSK Agreements in the future.\nWe may not be able to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe have net operating loss carryforwards and other significant U.S. tax attributes that we believe could offset otherwise taxable income in the U.S. As a part of the overall Spin-Off transaction, the transfer of certain assets by us to Theravance Biopharma and our distribution of Theravance Biopharma ordinary shares resulted in taxable transfers pursuant to applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) and Treasury Regulations. The taxable gain recognized by us attributable to the transfer of certain assets to Theravance Biopharma generally equaled the excess of the fair market value of each asset transferred over our adjusted tax basis in such asset. Although we did not recognize any gain with respect to the cash we transferred to Theravance Biopharma, we may recognize substantial gain based on the fair market value of the other assets (other than cash) transferred to Theravance Biopharma. The determination of the fair market value of these assets is subjective and could be subject to adjustments or future challenge by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), which could result in an increase in the amount of gain realized by us as a result of the transfer. Our U.S. federal income tax resulting from any gain recognized upon the transfer of our assets to Theravance Biopharma (including any increased U.S. federal income tax that may result from a subsequent determination of higher fair market values for the transferred assets), may be reduced by our net operating loss carryforward. The net operating loss carryforwards available in any year to offset our net taxable income will be reduced following a more than 50% change in ownership during any period of 36 consecutive months (an \u201cownership change\u201d) as determined under the Code. Transactions involving our common stock, even those outside our control, such as purchases or sales by investors, within the testing period could result in an ownership change. We have conducted an analysis to determine whether an ownership change had occurred since inception through October 31, 2021 and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company did not experience an ownership change during the testing period. Subsequent changes in our ownership or sale of our stock could have the effect of limiting the use of our net operating losses in the future. There may be certain annual limitations for utilization based on the above-described ownership change provisions. In addition, we may not be able to have sufficient future taxable income prior to their expiration because net operating losses have carryforward periods. Future changes in federal and state tax laws pertaining to net operating loss carryforwards may also cause limitations or restrictions from us claiming such net operating losses. If the net operating loss carryforwards become unavailable to us or are fully utilized, our future taxable income will not be shielded from federal and state income taxation absent certain U.S. federal and state tax credits, and the funds otherwise available for general corporate purposes would be reduced.\nIf any product candidates in any respiratory program partnered with GSK were not approved by regulatory authorities or are determined to be unsafe or ineffective in humans, our business would be adversely affected and the price of our securities could fall.\nThe FDA must approve any new medicine before it can be marketed and sold in the U.S. Our partner GSK must provide the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities with data from preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrate that the product candidates are safe and effective for a defined indication before they can be approved for commercial distribution. GSK will not obtain this approval for a partnered product candidate unless and until the FDA approves an NDA. The processes by which regulatory approvals are obtained from the FDA to market and sell a new product are complex, require a number of years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources. In order to market medicines in foreign countries, separate regulatory approvals must be obtained in each country. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Conversely, failure to obtain approval in one or more country may make approval in other countries more difficult.\nClinical studies involving product candidates partnered with GSK may reveal that those candidates are ineffective, inferior to existing approved medicines, unacceptably toxic, or that they have other unacceptable side effects. In addition, the results of preclinical studies do not necessarily predict clinical success, and larger and later-stage clinical studies may not produce the same results as earlier-stage clinical studies.\nFrequently, product candidates that have shown promising results in early preclinical or clinical studies have subsequently suffered significant setbacks or failed in later clinical or non-clinical studies. In addition, clinical and non-clinical studies of potential products often reveal that it is not possible or practical to continue development efforts for these product candidates. If these studies are substantially delayed or fail to prove the safety and effectiveness of product candidates in development partnered with GSK, GSK may not receive regulatory approval for such product candidates and our business and financial condition could be materially harmed and the price of our securities might fall.\nSeveral well-publicized Complete Response letters issued by the FDA and safety-related product withdrawals, suspensions, post-approval labeling revisions to include boxed warnings and changes in approved indications over the last several years, as well as growing public and governmental scrutiny of safety issues, have created a conservative regulatory environment. The implementation of new laws and regulations and revisions to FDA clinical trial design guidance have increased uncertainty regarding the approvability of a new drug. Further, there are additional requirements for approval of new drugs, including advisory committee meetings for new chemical entities, and formal risk evaluation and mitigation strategy at the FDA\u2019s discretion. These laws, regulations, additional requirements and changes in interpretation could cause non-approval or further delays in the FDA\u2019s review and approval of any product candidates in any respiratory program partnered with GSK.\nEven if product candidates in any respiratory program partnered with GSK receive regulatory approval, as is the case with RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, commercialization of such products may be adversely affected by regulatory actions and oversight.\nEven if GSK receives regulatory approval for product candidates in any respiratory program partnered with GSK, this approval may include limitations on the indicated uses for which GSK can market the medicines or the patient population that may utilize the medicines, which may limit the market for the medicines or put GSK at a competitive disadvantage relative to alternative therapies. These restrictions make it more difficult to market the approved products.\nFor example, at the joint meeting of the Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the FDA regarding the sNDA for BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae as a treatment for asthma, the advisory committee recommended that a large LABA safety trial with BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae should be required in adults and in children ages 12-17, similar to the ongoing LABA safety trials being conducted as an FDA Post-Marketing Requirement by each of the manufacturers of LABA containing asthma treatments. The FDA did not concur with the recommendation. A pediatric program including patients 5-17 years of age is currently ongoing.\nIn addition, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the approved product remain subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. If we or GSK become aware of previously unknown problems with an approved product in the U.S. or overseas or at contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on the product, the contract manufacturers or on GSK, including requiring it to reformulate the product, conduct additional clinical studies, change the labeling of the product, withdraw the product from the market or require the contract manufacturer to implement changes to its facilities. GSK is also subject to regulation by regional, national, state and local agencies, including the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory bodies, as well as governmental authorities in those foreign countries in which any of the product candidates in any respiratory program partnered with GSK are approved for commercialization. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern to varying degrees the research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities relating to prescription pharmaceutical products, including non-clinical and clinical testing, approval, production, labeling, sale, distribution, import, export, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information and promotion. Any failure to maintain regulatory approval would limit GSK\u2019s ability to commercialize the product candidates in any respiratory program partnered with GSK, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition, and which may cause the price of our securities to fall.\nAcquisitions or strategic investments we have made or may make could turn out to be unsuccessful.\nAs part of our strategy, we frequently monitor and analyze acquisition or investment opportunities that we believe will create value for our shareholders.\nExisting or future acquisitions and investments could involve numerous risks that may prevent us from fully realizing the benefits that we anticipated as a result of the transaction. These risks include the failure to derive any commercial value from the acquired technology, products and intellectual property including as a result of the failure to obtain regulatory approval or to monetize products once approved, as well as risks from lengthy product development and high upfront development costs without guarantee of successful results. Patents and other intellectual property rights covering acquired technology and/or intellectual property may not be obtained, and if obtained, may not be sufficient to fully protect the technology or intellectual property. We may be subject to liabilities, including unanticipated litigation costs, that are not covered by indemnification protection we may obtain. As we pursue or consummate a strategic acquisition or investment, we may value the acquired or funded company incorrectly, fail to successfully manage our operations as our asset diversity increases, expend unforeseen costs during the acquisition or integration process, or encounter other unanticipated risks or challenges. Once an investment is made, we may fail to value it accurately, properly account for it in our consolidated financial statements, or successfully divest it or otherwise realize the value which we originally invested or have subsequently reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Any failure by us to effectively limit such risks as we implement our acquisitions or strategic investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and may negatively impact our net income and cause the price of our securities to fall.\nFor instance, on February 1, 2022, we submitted to Entasis Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ETTX) (\"Entasis\") a non-binding proposal to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Entasis not owned by us for all cash consideration. The proposal is non-binding and is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of requisite board and shareholder approvals, confirmatory diligence and negotiation and execution of a definitive merger agreement. There can be no assurance that a definitive agreement with respect to the transaction will be executed or, if executed, whether the transaction will be consummated. There is also no certainty as to the timetable for execution of a definitive agreement, if any. Any failure by us to complete this acquisition on a timely basis, or at all, or to realize the benefits that we expect as a result of the acquisition, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have a significant amount of debt including our convertible subordinated notes and convertible senior notes that are senior in capital structure and cash flow, respectively, to our common stockholders. Satisfying the obligations relating to our debt could adversely affect our liquidity or the amount or timing of potential distributions to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $433.5 million in total debt outstanding, comprised primarily of $241.0 million in principal that remains outstanding under our convertible subordinated notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d) and $192.5 million in principal outstanding under our convertible senior notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d) (the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes hereinafter, the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Notes are unsecured debt and are not redeemable by us prior to the maturity date. Holders of the Notes may require us to purchase all or any portion of their Notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus any unpaid interest, upon a fundamental change. A fundamental change is generally defined to include a merger involving us, an acquisition of a majority of our outstanding common stock, and, under the 2023 Notes, the change of a majority of our Board of Directors without the approval of the Board of Directors. In addition, to the extent we pursue and complete a monetization transaction or a transaction that modifies our corporate structure, the structure of such transaction may qualify as a fundamental change under the Notes, which could trigger the put rights of the holders of the Notes, in which case we would be required to use a portion of the net proceeds from such transaction to repurchase any Notes put to us.\nSatisfying the obligations of this debt could adversely affect the amount or timing of any distributions to our stockholders. We may choose to satisfy, repurchase, or refinance this debt through public or private equity or debt financings if we deem such financings available on favorable terms. If any or all of the Notes are not converted into shares of our common stock before the maturity date, we will have to pay the holders the full aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Any of the above payments could have a material adverse effect on our cash position. If we fail to satisfy these obligations, it may result in a default under the indenture, which could result in a default under certain of our other debt instruments, if any. Any such default would harm our business and the price of our securities could fall.\nIf we lose key management personnel, or if we fail to retain our key employees, our ability to manage our business may be impaired.\nWe have a small management team and very few employees. We are highly dependent on principal members of our management team and a small group of key employees to operate our business. None of our employees have employment commitments for any fixed period of time and all may leave our employment at will. If we fail to retain our qualified personnel or to replace them when they leave, our ability to manage our business may be impaired, which may cause the price of our securities to fall.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on outsourcing arrangements for many of our activities, including financial reporting, accounting, IT, human resources, strategic investment evaluation, business acquisition and integration.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had only five employees and, as a result, we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on outsourcing arrangements for a significant portion of our activities, including financial reporting, accounting, IT, human resources, strategic investment evaluation, business acquisition and integration, as well as for certain of our functions as a public company. We may have limited control over these third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will perform their obligations in an effective and timely manner.\nAs we continue to develop our business, including through strategic acquisitions and investments, our mix of assets and our sources of income may require that we register with the SEC as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe are not currently, nor do we currently intend to become, registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"the 40 Act\"). We are primarily engaged, and hold ourselves as being primarily engaged, in the royalty management business and not primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. In addition, we monitor our mix of assets to ensure that we do not otherwise meet the definition of an investment company. Accordingly, we are not subject to the provisions of the 40 Act, such as compliance with the 40 Act\u2019s registration and reporting requirements, capital structure requirements, affiliate transaction restrictions, conflict of interest rules, requirements for disinterested directors, and other substantive provisions.\nA company will generally be deemed to be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d for purposes of the 40 Act if:\n\u2022it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities; or\n\u2022absent an applicable exemption or exclusion, it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\nIf the Company were to inadvertently meet the definition of an \u201cinvestment company\u201d and be required to register with the SEC under the 40 Act, the restrictions imposed by the 40 Act would likely require changes in the way we do business and add significant administrative burdens to our operations. In order to ensure that we do not fall within the 40 Act, we may need to take various actions which we might otherwise not pursue. These actions may include restructuring the Company and/or modifying our mix of assets and sources of income.\nThe rules and interpretations of the SEC, the SEC staff, and the courts relating to the definition of an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the 40 Act are highly complex in numerous respects. While we currently intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company, we can give no assurances that we will not (i) determine it to be in the Company\u2019s and our stockholders\u2019 interest to register as an \u201cinvestment company,\u201d and/or (ii) meet the definition of an \u201cinvestment company\u201d and be required to register with the SEC under the 40 Act.\nProlonged economic uncertainties or downturns, as well as unstable market, credit and financial conditions, may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business and have serious adverse consequences on our business.\nThe global economic downturn and market instability has made the business climate more volatile and more costly. These economic conditions, and uncertainty as to the general direction of the macroeconomic environment, are beyond our control and may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. While we believe we have adequate capital resources to meet current working capital and capital expenditure requirements, a lingering economic downturn or significant increase in our expenses could require additional financing at less than attractive rates or on terms that are excessively dilutive to existing stockholders. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and could require us to delay or abandon clinical development plans.\nSales of our partnered products will be dependent, in large part, on reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, distribution partners and other organizations. As a result of negative trends in the general economy in the U.S. or other jurisdictions in which we may do business, these organizations may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment. In addition, federal and state health authorities may reduce Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, and private insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement could negatively affect our or our partners\u2019 product sales and revenue.\nIn addition, we rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business. During challenging and uncertain economic times and in tight credit markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors, suppliers or partners. If such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Alliance with GSK\nBecause all our current revenues and near-term projected revenues have historically been derived from products under the GSK Agreements, disputes with GSK could harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall.\nHistorically, all of our current and near-term projected revenues have been derived from products under the GSK Agreements. We expect royalties from such products will likely continue to comprise a substantial majority of our revenues in the future. Any action or inaction by either GSK or us that results in a material dispute, allegation of breach, litigation, arbitration, or significant disagreement between the parties may be interpreted negatively by the market or by our investors, could harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall. Examples of these kinds of issues include but are not limited to non-performance of contractual obligations and allegations of non-performance, disagreements over the relative marketing and sales efforts for our partnered products and other GSK respiratory products, disputes over public statements, and similar matters. In addition, while we obtained GSK\u2019s consent to the Spin-Off as structured, GSK could decide to challenge various aspects of our post-Spin-Off operation of TRC, the limited liability company jointly owned by us and Theravance Biopharma, as violating or allowing it to terminate the GSK Agreements. Although we believe our operation of TRC fully complies with the GSK Agreements and applicable law, there can be no assurance that we would prevail against any such claims by GSK. Moreover, regardless of the merit of any claims by GSK, we may incur significant cost and diversion of resources in defending them. In addition, any market or investor uncertainty about the respiratory programs partnered with GSK or the enforceability of the GSK Agreements could result in significant reduction in the market price of our securities and in other material harm to our business.\nBecause GSK is a strategic partner, it may take actions that in certain cases are materially harmful to our business or to our stockholders.\nGSK is a strategic partner with rights and obligations under the GSK Agreements that cause its interests to differ from our interests and those of our stockholders. In particular, GSK has a substantial respiratory product portfolio in addition to the partnered products that are covered by the GSK Agreements. GSK may make respiratory product portfolio decisions or statements about its portfolio which may be, or may be perceived to be, harmful to the respiratory products partnered with us. For example, GSK could promote its non-GSK/Innoviva respiratory products or a partnered product for which we are entitled to receive a lower percentage of royalties, delay or terminate the development or commercialization of the respiratory programs covered by the GSK Agreements, or take other actions, such as making public statements, that have a negative effect on our stock price. In this regard and by way of example, sales of Advair\u00ae, GSK\u2019s approved medicine for both COPD and asthma, continue to be significantly greater than sales of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, and GSK has indicated publicly that it intends to continue commercializing Advair\u00ae. Also, given the potential future royalty payments which GSK may be obligated to pay under the GSK Agreements, GSK may seek to acquire us in order to reduce those payment obligations. The timing of when GSK may seek to acquire us could potentially be when it possesses information regarding the status of drug programs covered by the GSK Agreements that has not been publicly disclosed and is not otherwise known to us. As a result of these differing interests, GSK may take actions that it believes are in its best interest but which might not be in our best interest or the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, following the FDA regulatory approval of TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae in September 2017, GSK\u2019s diligent efforts obligations as to commercialization matters under the GSK Agreements has had the objective of focusing on the best interests of patients and maximizing the net value of the overall portfolio of products under the GSK Agreements. Since GSK\u2019s commercialization efforts following this regulatory approval have been guided by a portfolio approach across products in which we have retained our full interest and also products in which we now have only a portion of our former interest, GSK\u2019s commercialization efforts may have the effect of reducing the overall value of our remaining interests in the products covered by the GSK Agreements in the future.\nGSK\u2019s diligent efforts obligations as to commercialization matters under the GSK Agreements have had the objective of focusing on the best interests of patients and maximizing the net value of the overall portfolio of products under the GSK Agreements, which may be harmful to both our business and our stockholders.\nFollowing the FDA approval of TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae in September 2017, GSK\u2019s diligent efforts obligations as to commercialization matters under the GSK Agreements have had the objective of focusing on the best interests of patients and maximizing the net value of the overall portfolio of products under the GSK Agreements. As such, GSK may prioritize TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, and if GSK and the respiratory market in general view this triple combination therapy as significantly more beneficial than existing therapies, including RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, this may be harmful to our business, operations and stock price. If GSK prioritizes TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, we will only be entitled to a 15% economic interest of the royalties paid pursuant to the commercialization of our partnered products or if GSK chooses to reprioritize its commercial programs, our businesses, operations and stock price would be negatively affected.\nGSK has also indicated to us that it believes its consent may be required before we can engage in certain royalty monetization transactions with third parties, which may inhibit our ability to engage in these transactions.\nIn the course of our discussions with GSK concerning the Spin-Off of Theravance Biopharma, GSK indicated to us that it believes that its consent may be required before we can engage in certain transactions designed to monetize the future value of royalties that may be payable to us from GSK under the GSK Agreements. GSK has informed us that it believes that there may be certain covenants included in these types of transactions that might violate certain provisions of the GSK Agreements. Although we believe that we can structure royalty monetization transactions in a manner that fully complies with the requirements of the GSK Agreements without GSK\u2019s consent, a third party in a proposed monetization transaction may nonetheless insist that we obtain GSK\u2019s consent for the transaction or restructure the transaction on less favorable terms. We have obtained GSK\u2019s agreement that (i) we may grant certain pre-agreed covenants in connection with monetization of our interests in RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and vilanterol monotherapy and portions of our interests in TRC, and (ii) it will not unreasonably withhold its consent to our requests to grant other covenants, provided among other conditions, that in each case, the covenants are not granted in favor of a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company with a product either being developed or commercialized for the treatment of respiratory disease. If we seek GSK\u2019s consent to grant covenants other than pre-agreed covenants, we may not be able to obtain GSK\u2019s consent on reasonable terms, or at all. If we proceed with a royalty monetization transaction that is not otherwise covered by the GSK Agreement without GSK\u2019s consent, GSK could request that its consent be obtained or seek to enjoin or otherwise challenge the transaction as violating or allowing it to terminate the GSK Agreements. Regardless of the merit of any claims by GSK, we would incur significant cost and diversion of resources in defending against GSK\u2019s claims or asserting our own claims and GSK may seek concessions from us in order to provide its consent. Any uncertainty about whether or when we could engage in a royalty monetization transaction, the potential impact on the enforceability of the GSK Agreements or the loss of potential royalties from the respiratory programs partnered with GSK, could impair our ability to pursue a return of capital strategy for our stockholders ahead of our receipt of significant royalties from GSK, result in significant reduction in the market price of our securities and cause other material harm to our business.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Uncertainty\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which are necessary to build name and brand recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trademarks or trade names similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build name and brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trademark or trade name infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. There is also a risk that if there is confusion in the marketplace, the reputation, performance and/or actions of such third parties may negatively impact our stock price and our business. We therefore adopted a new brand, Innoviva, in January 2016. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name and brand recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand successfully, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, our business may be harmed.\nIf the efforts of our partner, GSK, to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to products in any respiratory program partnered with GSK are not adequate, the future commercialization of any such product could be delayed, limited or prevented, which would materially harm our business and the price of our securities could fall.\nTo the extent the intellectual property protection of products in any respiratory program partnered with GSK is successfully challenged or encounter problems with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other comparable agencies throughout the world, the commercialization of these products could be delayed, limited or prevented. Any challenge to the intellectual property protection of a late-stage development asset or approved product arising from any respiratory program partnered with GSK could harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall.\nOur commercial success depends in part on products in any respiratory program partnered with GSK not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert that these products are using their proprietary rights without authorization. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of GSK\u2019s technologies infringes upon these patents. Furthermore, parties making claims against GSK may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block GSK\u2019s ability to further develop or commercialize one or more of the product candidates or products in any respiratory program partnered with GSK.\nIn the event of a successful claim of infringement against GSK, it may have to pay substantial damages, obtain one or more licenses from third parties or pay royalties. In addition, even in the absence of litigation, GSK may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance its research or allow commercialization of the products. GSK may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, GSK would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of the products, which could harm our business significantly. In addition, in the future GSK could be required to initiate litigation to enforce its proprietary rights against infringement by third parties. Prosecution of these claims to enforce its rights against others would involve substantial litigation expenses. If GSK fails to effectively enforce its proprietary rights related to our partnered respiratory programs against others, our business will be harmed, and the price of our securities could fall.\nRisks Related to our Strategic Partnership with Sarissa Capital\nUnder the Services Agreement with Sarissa Capital, we may rely on Sarissa Capital to assist in our strategic investing activity.\nOn December 11, 2020, we entered into the Services Agreement pursuant to which Sarissa Capital provides substantial assistance to us in connection with our acquisition strategy. Pursuant to the terms of the Services Agreement, and subject to the limitations set forth therein, Sarissa Capital will, among other things: (i) assist Innoviva in the development of an overall acquisition and investment process and strategy; (ii) advise Innoviva on market trends, market dynamics and merger and acquisition activity; (iii) identify potential transaction targets; (iv) assist in due diligence of transaction targets and the negotiation and execution of transactions; (v) advise on the growth and operational plans, performance and integration of target companies once an investment or acquisition is made; and (vi) assist in the identification of director and officer candidates for target companies. The services are provided by Sarissa Capital personnel and we have limited or no ability to control the manner upon which the services are provided. In the event that Sarissa Capital fails to adequately perform the required services, our investment activity operations and financial performance may be negatively impacted.\nOur investment into the Partnership could subject us to various risks and uncertainties, any of which could impact our investment results and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, we have invested our cash reserves in short-term investments and marketable securities, primarily corporate notes, government securities, government agencies, and commercial papers. On December 11, 2020, we entered into the Partnership Agreement and invested $300 million of our cash reserves to be managed by Sarissa Capital as the investment manager to the Partnership.\nWhile we expect that our revenues will continue to be primarily derived from our royalty management business, as a result of this investment, we may derive a material portion of our income from assets managed by Sarissa Capital. The investment strategy of Sarissa Capital will focus on a concentrated portfolio of \u201clong\u201d positions in publicly or privately traded securities (debt or equity) and derivatives of, and other financial instruments related to, each of the foregoing, specifically in the areas of healthcare, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. The risks associated with this investment strategy may be substantially greater than the risks associated with traditional fixed-income investment strategies or other low-yield strategies.\nWe have limited rights to remove the general partner of the Partnership and do not have any right to participate in the management of the Partnership or the investment activity of Sarissa Capital. We are solely dependent on Sarissa Capital\u2019s management of our investment in the Partnership. We cannot provide assurance that Sarissa Capital will be successful in meeting our investment objectives. Unexpected market volatility or losses in the Partnership\u2019s securities portfolio could significantly and negatively affect our investment in the Partnership and therefore our investment results, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, in May 2021, Strategic Partners received a distribution of $110.0 million from the Partnership to provide funding to us for a strategic repurchase of shares held by GSK. Pursuant to the letter agreement entered into between Strategic Partners, the Partnership and Sarissa Capital Fund GP LP on May 20, 2021, Strategic Partners agreed to make additional capital contributions to the Partnership in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of the May 2021 distribution prior to March 31, 2022. Any such capital contribution will reduce the amount of available capital which may impact our ability to execute our strategy in the short term.\nThe Partnership Agreement limits our ability to withdraw our invested funds from the Partnership.\nUnder the terms of the Partnership Agreement, subject to limited exceptions, we are not entitled to withdraw our funds invested in the Partnership until expiration of a \u201clock-up\u201d period. Following the expiration of the lock-up period, we are able to make annual withdrawals subject to 25% gating provision such that we would receive our entire account in the Partnership over four fiscal quarters. Therefore, we are limited in our ability to obtain liquidity with respect to those funds and are further subjects to market fluctuations with respect thereto, particularly given the expected concentrated nature of the Partnership\u2019s portfolio.\nSarissa Capital intends to continue to manage other third party capital and is not required to dedicate any minimum amount of time to the Partnership.\nIn addition to managing the Partnership, Sarissa Capital, its principals and their affiliates may engage in investment and trading activities for their own accounts and/or for the accounts of third parties and is not required to afford the Partnership exclusivity or priority with respect to investment or trading activities. Affiliates of Sarissa Capital manage and expect to continue to manage other client accounts which have objectives similar to the Partnership. The Partnership Agreement does not include any specific obligations or requirements concerning allocation of time, effort or investment opportunities to us or impose any restriction on the nature or timing of investments for accounts that Sarissa Capital or its affiliates may manage.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe price of our securities has been volatile and may continue to be so, and purchasers of our securities could incur substantial losses.\nThe price of our securities has been volatile and may continue to be so. Between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021, the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market varied between $10.92 and $18.97 per share. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the companies\u2019 operating performance, in particular during the last several years. The following factors, in addition to the other risk factors described in this section, may also have a significant impact on the market price of our securities:\n\u2022any adverse developments or results or perceived adverse developments or results with respect to the commercialization of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae with GSK, including, without limitation, if payor coverage is lower than anticipated or if sales of RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae are less than anticipated because of pricing pressure in the respiratory markets targeted by our partnered products or existing or future competition in the markets in which they are commercialized, including competition from existing and new products that are perceived as lower cost or more effective, and our royalty payments are less than anticipated;\n\u2022any positive developments or results or perceived positive developments or results with respect to the commercialization of TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae with GSK, including, if GSK and the respiratory market in general view this triple combination therapy as significantly more beneficial than existing therapies, including RELVAR\u00ae/BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae and ANORO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae;\n\u2022any adverse developments or perceived adverse developments in the field of LABAs, including any change in FDA (or comparable foreign regulatory authority) policy or guidance (such as the pronouncement in February 2010 warning that LABAs should not be used alone in the treatment of asthma and related labeling requirements, the impact of the March 2010 FDA Advisory Committee discussing LABA clinical trial design to evaluate serious asthma outcomes or the FDA\u2019s April 2011 announcement that manufacturers of currently marketed LABAs conduct additional clinical studies comparing the addition of LABAs to inhaled corticosteroids versus inhaled corticosteroids alone);\n\u2022GSK reprioritizing its development or commercial efforts on other products, including TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae or products owned by GSK (such as Advair\u00ae) but that are not partnered with us;\n\u2022the occurrence of a fundamental change triggering a put right of the holders of the Notes or our inability, or perceived inability, to satisfy the obligations under the Notes when they become due;\n\u2022our incurrence of expenses in any particular quarter that are different than market expectations;\n\u2022changes in the treatment paradigm or standards of care for COPD or asthma;\n\u2022the extent to which GSK advances (or does not advance) FF/VI, UMEC/VI and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae, through commercialization in all indications in all major markets;\n\u2022any adverse developments or perceived adverse developments with respect to our relationship with GSK, including, without limitation, disagreements that may arise between us and GSK;\n\u2022announcements by or regarding GSK generally;\n\u2022announcements of patent issuances or denials, technological innovations or new commercial products by GSK;\n\u2022publicity regarding actual or potential study results or the outcome of regulatory review relating to products under development by GSK or other pharmaceutical companies;\n\u2022regulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries, including recent tax reform and the possibility that future presidential administrations and the U.S. Congress may seek to modify or replace PPACA and to implement or pass other reforms to the healthcare system, including proposed related legislation related to the pricing of pharmaceuticals with new healthcare legislation;\n\u2022economic and other external factors beyond our control;\n\u2022sales of stock by us or by our stockholders, including sales by certain of our employees and directors whether or not pursuant to selling plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and\n\u2022relative illiquidity in the public market for our common stock (our five largest stockholders collectively owned approximately 43.7% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2021 based on our review of publicly available filings).\nWe may be unable to or elect not to return capital to our stockholders.\nThe payment of, or continuation of, capital returns to stockholders is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and is dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, execution of our strategic initiatives, general business conditions, tax treatment of capital returns, potential future contractual restrictions contained in our credit agreement and other agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Future capital returns may also be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and our working capital and debt maintenance requirements; legal risks; stock or debt repurchase programs; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. Our capital return programs may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to provide any particular amounts. Our announcement of future capital return programs does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount of debt or equity or number of shares of common stock. A reduction, suspension or change in our capital return programs could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and in Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions include:\n\u2022requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws;\n\u2022restricting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at meetings.\nIn addition, some provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us.\nGeneral Risks Factors\nOur internal computer systems, or third-parties that we work with, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our business.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third-parties with whom we work (including our collaborative partner) are vulnerable to damage or disruption from computer viruses, software bugs, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication, equipment and electrical failures. In the event we or they were to experience any significant system failure, accident or security breach it could cause interruptions in our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, misappropriation of our confidential, or otherwise protected, information and corruption of data.\nAdditionally, California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first \u201cGDPR-like\u201d law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. Having gone into effect January 1, 2020, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA may significantly impact our business activities and require substantial compliance costs that adversely affect business, operating results, prospects and financial condition.\nThus, any access, disclosure or other loss of information, including our data being breached at our partners or third-party providers, could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting or if the interpretations, estimates or judgments utilized in preparing our financial statements prove to be incorrect, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Under the SEC\u2019s current rules, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to report on our internal control over financial reporting. Our testing and our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses and render our internal control over financial reporting ineffective. We have and expect to continue to incur substantial accounting and auditing expense and to expend significant management time in complying with the requirements of Section 404. If we are not able to maintain compliance with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by the SEC, FINRA, The Nasdaq Global Select Market or other regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct any material weaknesses that may be identified or to respond to any regulatory investigations or proceedings.\nWe are also subject to complex tax laws, regulations, accounting principles and interpretations thereof. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to interpret accounting principles and guidance and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our interpretations, estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for the preparation of our financial statements. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) presentation is subject to interpretation by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and various other bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. In the event that one of these bodies disagrees with our accounting recognition, measurement or disclosure or any of our accounting interpretations, estimates or assumptions, it may have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. The need to restate our financial results could, among other potential adverse effects, result in our incurring substantial costs, affect our ability to timely file our periodic reports until such restatement is completed, divert the attention of our management and employees from managing our business, result in material changes to our historical and future financial results, result in investors losing confidence in our operating results, subject us to securities class action litigation, and cause our stock price to decline.\nOur employees or third party providers, or employees or third party providers of our portfolio companies may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by employees, third party providers, or employees or third party providers of our portfolio companies. Misconduct by employees, third party providers, or employees or third party providers of our portfolio companies could include intentional failures to comply with applicable regulations, provide accurate information to regulatory authorities, comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, the health care industry is subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees, third party providers, or employees or third party providers of our portfolio companies, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe have incurred litigation and may incur additional litigation.\nWe have been subject to various legal proceedings, and, in the future, we may be exposed to, or threatened with, litigation, claims and proceedings incident to the ordinary course of, or otherwise in connection with, our business. In addition, agreements entered into by us sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject us to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, we may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase our operating expenses.\nIf one or more legal matters were resolved against us or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against us that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or \u201cFCPA\u201d, as well as the anti-bribery laws of the nations in which we conduct business, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls. In addition, we are subject to the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Our employees or other agents may engage in prohibited conduct without our knowledge under our policies and procedures and the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws that we may be subject to for which we may be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nU.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), was signed into law, significantly reforming the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The TCJA, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system and modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits.\nThe TCJA is a complex revision to the U.S. federal income tax laws with disparate and, in some cases, countervailing impacts on different categories of taxpayers and industries, and will require subsequent rulemaking and interpretation in a number of areas. The long-term impact of the TCJA on the overall economy, the industries in which we operate and our partners business cannot be reliably predicted at this early stage of the new law\u2019s implementation. There can be no assurance that the TCJA will not negatively impact our operating results, financial condition, and future business operations. The estimated impact of the TCJA is based on our management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions, following consultation with our tax advisors, and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on our actual results and our further analysis of the new law. The impact of the TCJA on holders of common stock is uncertain and could be materially adverse. This Annual Report does not discuss any such tax legislation or the manner in which it might affect investors in common stock. Investors should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in common stock.\nThe widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The Company is closely monitoring developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its impact on the Company\u2019s business. It is possible that an extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 90423, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "INVA"}
