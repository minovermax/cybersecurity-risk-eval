RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when making an investment decision.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are subject to government regulation, which may have a negative impact on our businesses, financial position, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal and state regulatory agencies and local governmental bodies. This regulation significantly influences our operating environment and may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers. Many aspects of our operations are regulated, including, but not limited to, construction and operation of facilities, conditions of service, the issuance of securities, and the rates that we can charge customers. We are required to have numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from these agencies to operate our business. Failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations may lead to penalties or customer refunds, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nExisting statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted by federal and state regulatory agencies, or these agencies may adopt new laws and regulations that apply to us. We are unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results of any such actions by these agencies. However, changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may require us to incur additional expenses or change business operations, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe rates, including adjustments determined under riders, that our utilities are allowed to charge for retail and wholesale services are the most important factors influencing our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Rate regulation is premised on providing an opportunity to recover prudently incurred costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, there is no assurance that regulatory commissions will consider all the costs of our utilities to have been prudently incurred. In addition, the regulatory process will not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of such costs or provide for a reasonable return on equity. Certain expense and revenue items are deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by regulators. Future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured, and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for prudence and reasonableness. If recovery of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, regulatory assets would be recognized in current period expense and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur operations are subject to risks beyond our control, including but not limited to, cyber security attacks, terrorist attacks, acts of war, or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information.\nAny future terrorist attack, cyber security attack, and/or act of war affecting our facilities and operations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The energy industry uses sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which control an interconnected system of generation, distribution, and transmission systems shared with third parties. A successful physical or cyber security attack may occur despite our security measures or those that we require our vendors to take, which include compliance with reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection standards. Successful physical and cyber security attacks, including those targeting information systems and electronic control systems used at generating facilities and electric and natural gas transmission, distribution, and storage systems, could severely disrupt our operations and result in loss of service to customers. The risk of such attacks may also increase our capital and operating costs as a result of having to implement increased security measures for protection of our information technology and infrastructure.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders, and employees, who expect that we will adequately protect such information. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of personally identifiable information may cause our business reputation to be adversely impacted, may lead to potentially large costs to notify and protect the impacted persons, and/or may cause us to become subject to legal claims, fines, or penalties, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe costs of repairing damage to our facilities, protecting personally identifiable information, and notifying impacted persons, as well as related legal claims, may not be recoverable in rates, may exceed the insurance limits on our insurance policies, or, in some cases, may not be covered by insurance.\nWe are actively involved with several significant capital projects, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect the cost, timing, and completion of the projects.\nOur utilities are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation, natural gas storage, delivery, and other projects, including projects for environmental compliance and distribution system improvements. In addition, IBS has various capital projects which are primarily related to the development of software applications used to support our utilities.\nAchieving the intended benefits of any large construction project is subject to many uncertainties. These uncertainties include the ability to adhere to established budgets and time frames, the availability of labor and materials at estimated costs, the availability and cost of financing, and weather. There may also be contractor or supplier performance issues or adverse changes in their creditworthiness and difficulties meeting critical regulatory requirements. If construction of commission-approved projects should materially and adversely deviate from the schedules, estimates, and\nprojections on which the approval was based, the applicable commission may deem the additional capital costs as imprudent and disallow recovery of them through rates.\nTo the extent that delays occur, costs become unrecoverable, or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur operations are subject to risks arising from the reliability of our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas infrastructure facilities, and other facilities, as well as the reliability of third-party transmission providers.\nThe operation of electric generation and natural gas and electric distribution facilities involves many risks, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. Potential breakdown or failure may occur due to storms; catastrophic events (explosions, fires, tornadoes, floods, etc.); aging infrastructure; fuel supply or transportation disruptions; accidents; employee labor disputes; construction delays or cost overruns; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material, and/or labor; and performance below expected levels. These events could lead to substantial financial losses. Because our electric generation facilities are interconnected with third-party transmission facilities, the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by events impacting their systems. Unplanned outages at our power plants may reduce our revenues or may require us to incur significant costs by forcing us to operate our higher cost electric generators or purchase replacement power to satisfy our obligations. Insurance, warranties, performance guarantees, or recovery through the regulatory process may not cover any or all of these lost revenues or increased expenses.\nWe are obligated to provide safe and reliable service to customers within our service territories. Meeting this commitment requires significant capital resources. Failure to provide safe and reliable service and failure to meet regulatory reliability standards could adversely affect our operating results through the imposition of penalties and fines or other adverse regulatory outcomes.\nFluctuating commodity prices may impact energy margins and result in changes to liquidity requirements.\nThe margins and liquidity requirements of our businesses are impacted by changes in the forward and current market prices of natural gas, coal, electricity, renewable energy credits, and ancillary services. Changes in price could result in:\n\u2022\nHigher working capital costs, particularly related to natural gas inventory, accounts receivable, and cash collateral postings;\n\u2022\nReduced profitability to the extent that reduced margins, increased bad debt, and interest expense are not recovered through rates;\n\u2022\nHigher rates charged to our customers, which could impact our competitive position;\n\u2022\nReduced demand for energy, which could impact margins and operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nShutting down of generation facilities if the cost of generation exceeds the market price for electricity.\nOur operations are subject to various conditions which can result in fluctuations in the number of customers and their energy use.\nOur operations are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas, which can vary greatly based upon:\n\u2022\nFluctuations in general economic conditions and growth within our service areas;\n\u2022\nWeather conditions; and\n\u2022\nOur customers' continued focus on energy efficiency and ability to meet their own energy needs.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations, compliance with which could be difficult and costly.\nWe are subject to numerous federal and state environmental laws and regulations that affect many aspects of our operations, including future operations. These laws and regulations relate to air emissions (including greenhouse gas emissions), water quality, wastewater discharges, hazardous materials management, and the generation, transport, and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Such laws and regulations require us to implement compliance processes and obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections, and other approvals. Existing laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws and regulations passed, including, but not limited to, rules addressing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide emissions, and the management of coal combustion byproducts, including fly ash.\nFuture regulation may affect the capital expenditures we would make for our generation units or distribution systems, including costs to further limit the greenhouse gas emissions from our operations through control technology. Any such regulation may also create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances and could affect the availability or cost of fossil fuels. The steps we could be required to take to ensure that our facilities are in compliance with any such laws and regulations could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, certain coal-fired electric generating facilities may become uneconomical to run and could result in early retirement of some of our units or may force us to convert the units to an alternative type of fuel. If generation facility owners in the Midwest, including WPS, are forced to retire a significant number of older coal-fired generation facilities, a potential reduction in the region's capacity reserve margin below acceptable risk levels could result. This could impair the reliability of the Midwest portion of the grid, especially during peak demand periods. A reduction in available future capacity could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers' needs.\nOur natural gas delivery systems may generate fugitive gas as a result of normal operations and as a result of excavation, construction, and repair of natural gas delivery systems. Fugitive gas typically vents to the atmosphere and consists primarily of methane. Carbon dioxide is also a byproduct of natural gas consumption. As a result, future legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions could increase the price of natural gas, restrict the use of natural gas, adversely affect our ability to operate our natural gas facilities, and/or reduce natural gas demand.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations can also require us to incur expenditures for cleanup costs, damages arising from contaminated properties, and monitoring obligations. We accrue liabilities and defer costs (recorded as regulatory assets) incurred in connection with our former manufactured gas plant sites. These costs include all recoverable costs incurred to date, management's best estimates of future costs for investigation and remediation, and legal expenses, and are net of amounts recovered by or that may be recovered from insurance or other entities. The ultimate costs to remediate these sites could vary from the amounts currently accrued.\nThere is uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties. Citizen groups that feel environmental regulations are not being sufficiently enforced by environmental regulatory agencies may also bring citizen enforcement actions against us. Such actions could seek penalties, injunctive relief, and costs of litigation. There is also a risk that private citizens may bring lawsuits to recover environmental damages they believe they have incurred.\nCompliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may result in increased capital, operating, and other costs. Compliance could also impact future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recoverable through regulated rates. Noncompliance could result in fines, penalties, and injunctive measures negatively affecting our operations and facilities.\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions could negatively affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital, and/or grow or sustain our current business. Cost of capital and disruptions, uncertainty, and/or volatility in the financial markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, as well as exert downward pressure on our stock price.\nHaving access to the credit and capital markets, at a reasonable cost, is necessary for us to fund our operations and capital requirements. The capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our businesses that is not otherwise provided from operating cash flows and also supports our ability to provide credit support for our subsidiaries. Disruptions, uncertainty, and/or volatility in those markets could increase our cost of capital or limit the availability of capital. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, we may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities, and/or bear an increased cost of capital. This, in turn, could impact our ability to grow or sustain our current businesses, cause a reduction in earnings, result in a credit rating downgrade, and/or limit our ability to sustain our current common stock dividend level.\nA reduction in our or our subsidiaries' credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe cannot be sure that any of our or our subsidiaries' credit ratings will not be lowered by a rating agency if, in the rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Any downgrade could:\n\u2022\nRequire the payment of higher interest rates in future financings and possibly reduce the potential pool of creditors;\n\u2022\nIncrease borrowing costs under certain existing credit facilities;\n\u2022\nLimit access to the commercial paper market;\n\u2022\nLimit the availability of adequate credit support for our subsidiaries\u2019 operations; and\n\u2022\nRequire provision of additional credit assurance, including cash margin calls, to contract counterparties.\nAny change in our authority to sell electricity at market-based rates may impact earnings.\nThe FERC has authorized WPS to sell electricity in the wholesale market at market prices. WPS must file an updated market power analysis with the FERC at least every three years to demonstrate it does not possess market power in that region. The FERC retains the authority to modify, revoke, or rescind this market-based rate authority. If the FERC determines that the relevant market is not workably competitive, that WPS possesses market power, that WPS is not charging just and reasonable rates, or that WPS has not complied with the rules required in order to maintain market-based rates, the FERC may require WPS to sell power at a price based upon the costs incurred in producing the power, or otherwise revoke or rescind its authority in that market. Our revenues and profit margins may be negatively affected by any reduction by the FERC of the rates WPS may receive, or otherwise by any revocation or rescission of such authority.\nCounterparties and customers may not meet their obligations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements who owe us money, electricity, natural gas, or other commodities or services will not be able to perform their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at then-current market prices or we may be unable to meet all of our customers' natural gas and electric requirements unless or until alternative supply arrangements are put in place. In such event, we may incur losses, or our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on coal for much of our electric generating capacity. While we have coal supply and transportation contracts in place, we cannot assure that the counterparties to these agreements will be able to fulfill their obligations to supply coal to us. If we are unable to obtain our coal requirements under our coal supply and transportation contracts, we may be forced to reduce generation at our coal-fired units and replace this lost generation through additional power purchases in the MISO market. There is no guarantee that we would be able to fully recover any increased costs in rates. Our electric generation frequently exceeds our customer load. When this occurs, we generally sell the excess generation into the MISO market. If we are unable to run our lower cost units, we may lose the ability to engage in these opportunity sales, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur customers may experience financial problems. Financially distressed customers might default on their obligations to us or reduce their future use of our products and services. We cannot assure that such defaults or reductions in use of our products and services will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to use tax credit, net operating loss, and/or charitable contribution carryforwards.\nWe have significantly reduced our consolidated federal and state income tax liability in the past through tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions available under the applicable tax codes. We have not fully used the allowed tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions in our previous tax filings. We may not be able to fully use the tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions available as carryforwards if our future federal and state taxable income and related income tax liability is insufficient to permit their use. In addition, any future disallowance of some or all of those tax credit, net operating loss, or charitable contribution carryforwards as a result of legislative change or adverse determination by one of the applicable taxing jurisdictions could materially affect our tax obligations and financial results.\nPoor investment performance of retirement plan investments and other factors impacting retirement plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe have employee benefit plans that cover substantially all of our employees and retirees. Our cost of providing these benefit plans varies depending upon actual plan experience and assumptions concerning the future. These assumptions include earnings on and/or valuations of plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, estimated withdrawals by retirees, and required or voluntary contributions to the plans. Depending on the investment performance over time and other factors impacting our costs, we could be required to make larger contributions in the future to fund these plans. These additional funding obligations could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Changes made to the plans may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs.\nWe have recorded goodwill and other intangibles that could become impaired.\nTo the extent the value of goodwill or other intangibles becomes impaired, we have had to, and in the future, may also be required to, incur material noncash charges relating to such impairments. These impairment charges could have a material impact on our financial results.\nAs a holding company, we rely on the earnings of our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations.\nWe are a holding company, and our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Substantially all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. Consequently, our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us, whether through dividends or otherwise. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any of our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose or for the payment of dividends on our common stock. The ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us depends on their earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, general financial condition, and regulatory limitations. In addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay dividends to us depends on any statutory and/or contractual restrictions, which may include requirements to maintain levels of debt or equity ratios, working capital, or other assets. Our utility subsidiaries are regulated by various state utility commissions, which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger with Wisconsin Energy Corporation (Wisconsin Energy)\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively affect our share price and our future businesses and financial results.\nCompletion of the merger is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that approval by governmental agencies will not be obtained or that certain other closing conditions will not be satisfied. If the merger is not completed, our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe may have to pay certain significant costs relating to the merger without receiving the benefits of the merger;\n\u2022\nThe attention of our management may have been diverted to the merger rather than to our own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nThere may have been a potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company;\n\u2022\nWe would have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business which may have prevented us from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing certain business opportunities while the merger was pending;\n\u2022\nOur share price may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption by the market that the merger will be completed;\n\u2022\nThere may be adverse consequences to our business and our relations with governmental agencies arising out of our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for the merger if such efforts are unsuccessful;\n\u2022\nWe may suffer adverse business consequences relating to the uncertainty caused by the potential merger, including a potential loss of customers; and\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger.\nIn addition, ten purported class action and/or derivative lawsuits were filed against us, members of our board of directors, and\nWisconsin Energy. These lawsuits sought, among other things, an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the merger. As disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 12, 2014, counsel for the parties to each of these lawsuits entered into a memorandum of understanding on November 12, 2014, pursuant to which, among other things, we and Wisconsin Energy agreed to make the disclosures concerning the merger that were set forth in that Form 8-K. The memorandum of understanding further provides for the dismissal with prejudice of all remaining actions and the release of any and all claims, including derivative claims, concerning the merger, subject to court approval after notice to the proposed class of our shareholders. All actions are stayed pending execution of definitive settlement documentation and a decision by the relevant courts regarding approval of the proposed settlement. While we believe the relevant courts will approve the parties\u2019 proposed settlement, we cannot make any assurances as to such approval. As discussed further below, the courts\u2019 failure to approve such settlement could result in the resumption of litigation seeking, among other things, to prevent the consummation of the merger.\nThe occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results.\nWe and Wisconsin Energy may be unable to obtain the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger or, in order to do so,\nwe and Wisconsin Energy may be required to comply with material restrictions or conditions that may negatively affect the combined company after the merger is completed or cause us to abandon the merger.\nCompletion of the merger is contingent upon, among other things, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. For us, this consists of filings with and approvals of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), notice to, and the consent and approval of, the FERC, pre-approvals of license transfers with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), notice to and approval of the ICC and the MPSC, and, to the extent required, notice to and approval of the MPUC. In the case of Wisconsin Energy, this consists of filings with and approvals of the NYSE, notice to, and the consent and approval of, the FERC, pre-approvals of license transfers with the FCC, notice to and approval of the PSCW, the ICC, and the MPSC, and, if required or advisable, the MPUC. We are a party to a contested settlement agreement with the MPSC staff and all but one of the parties in the MPSC approval docket. The settling parties agree that the MPSC should grant approval of the merger contingent on additional transactions, including the sale of the Presque Isle facility currently owned by Wisconsin Energy, as well as the Michigan electric distribution assets of Wisconsin Energy and WPS, to UPPCO. The asset sales require additional approvals, including the MPSC, PSCW, FERC, FCC, and Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, as well as the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. We can provide no assurance that all required regulatory authorizations, approvals, or consents will be obtained, or that they will not contain terms, conditions, or restrictions that would be detrimental to the combined company after completion of the merger.\nUncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company following the merger.\nWe and Wisconsin Energy are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our respective business plans. The combined company's success after the merger will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of us and Wisconsin Energy. Current and prospective employees of us and Wisconsin Energy may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the merger, which may materially adversely affect the ability of each of us to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees of us and Wisconsin Energy.\nWe are subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending that could adversely affect our financial results.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, suppliers, and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter. Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to completion of the merger, as current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. Uncertainties could also cause customers, suppliers, and others who deal with us to seek changes to our existing business relationships.\nThe pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration of us and Wisconsin Energy may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management's attention away from ongoing business, and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, could affect our financial results and/or the financial results of the combined company.\nIn addition, the merger agreement restricts us, without Wisconsin Energy's consent, from making certain acquisitions and dispositions and taking other specified actions while the merger is pending. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.\nBecause the merger consideration is fixed and the market price of shares of Wisconsin Energy common stock will fluctuate, our shareholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive.\nUpon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of our common stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.128 shares of Wisconsin Energy common stock and $18.58 in cash. Based on the closing price of Wisconsin Energy common stock on June 20, 2014, the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger, the aggregate value of the merger consideration was approximately $5.8 billion. The number of shares of Wisconsin Energy common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger agreement for each share of our common stock is fixed and will not change to reflect changes in the market price of Wisconsin Energy or our common stock. Because the exchange ratio will not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the market value of either company's common stock, the market value of the Wisconsin Energy common stock issued in connection with the merger and our common stock surrendered in connection with the merger, may be higher or lower than the values of those shares on earlier dates. Stock price changes may result from, among other things, changes in the business, operations, or prospects of Wisconsin Energy or us prior to or following the merger; litigation or regulatory considerations; general business, market, industry, or economic conditions; and other factors both within and beyond the control of Wisconsin Energy and us. Neither we nor Wisconsin Energy is permitted to terminate the merger agreement solely because of changes in the market price of either company's common stock.\nThe merger agreement precludes us from pursuing alternatives to the merger.\nUnder the merger agreement, we are restricted from pursuing or entering into alternative transactions in lieu of the merger. In general, unless and until the merger agreement is terminated, we are restricted from, among other things, soliciting, initiating, knowingly encouraging, inducing, or knowingly facilitating a competing acquisition proposal from any person. These provisions would discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing such an acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the consideration proposed to be received or realized in the merger. As a result of these restrictions, we cannot enter into an agreement with respect to a more favorable alternative transaction, prior to the termination of the merger agreement, without incurring potentially significant liability to Wisconsin Energy.\nIf completed, the merger may not achieve its intended results, and we and Wisconsin Energy may be unable to successfully integrate our operations.\nWe and Wisconsin Energy entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in various benefits, including, among other things, accretion to the combined company's earnings per share in the first full calendar year following completion of the merger. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022\nWhether our business and the business of Wisconsin Energy can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner;\n\u2022\nWhether U.S. federal and state public utility authorities, whose approval is required to complete the merger, impose conditions on the completion of the merger which have an adverse effect on the combined company;\n\u2022\nGeneral market and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nGeneral competitive factors in the marketplace; and\n\u2022\nHigher than expected costs required to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nIt is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees; the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, processes, and systems; or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements. Any of these could adversely affect the combined company's ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The combined company's results of operations could also be adversely affected by any issues attributable to either company's operations that arise or are based on events or actions that occur prior to the closing of the merger. The companies may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. The integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect the combined company's future business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nPending litigation against us and Wisconsin Energy that is the subject of a proposed settlement could nevertheless result in an injunction preventing completion of the merger, the payment of damages in the event the merger is completed, and/or may adversely affect the combined company's business, financial condition, or results of operations following the merger.\nIn connection with the merger, purported shareholders of ours filed putative stockholder class action and/or derivative lawsuits against us, our directors, and Wisconsin Energy seeking to enjoin the merger. As discussed above, those lawsuits are currently stayed pending finalization of proposed settlement documentation and a decision by the relevant courts regarding approval of the proposed settlement. Nevertheless, one of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no law or judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction shall be in effect that, and no suit, action, or other proceeding shall be pending before any governmental entity in which such governmental entity seeks to impose any legal restraint that, prevents, makes illegal, or prohibits the consummation of the merger. Consequently, if the proposed settlement is not approved, the litigation may recommence and one of the plaintiffs may be successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting us or Wisconsin Energy from consummating the merger on the agreed-upon terms. In that event, the injunction may prevent the merger from being completed within the expected timeframe, or at all. Furthermore, if the proposed settlement is not approved and defendants are not able to resolve these lawsuits, the lawsuits could result in substantial costs to us, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is completed may adversely affect the combined company's business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nDelays in completing the merger may substantially reduce the expected benefits of the merger.\nSatisfying the conditions to, and completion of, the merger may take longer than, and could cost more than, we and Wisconsin Energy expect. Any delay in completing or any additional conditions imposed in order to complete the merger may materially adversely affect the benefits that we and Wisconsin Energy expect to achieve from the merger and the integration of our respective businesses. In addition, we or Wisconsin Energy may terminate the merger agreement if the merger is not completed by June 22, 2015, except that such date may be extended to December 22, 2015 if the only unsatisfied conditions to the completion of the merger are those regarding the receipt of required regulatory approvals.\nWe will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the merger.\nWe and Wisconsin Energy expect to incur non-recurring expenses totaling approximately $60 million in connection with the merger. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of the integration of our businesses. We cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term, or at all.", "PERMNO": 25099, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "WEC3"}
