{"cik": "1004989", "company": "SPAR GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in SGRP's common stock (\"SGRP Common Stock\") involves a high degree of risk and is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, cautions, circumstances and other factors (\"Risks\") that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected or otherwise expected in any forward-looking statements or other information (see Forward-Looking Statements immediately preceding Part I, above).\nThe following are some of the important Risks faced by the Company, but they are not all of the Risks facing the Company. Those Risks listed below are in addition to the Risks and other information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, the Proxy Statement and the Company's other SEC Reports, and all of them should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business. If any of those Risks occur or become more significant (in whole or in part), or if any presently unknown Risk occurs, it could materially and adversely affect the results, actions, levels of activity, performance, achievements or condition of the Company (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition).\nYou should carefully review and consider the following Risks as well as those made, contained or noted in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report, the Proxy Statement or other applicable SEC Report, but you should not place undue reliance on any of them. All forward-looking statements and other information attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly subject to and qualified by all such Risks.\nThose Risks reflect our expectations, views and assumptions only as of the date of this Annual Report, and the Company does not intend, assume any obligation, or promise to publicly update or revise any such Risk or information (in whole or in part), whether as a result of new information, new or worsening Risks or uncertainties, changed circumstances, future events, recognition, or otherwise.\nDependence on Largest Customer and Large Retail Chains\nAs discussed above in Company's Customer Base, the Company currently does not have a significant customer concentration. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain new business, renew existing client contracts at the same or higher levels of pricing or that our current clients will not turn to competitors, cease operations, elect to self-operate or terminate contracts with us. In addition, consolidation by the Company's clients in the industries it serves could result in our losing business if the combined entity chooses a different provider, and the bankruptcy of a significant customer could result in the loss of substantial receivables or the return of substantial recent payments. The loss of any of its customers, the loss of the ability to provide merchandising and marketing services in those chains, the loss of substantial receivables or payments, or the failure to attract new large clients could significantly decrease the Company's revenues and such decreased revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nDependence on Trend Towards Outsourcing\nThe business and growth of the Company depends in large part on the continued trend toward outsourcing of merchandising and marketing services, which the Company believes has resulted from the consolidation of retailers and manufacturers, as well as the desire to seek outsourcing specialists to reduce fixed operation expenses and concentrate internal staff on customer service and sales. There can be no assurance that this trend in outsourcing will continue, as companies may elect to perform such services internally. A significant change in the direction of this trend generally, or a trend in the retail, manufacturing or business services industry not to use, or to reduce the use of, outsourced marketing services such as those provided by the Company, could significantly decrease the Company's revenues and such decreased revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nDependence on Retailers with Physical Stores\nRetailers with physical store locations are facing increasing consolidation and competition from virtual stores. Some retailers with physical stores have failed, others are struggling, and others are merging in this highly competitive environment. Although the Company's merchandising services help physical retailers in successfully competing against virtual stores, and the Company provides assembly and other services utilized by online retailers, the Company's business and growth depends in large part on the continuing need for in-store merchandising of products and the continuing success of retailers with physical store locations. There can be no assurance that the in-store merchandising of products will increase or even continue at current levels or that retailers with physical store locations will continue to compete successfully in those stores, and some retailers are shifting their sales focus to their virtual online stores. A significant decrease in such need for in-store merchandising or success of such physical stores could significantly decrease the Company's revenues and such decreased revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nFailure to Successfully Compete\nThe merchandising and marketing services industry is highly competitive and the Company has competitors that are larger (or part of larger holding companies) and may be better financed. In addition, the Company competes with: (i) a large number of relatively small enterprises with specific client, channel or geographic coverage; (ii) the internal merchandising and marketing operations of its existing and prospective clients; (iii) independent brokers; and (iv) smaller regional providers. Remaining competitive in the highly competitive merchandising and marketing services industry requires that the Company monitor and respond to trends in all industry sectors. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to anticipate and respond successfully to such trends in a timely manner. If the Company is unable to successfully compete, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nIf certain competitors were to combine into integrated merchandising and marketing services companies, or additional merchandising and marketing service companies were to enter into this market, or existing participants in this industry were to become more competitive, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nRisks of Losses and Financial Covenant Violations\nIn the past, the Company has suffered operating losses and may suffer operating losses in the future. In addition, certain one-time charges and adverse operating results during 2017 and 2018 have resulted in the Company being in default of certain of its financial covenants.\nThe Company changed its domestic lender in April 2019 and entered into a new credit facility with increased availability and improved financial and other covenants. If the Company had this new credit facility in place at December 31, 2018, the Company would have been in compliance of all its new domestic lender's bank covenants. See Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 4 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Credit Facilities - North Mill Credit Facility, below. There can be no assurances that in the future: that the Company will be profitable; that the Company will not violate covenants of its current or future credit facilities; that if it does violate them, that the Company's lenders will waive any violations of such covenants; that the Company will continue to have adequate lines of credit; or that the Company will continue to have sufficient availability under its lines of credit. Accordingly, minimal profitability by the Company, additional one-time charges, and changes in the composition and quality of its borrowing base (see Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- Legal Matters, below.), as well as any failure to maintain sufficient availability or lines of credit from the Company's lenders (which may involve their subjective judgment), could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nVariability of Operating Results and Uncertainty in Client Revenue\nThe Company has experienced and, in the future, may experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results. Factors that may cause the Company's quarterly operating results to vary from time to time and may result in reduced revenue and profits include: (i) the number of active client projects; (ii) seasonality of client products; (iii) client delays, changes and cancellations in projects; (iv) staffing requirements, indemnifications, risk allocations, primary insurance coverages, intellectual property claims, and other contractual provisions and concessions demanded by clients that are unilateral, unreasonable and very time consuming to review and attempt to negotiate; (v) the timing requirements of client projects; (vi) the completion of major client projects; (vii) the timing of new engagements; (viii) the timing of personnel cost increases; (ix) service locations and conditions with higher than contemplated personnel costs (remote areas, higher minimum wages, higher skill sets required, etc.); and (x) the loss of major clients. In addition, the Company is subject to revenue or profit uncertainties resulting from factors such as unprofitable client work (see below) and the failure of clients to pay. These revenue fluctuations could materially and adversely affect the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nRisks of Unprofitable Services\nThe Company has agreed, and in the future may agree, from time to time to perform services for its clients that become unprofitable even though the Company expected to make a profit when agreeing to perform them. The Company's services for a particular client or project may be or become unprofitable due to mistakes or changes in circumstance, including (without limitation) any (i) mistakes or omissions made in investigating, evaluating or understanding any relevant circumstance, requirement or request of the Company's client or any aspect of the prospective services or their inherent problems, (ii) mistakes made in pricing, planning or performing the prospective service, (iii) service non-performance, or free re-performance, (iv) changes in cost, personnel, regulations or other performance circumstances, (v) service locations and conditions with higher than contemplated personnel costs (remote areas, higher minimum wages, higher skill sets required, etc.); or (vi) costs of settling or defending indemnifications, risk allocations, primary insurance coverages, intellectual property claims, or other contractual provisions or concessions. Unprofitable services could reduce the Company's net revenues and, if material in gross amount or degree of unprofitability, could materially and adversely affect the Company or its actual, expected, performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nFailure to Develop New Services\nA key element of the Company's growth strategy is the development and sale of new services. While several new services are under current development, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully develop and market new services. The Company's inability or failure to devise useful merchandising or marketing services or to complete the development or implementation of a particular service for use on a large scale, or the failure of such services to achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect the Company's ability to achieve a significant part of its growth strategy and the absence of such growth could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected and could limit the Company's ability to significantly increase its revenues and profits.\nReturn Risks on Software Capital Expenditures\nThe Company has made and will continue to make significant investments in improving its existing Global Technology Systems and developing new software, applications and systems, which is a complex and lengthy process and totaled $1.3 and $1.0 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, for capitalized software improvement and development. The Company may not be able to charge its clients for such improvements or otherwise recover its costs, and new developments may never become marketable, chargeable or profitable. However, a failure to improve its existing Global Technology Systems or develop new software, applications or systems could result in a loss of clients.\nThe failure by the Company to successfully improve its existing Global Technology Systems or develop new software, applications or systems (including unrecovered development costs or client attrition) could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nInability to Identify, Acquire and Successfully Integrate Acquisitions\nAnother key component of the Company's growth strategy is the acquisition of businesses across the United States and worldwide that offer similar merchandising or marketing services. The successful implementation of this strategy depends upon the Company's ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, finance the acquisition and consolidate and integrate their operations successfully with those of the Company. There can be no assurance that such candidates will be available or, if such candidates are available, that the price will be attractive or that the Company will be able to identify, acquire, finance, consolidate or integrate such businesses successfully. In addition, in pursuing such acquisition opportunities, the Company may compete with other entities with similar growth strategies; these competitors may be larger and have greater financial and other resources than the Company. Competition for these acquisition targets could also result in increased prices of acquisition targets and/or a diminished pool of companies available for acquisition.\nThe successful integration of these acquisitions also involves a number of additional risks, including: (i) conflicts between the clients of the acquired business and the clients of the Company; (ii) the inability to retain the clients of the acquired business; (iii) the lingering effects of poor client relations or service performance by the acquired business, which also may negatively affect the Company's existing business; (iv) the inability to retain over the long term the desirable management, key personnel and other employees of the acquired business; (v) the inability to fully realize the desired efficiencies and economies of scale; (vi) the inability to establish, implement or police the Company's existing standards, controls, procedures and policies on the acquired business; (vii) the diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of the Company to acquisition-related matters; and (viii) exposure to client, employee and other legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition. In addition, any acquired business could perform significantly worse than expected.\nThe inability to identify, acquire, finance and successfully integrate such merchandising or marketing services business could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nUncertainty of Financing for, and Dilution Resulting from, Future Acquisitions and Settlements\nThe timing, size and success of acquisition and litigation settlement efforts and any associated capital commitments cannot be readily predicted. Future acquisitions and litigation settlements may be financed by issuing shares of the SGRP Common Stock, cash, or a combination thereof. If the SGRP Common Stock does not maintain a sufficient market value, or if potential acquisition candidates or litigants are otherwise unwilling to accept the SGRP Common Stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses or settlement of their litigation, the Company may be required to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financings. To the extent the SGRP Common Stock is used for all or a portion of the consideration to be paid for future acquisitions or legal settlements, dilution may be experienced by existing stockholders. A \"super majority\" vote of at least 75% of all SGRP directors is now required for any SGRP stock issuance of more than 500,000 SGRP shares (other than pursuant to stockholder approved plans) and such issuance can be blocked by any two directors representing the Majority Stockholders. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional financing it may need for its acquisitions or litigation settlements on terms that the Company deems acceptable. Failure to obtain such capital would materially and adversely affect the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nReliance on the Internet and Third Party Vendors\nThe Company relies on its Global Technology Systems for (among other things) the scheduling, tracking, coordination and reporting of its merchandising and marketing services. In addition to proprietary software and applications of the Company, the Global Technology Systems uses and relies upon software (including operating system, office, exchange, data base and server programs) licensed and hardware purchased or leased from third parties and internet and telecommunication services provided by third parties, which third party software, hardware and internet and telecommunication services may not continue to be available at all or (if available) at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms. Any defect, error or other performance failure in such third-party software, hardware or service also could result in a defect, error or performance failure in our client services. Systems can experience excess traffic and related inefficiencies, from increased demand or otherwise, as well as increased cyberattacks by hackers and other saboteurs. To the extent that systems experience increased demands on current capacity and for additional capacity from (among other things) an increase in the numbers of users, frequency or duration of use, bandwidth requirements of software, applications and users (including the increasing demand from the Company's clients for data-intensive as-serviced pictures from the Field Specialists), or internet cyberattacks, there can be no assurance that the Company's technological systems and third party software, hardware and internet and telecommunication providers will continue to be able to support the demands placed on them by such increased demand or negative events.\nThe Company relies on third-party vendors to provide its internet and telecommunication network access and other services used in its business, and the Company has no control over such third-party providers. Additionally, a cybersecurity breach that results in unauthorized access to sensitive consumer or corporate information contained in these systems may adversely affect the Company's reputation and lead to claims against it. Such claims could include identity theft or other similar fraud-related claims and claims related to violations of applicable data privacy laws. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to the Company's operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to the Company's data, or results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to the Company's reputation, affect its relationships with its customers, lead to claims against it and ultimately harm its business. In addition, the Company may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nAny such software, hardware or service unavailability or unreasonable pricing or terms, defect, error or other performance failure in such third-party software, hardware or service, increased capacity demands, disruption in services, security breach or protective measures could increase the Company's costs of operation and reduce its efficiency and performance, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nEconomic and Retail Uncertainty\nThe markets in which the Company operates are cyclical and subject to the effects of economic downturns. The current political, social and economic conditions, including the impact of terrorism on consumer and business behavior, make it difficult for the Company, its vendors and its clients to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Substantially all of the Company's key clients are either retailers or those seeking to do product merchandising at retailers. Should the retail industry experience a significant economic downturn, the resultant reduction in product sales could significantly decrease the Company's revenues. The Company also has risks associated with its clients changing their business plans and/or reducing their marketing budgets in response to economic conditions, which could also significantly decrease the Company's revenues. Such revenue decreases could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nRisks Associated with Furniture and Other Related Assembly Services\nThe Company's technicians assemble furniture and other products in the stores, homes and offices of customers. Working at a customer's store, home or office could give rise to claims against the Company for errors, omissions or misconduct by those technicians, including (without limitation) harassment, personal injury, death, damage to or theft of customer property, or other civil or criminal misconduct by such technicians. Claims also could be made against the Company as a result of its involvement in such assembly services due to (among other things) product assembly errors and omissions, product defects, deficiencies, breakdowns or collapse, products that are not merchantable or fit for their particular purpose, products that do not conform to published specifications or satisfy customer expectations, or products that cause personal injury, death or property damage, in each case whether actual, alleged or perceived by customers, and irrespective of how much time may have passed since such assembly. If such claims are asserted and adversely determined against the Company, then to the extent such claims are not covered by indemnification from the product's seller or manufacturer or by insurance, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nRisks Associated with Audit Services\nThe auditing services industry is highly competitive and the Company has competitors that are larger (or part of larger holding companies) and may be better financed. In addition, the Company competes with: (i) a large number of relatively small enterprises with specific client, channel or geographic coverage; (ii) the internal auditing operations of its existing and prospective clients; and (iii) smaller regional providers. Remaining competitive in the highly competitive auditing services industry requires that the Company monitor and respond to trends in all industry sectors. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to anticipate and respond successfully to such trends in a timely manner. If the Company is unable to successfully compete, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nDependence Upon and Risks of Services Provided by Third Party Independent Contractors and Related Litigation\nThe success of the Company's domestic business is dependent upon the successful execution and administration of its domestic field services through the services of field merchandising, auditing, assembly and other field personnel (each a \"Field Specialist\"), substantially all of whom are provided to the Company and engaged by independent third parties and located, scheduled, deployed and administered domestically through the services of local, regional, district and other personnel (each a \"Field Administrator\"), and substantially all of the Field Administrators are in turn are employed by other independent third parties.\nPrior to July 2018, substantially all of the services of the Field Specialists were supplied to the Company by SPAR Business Services, Inc. (\"SBS\"), the Company's affiliate. Due to (among other things) the Clothier Determination and the ongoing proceedings against SBS (see SBS Clothier Litigation, SBS Field Specialist Litigation and SBS Bankruptcy, under the caption Legal Proceedings, below), SBS' continued higher charges, and the Company's identification of an experienced Independent Field Vendor who would provide comparable services on substantially better terms, the Company terminated the services of SBS effective July 27, 2018, and the Company has engaged that Independent Field Vendor to replace those field services previously provided by SBS (other than in California, where the Company is using its own employees). Effective August 1, 2018, the Company also has engaged the Independent Field Administrator (see below) on substantially better terms to replace those Field Administrator services formerly provided by SPAR Administrative Services, Inc. (\"SAS\"), an affiliate of SBS.\nThe appropriateness of SBS' treatment of its Field Specialists as independent contractors had been periodically subject to legal review or challenge (both currently and historically) by various states and others. See Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies - SBS Bankruptcy, SBS Field Specialist Litigation SBS Clothier Litigation, SGRP Hogan Litigation, and SBS and SGRP Litigation Generally, below. As provided in SBS' Prior Agreement, the Company is not obligated or liable, and the Company has not otherwise agreed and does not currently intend, to reimburse SBS for any judgment or similar amount (including any damages, settlement, or related tax, penalty, or interest) in any legal review, challenge or other proceeding against or involving SBS, and the Company does not believe it has ever done so (other than in insignificant nuisance amounts). See Note 10 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions - Domestic Related Party Services, below.\nSBS repeatedly disputed the right of the Company and SGRP's Audit Committee to review and decide whether the reimbursement of any related party defense and other expense reimbursements was in the best interests of the Company. See Note 10 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions - Domestic Related Party Services, below. As a result of SGRP's separate settlement of the Clothier Case, on June 13, 2018, the Company gave SBS notice that it would no longer reimburse any such legal expenses related to this legal action, and in connection with the termination of SBS' services, which ceased after July 2018, the Company advised SBS that the Company would no longer reimburse any SBS legal defense expenses. See Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- SBS Clothier Litigation, below.\nThe Company received no services from SBS or SAS after the termination of their respective services took effect. Furthermore, even though SBS was solely responsible for its operations, methods and legal compliance, in connection with any proceedings against SBS, SBS may claim that the Company is somehow liable for any judgment or similar amount imposed against SBS and pursue that claim with litigation. The Company does not believe there is any basis for such claims and would defend them vigorously. There can be no assurance that plaintiffs or someone else will not claim that the Company is liable (under applicable law, through reimbursement or indemnification, or otherwise) for any such judgment or similar amount imposed against SBS, or that the Company will be able to successfully defend any claim. Any imposition of liability on the Company for any such amount could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected. See Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- Legal Matters, below.\nAs a result of SBS filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (see Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- SBS Bankruptcy, below), there can be no assurance that SBS will ever be able to fully pay any amounts owed to the Company by SBS and any damage awards resulting from any legal determination adverse to SBS that may result in third party creditors seeking payment from the Company in connection with SBS's bankruptcy case. Any imposition of such liability on the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nThe Company had utilized the services of SBS to support its in-store merchandising needs in California and SBSs' independent contractor classifications had been held invalid in the Clothier Determination (see Note 6 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- SBS Field Specialist Litigation and SBS Clothier Litigation, below) and in part as a result of the Clothier Determination (see Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters - Clothier Case, below), the Company determined, with the approval of SGRP's Audit Committee and Board of Directors, and began in May of 2018 to shift to an all employee servicing model for Field Specialists to support the performance of the Company's services in California for clients in this critical market and nationally for certain domestic clients that are requiring the Company to use employees as Field Specialists. Management currently estimates that the potential incremental annual cost of this change in California from third party independent contractors to Company employees is between approximately $275,000 and $325,000.\nCommencing in and since August 2018, the Company engaged an experienced independent vendor (the \"Independent Field Vendor\") under contract and license to supply the Company with the services of such vendor's Field Specialists (other than in California, where the Company is using its own employees). The Independent Field Vendor has other significant customers in addition to the Company, performed service for them for years preceding the Company's engagement, and continues to perform service for them. Additionally, commencing in and since August 2018 the Company engaged another independent vendor (the \"Independent Field Administrator\") under contract and license to provide the Company with the services of such vendor's Field Administrators. The services provided by the Independent Field Vendor and the Independent Field Administrator to the Company in the United States are material and there are no assurances that the Company could (if necessary under the circumstances) replace the Field Specialists and Field Administrators currently provided by the Independent Field Vendor and Independent Field Administrator, respectively, in sufficient time to perform its client obligations or at such favorable rates in the event the Independent Field Vendor or the Independent Field Administrator no longer performed those services.\nThe Company believes that its business model of executing its services domestically (other than in California, where the Company is using its own employees) through independent contractors provided by others is equally effective but inherently less costly than doing so with employees, both under applicable tax and employment laws and otherwise. However, the Company continues to reevaluate its business model of using third party independent contractors as Field Specialists outside of California in light of changing client requirements and legal and regulatory environments and intends to begin testing an employee based model nationally for certain domestic clients that are requiring the Company to use employees as Field Specialists. The Company expects that using employees as Field Specialists in additional states will cost substantially more than using third party independent contractors for the same services. See Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters, and Note 10 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions - Domestic Related Party Services, below.\nThe Independent Field Vendor also utilizes independent contractors to the extent permitted by applicable law, and it is possible that the appropriateness of its treatment of Field Specialists as independent contractors will be periodically subject to legal review or challenge by various states and others. The Company in its discretion may review and decide each request by the Independent Field Vendor for reimbursement of its legal defense expenses on a case-by-case basis, including the relative costs and benefits to the Company of doing so, but the Independent Field Vendor has agreed that the Company has no obligation to do so.\nAlthough to the Company's knowledge its Independent Field Vendor is not involved in any material proceeding involving its independent contractors, any material legal defense costs of the Independent Field Vendor approved for reimbursement by the Company, or if SBS, SAS, the Independent Field Vendor, any related party or any third party claims that the Company is liable for any legal expenses incurred by such parties in defending any claim or satisfying any judgment against such parties, any judicial determination that the Company is liable for any judgment against the Independent Field Vendor, Independent Field Administrator, SBS, SAS, any related party or other vendor or service provider (in whole or in part), any decrease in the Independent Field Administrator's or the Independent Field Vendor's performance (quality or otherwise), any inability by the Independent Field Administrator or the Independent Field Vendor to execute the services for the Company or to continue with its present business model, or any increase in the Company's use of employees (rather than independent contractors) as its domestic Field Specialists, in each case in whole or in part, could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nCurrent material and potentially material proceedings involving independent contractors against SBS and, in one instance, the Company are further described under the caption Legal Proceedings, below and in Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- Legal Matters, below.\nPotential Conflicts with Affiliates\nSBS, SAS, and SPAR InfoTech, Inc. (\"Infotech\"), have provided services from time to time to the Company and are related parties and affiliates of SGRP. SBS, SAS and Infotech are not under the control or part of the consolidated Company and none of them was ever included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. SBS is an affiliate because it is owned by Robert G. Brown, and, through November 2018, was also owned in part by William H. Bartels. SAS is an affiliate because it is owned by William H. Bartels and certain relatives of Robert G. Brown or entities controlled by them (each of whom are considered affiliates of the Company for related party purposes). Infotech is an affiliate because it is owned by Robert G. Brown and certain relatives of Robert G. Brown or entities controlled by them (each of whom are considered affiliates of the Company for related party purposes). Mr. Brown and Mr. Bartels are the Majority Stockholders (see below) and founders of SGRP's predecessor, Mr. Brown was Chairman and an officer and director of SGRP through May 3, 2018 (when he retired), and Mr. Bartels was and continues to be Vice Chairman and a director and officer of SGRP. Mr. Brown and family members also have been and are stockholders, directors and executive officers of various other affiliates of SGRP. SBS, SAS and Infotech have been engaged or have threatened to engage in legal proceedings against the Company, which may result in future judgments adverse to the Company. The Company does not believe there is any reasonable basis for any new such claims and would defend them vigorously. See Legal Proceedings, below and Dependence Upon and Risks of Services Provided by Third Party Independent Contractors and Related Litigation and Risks Related to the Company's Significant Stockholders and Potential Voting Control and Conflicts, in these Risk Factors above and below, and Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- Legal Matters, below.\nThe Company executes and administers its domestic field services through the services of field merchandising, auditing, assembly and other field personnel (each a \"Field Specialist\"), substantially all of whom are provided to the Company and engaged by independent third parties and located, scheduled, deployed and administered domestically through the services of local, regional, district and other personnel (each a \"Field Administrator\"), and substantially all of the Field Administrators are in turn are employed by other independent third parties.\nPrior to August 2018, substantially all of the Company's domestic Field Specialist services were supplied SBS and to the Company's knowledge all of them were engaged as independent contractors by SBS. During this seven month period, SBS provided the services of approximately 3,800 Field Specialists (all of whom were engaged as independent contractors by SBS), representing 27% (or $15.4 million) of the total cost of the Field Specialist services utilized in 2018 by the Company domestically. SBS during 2017 provided the services of approximately 10,700 Field Specialists (all of whom were engaged as independent contractors by SBS), representing 77% (or $25.9 million) of the total cost of the Field Specialist services utilized by the Company domestically.\nThe Field Specialists are located, scheduled, deployed and administered domestically by local, regional, district and other personnel (each a \"Field Administrator\"), substantially all of whom since August 2018 were provided to the Company and engaged by another new independent vendor under contract and license with the Company. Prior to August 2018, substantially all of the Company's domestic Field Administrators were supplied by SPAR Administrative Services, Inc. (\"SAS\"). During this seven month period, SAS provided the services of approximately 52 Field Administrators (all of whom were employed by SAS) representing 53% (or $2.7 million) of the total cost of the Field Administrators utilized in 2018 by the Company domestically. SAS during 2017 provided the services of approximately 57 Field Administrators (all of whom were employed by SAS) representing 91% (or $4.2 million) of the total cost of the Field Administrators utilized by the Company domestically.\nAlthough neither SBS nor SAS has provided any services to the Company after their service terminations were effective on or shortly before July 31, 2018. SBS and SAS have apparently continued to operate and claim that the Company owes them for all of their post-termination expenses in perpetuity. See Note 10 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions - Domestic Related Party Services, below. See also Note 6 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- SBS Bankruptcy, below.\nThrough December 31, 2018, SBS has invoiced the Company for approximately $120,000, and SAS has invoiced the Company for approximately $76,000. All such invoices have been rejected by the Company. The Company has determined that it is not obligated to reimburse any such post-termination expense (other than for potentially reimbursing SAS for mutually approved reasonable short term ordinary course transition expenses in previously allowed categories needed by SAS to wind down its business, if any), and that such a payment would be an impermissible gift to a related party under Company policy and applicable law, which determinations have been supported by SGRP's Audit Committee. The SBS invoices included legal expenses for its continuing defense in the Clothier Case even though SGRP on June 13, 2018, gave SBS notice that it would no longer reimburse any such expenses as a result of SGRP's separate settlement of the Clothier Case. See Note 10 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions - Domestic Related Party Services, and Note 6 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- Legal Matters, below.\nThe Company expects that SBS and SAS may use every available means to attempt to collect reimbursement from the Company for the foreseeable future for all of their post-termination expense, including repeated litigation. See Note 6 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- Legal Matters, below.\nAccordingly, Management recommended and the Audit Committee agreed that it would be in the best interest of all stockholders: (i) to submit SGRP and SMF claims against SBS in the SBS Chapter 11 Case in order to preserve their value (including as an offset against SBS' claims), particularly since those claims against SBS exceed amounts potentially owed to SBS; (ii) to not voluntarily pay any SBS obligations directly to targeted SBS creditors, as such payments would reduce that offset value (potentially dollar-for-dollar), subvert the bankruptcy process and potentially expose SGRP and SMF to direct future liability (for example, liability for a lawsuit if SGRP voluntarily pays for its defense); and (iii) to only make payments to or on behalf of SBS to the extent proven and required in the SBS Chapter 11 Case or other court with jurisdiction over the dispute. See Note 6 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- SBS Bankruptcy, below.\nInfotech is currently suing the Company in New York seeking reimbursement for approximately $190,000 respecting alleged lost tax benefits and other expenses it claims to have incurred in connection with SGRP's acquisition of its Brazilian subsidiary and previously denied by both management and SGRP's Audit Committee, who had jurisdiction because Infotech is a related party. Infotech also is threatening to sue the Company in Romania for approximately $900,000 for programming services allegedly owed to the Company's former Romanian subsidiary (sold at book value to Infotech in 2013) and not provided to Infotech, which the Company vigorously denies. See Note 6 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- Infotech Litigation Against SGRP, below.\nPortions of the Company's proprietary scheduling, tracking, coordination, reporting and expense software (the \"Co-Owned Software\") are co-owned with SBS and Infotech and each has a license from the Company to use certain \"SPAR\" trademarks in the United States (the \"Licensed Marks\"). On November 23, 2018, SBS petitioned for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. District for Nevada (the \"SBS Chapter 11 Case\"), and as a result, SBS' rights in the Co-Owned Software and Licensed Marks are assets of SBS' estate, subject to sale or transfer in any court approved reorganization or liquidation. See Note 6 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- SBS Bankruptcy and Infotech Litigation Against SGRP, below. See also Dependence Upon and Risks of Services Provided by Independent Contractors and Related Litigation, Risks Related to the Company's Significant Stockholders and Potential Voting Control and Conflicts in these Risk Factors, below.\nTo a lesser extent, conflicts and events could arise with respect to the Company's contracts with joint venture affiliates. The Company periodically evaluates whether and the extent (if any) to which it continues to operate with such affiliates. See Note 10 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions - International Related Party Services, below.\nAdditionally, portions of the Company's proprietary scheduling, tracking, coordination, reporting and expense software (the \"Co-Owned Software\") currently included in the Company's Global Technology Systems are co-owned by the Company and SBS and Infotech, which may result in conflicts arising in the future. See \"An Overview of the Merchandising and Marketing Services Industry\" and \"The Company's Competition\", above, and Note 10 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions - Other Related Party Transactions and Arrangements, below. Certain of the Company's \"SPAR\" trademarks (the \"Licensed Marks\") are also licensed for use (i) in the United States royalty free and in perpetuity pursuant to license agreements that commenced in 1999 with its affiliates, SBS and Infotech (as defined in Related Parties And Related Party Litigation, in Item 3, below), (ii) worldwide royalty free and in perpetuity pursuant to informal license arrangements with its wholly owned subsidiaries, (iii) in their respective jurisdictions royalty free pursuant to license agreements for limited terms with its foreign joint venture subsidiaries, and (iv) in the United States for limited terms and modest royalties pursuant to license agreements with the Independent Field Vendor and Independent Field Administrator respectively providing Field Specialists and Field Administrators to the Company domestically that commenced in 2018. Except for SBS and Infotech (who don't need such software licenses because of their co-ownership), each subsidiary and vendor trademark license and arrangement also licenses the Co-Owned Software to the licensee.\nThe Company has contracts with certain international affiliates, including certain service providers to the Company's foreign joint venture subsidiaries. Any disagreement or other dispute in the business relationships arising in connection with such contracts may create a conflict of interest and cause such affiliates to act outside of the best interests of the Company. See Note 10 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions - International Related Party Services, below.\nAny litigation with any affiliate, any diminution in the value, availability or usefulness of the Co-Owned Software or Licensed Marks, or any cancellation, other nonperformance or material pricing increase under the Company's arrangements with any vendor, could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nRisks Related to the Company's Significant Stockholders and Potential Voting Control and Conflicts\nThe Company's co-founders, Mr. Robert G. Brown and Mr. William H. Bartels, are significant stockholders of SGRP. Mr. Brown was Chairman and an officer and director of SGRP through May 3, 3018 (when he retired), and Mr. Bartels was and continues to be Vice Chairman and a director and officer of SGRP. Mr. Brown beneficially owns approximately 32.1% (or approximately 6.7 million shares) of the SGRP Common Stock); and Mr. Bartels beneficially owns approximately 25.5% (or approximately 5.3 million shares) of the SGRP Common Stock; which amounts were calculated using their respective individual beneficial ownership and the total outstanding ownership (approximately 20.8 million shares) of the SGRP Common Stock on a non-diluted basis at December 31, 2018. This means that together Mr. Brown and Mr. Bartels (the \"Majority Stockholders\") beneficially own as a group a total of approximately 57.6% (or 12.0 million shares) of the SGRP Common Stock. If Messrs. Brown and Bartels act together again as group they have, and under certain circumstances if Mr. Brown acts alone he has, the ability to control (or significantly influence in the case of Mr. Brown acting alone) the election or removal of directors, the approval or disapproval of acquisitions, mergers, employee benefit plans, amendments to the Company's charter and/or bylaws, changes in Board size and all other matters that must or could be approved by the Company's stockholders.\nOn June 1, 2018, the Majority Stockholders each filed an amended Schedule 13D with the SEC, in which they each acknowledged that they \"may be deemed to comprise a 'group' within the meaning of [the Securities Exchange Act of 1934]\" and \"may act in concert with respect to certain matters,\" including (without limitation) to remove and appoint directors by written consent. On June 29, 2018, and July 5, 2018, SGRP received Written Consents from the Majority Stockholders endeavoring to unilaterally approve the selection, appointment and election of Mr. Jeffrey Mayer as a director of SGRP and remove Lorrence Kellar as an independent director, which was contested and ultimately concluded in a negotiated settlement. See Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- Legal Matters - Settled Delaware Litigations, below.\nOn August 6, 2018, the Majority Stockholders each filed another amended Schedule 13D with the SEC, in which they each acknowledged that they \"may be deemed to comprise a 'group' within the meaning of [the Securities Exchange Act of 1934]\" and \"may act in concert with respect to certain matters,\" including (without limitation) to adopt through a written consent proposed amendments to SGRP's By-Laws. On August 6, 2018, and September 18, 2018, SGRP received Written Consents from the Majority Stockholders endeavoring to unilaterally change SGRP's By-Laws in order to (among other things) weaken the independence of SGRP's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") through new supermajority requirements and stockholder only approvals and eliminate the Board's independent majority requirement, all in order to further benefit themselves, which was contested by SGRP and ultimately concluded in a negotiated settlement. See Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies-- Legal Matters -- Settled Delaware Litigations, below.\nOn January 25, 2019, the Majority Stockholders each filed another amended Schedule 13D with the SEC, in which they each acknowledged that they \"may be deemed to comprise a 'group' within the meaning of [the Securities Exchange Act of 1934]\" and \"may act in concert with respect to certain matters\", including various listed items.\nMr. Brown and Mr. Bartels continue to have significant influence and leverage over the Company's business, corporate governance and other significant actions, including those involving stockholder approvals. A \"super majority\" vote of at least 75% of all SGRP directors is now required under the Restated By-Laws for any committee assignment, SGRP stock issuance of more than 500,000 SGRP shares (other than pursuant to stockholder approved plans), or By-Laws changes, which can be blocked by any two directors representing the Majority Stockholders. The interests of the Majority Stockholders (such as changing Board composition and potentially weakening its independence, obtaining related party payments previously denied by the Company and Audit Committee and obtaining new retirement benefits for Mr. Brown previously denied by the Company and Compensation Committee) may be materially different from time to time from, and potentially in conflict with, the interests of other stockholders, and ownership concentration could cause, delay or prevent a change in the Company's control or otherwise discourage the Company's potential acquisition by another person, any of which could cause the market price of the SGRP Common Stock to decline and that decline could be significant.\nMr. Brown and Mr. Bartels continue to request material payments from the Company for various reasons, which they appear to believe involves several million dollars directly or indirectly owed to them, and which they have said they will litigate to obtain. The Company believes that there may be some justification for some small amount of payments to certain of their related parties (other than SBS) (see Potential Conflicts with Affiliates, above). As the Majority Stockholder group, Mr. Brown and Mr. Bartels also recently have stated their desire to increase SGRP's Board size to nine, and to add two new directors of their choosing, and SGRP's Governance Committee has been in discussion with them to evaluate the independence of the proposed nominees with a goal of maintain a majority of independent directors on the Board (as required by Nasdaq). Acting as a group, Mr. Brown and Mr. Bartels could remove all or any part of the current Board by voting \"no\" for targeted incumbents in the upcoming annual stockholders meeting or by executing more written consents. With fewer or no independent directors on the Board, Mr. Brown and Mr. Bartels could eventually be able to pay themselves without any effective restriction. In an effort to bring stability to the Company and Board for a reasonable period of time and avoid future costly litigation, the Company has been seeking and will continue to seek a settlement with Mr. Brown and Mr. Bartels that: (i) the Company can afford; (ii) is approved as a related party transaction by SGRP's Audit Committee as fair; appropriate and beneficial to the Company and all of its stockholders; (iii) is acceptable to the Company's domestic lender; (iv) releases the Company from current and future claims and litigation involving Mr. Brown, Mr. Bartels and their affiliates; and (v) stabilizes the Board and Company for a reasonable number of years.\nThere can be no assurance that the Majority Stockholders will refrain from together taking any further unilateral action through their written consents or otherwise. If such actions by the Majority Stockholders continue in the future, the Company must continue do devote significant management time and legal and financial resources, which would otherwise be spent on the Company's day-to-day business operations, to respond to and attempt to resolve the frequent claims, responses and actions by the Majority Stockholders (individually and on behalf of SBS, SAS and Infotech), which have been increasing in frequency and intensity. If the Majority Stockholders continue to together take such unilateral actions without restriction (see Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- Legal Matters - Delaware Litigations Settlement, below), it could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nRisks of Common Stock Ownership\nDividends on SGRP Common Stock are discretionary, have never been paid, are subject to restrictions in the Company's credit facilities and applicable law and can only be paid to the holders of SGRP Common Stock if the accrued and unpaid dividends and potential dividends are first paid to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. In the event of the Company's liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up, the holders of Common Stock are only entitled to share in the Company's assets, if any, that remain after the Company makes payment of and provision for all of the Company's debts and liabilities and the liquidation preferences of all of the Company's outstanding Preferred Stock. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will remain in any such case for dividends or distributions to the holders of SGRP Common Stock. A \"super majority\" vote of at least 75% of all SGRP directors is now required for any SGRP stock issuances of more than 500,000 shares (other than pursuant to stockholder approved plans), which issuance can be blocked by any two directors representing the Majority Stockholders.\nRisks related to the Company's Preferred Stock\nThe Company's ability to issue or redeem Preferred Stock, or any rights to purchase such shares, could discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For example, the Company could impede a business combination by issuing a series of preferred stock containing class voting rights that would enable the holders of such preferred stock to block a business combination transaction. Alternatively, the Company could facilitate a business combination transaction by issuing a series of preferred stock having sufficient voting rights to provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders. Additionally, under certain circumstances, the Company's issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the SGRP Common Stock. SGRP's Board could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of SGRP's stockholders may believe to be in their best interests or in which SGRP's stockholders may receive a premium for their stock over prevailing market prices of such stock. A \"super majority\" vote of at least 75% of all SGRP directors is now required for any SGRP preferred stock issuance, which issuance can be blocked by any two directors representing the Majority Stockholders.\nRisks of Illiquidity in SGRP Common Stock\nThe market price of SGRP Common Stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the sale price of SGRP Common Stock fluctuated from $0.45 to $3.75 per share. The Company believes that its Common Stock is subject to wide price fluctuations due to (among other things) the following:\n\u25cf\nThe relatively small public float and corresponding thin trading market for SGRP Common Stock, attributable to (among other things) the large block of voting shares beneficially owned by the Company's co-founders (as noted below) and generally low trading volumes, and that thin trading market may cause small trades to have significant impacts on SGRP Common Stock price.\n\u25cf\nThe substantial beneficial ownership of the Company's voting stock and potential control by Mr. Robert G. Brown and Mr. William H. Bartels, who are the Company's co-founders. Mr. Bartels is a director and Officer of the Company. Mr. Brown beneficially owns approximately 32.1% (or 6.7 million shares) of the SGRP Common Stock, and Mr. Bartels beneficially owns approximately 25.5% (or 5.3 million shares) of the SGRP Common Stock, which amounts were calculated using their individual beneficial ownerships and the total outstanding ownership (20.8 million shares) of the SGRP Common Stock on a non-diluted basis at December 31, 2018. This means that together they and their group beneficially own a total of approximately 57.5% (or 12.0 million shares) of the SGRP Common Stock (see Risks Related to the Company's Significant Stockholders: Potential Voting Control and Conflicts, below).\n\u25cf\nThe periodic potential risk of the delisting of SGRP Common Stock from trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") (as described below).\n\u25cf\nAny announcement, estimate or disclosure by the Company, or any projection or other claim or pronouncement by any of the Company's competitors or any financial analyst, commentator, blogger or other person, respecting (i) any new service created or improved, significant contract, business acquisition or relationship, or other publicized development by the Company or any of its competitors, or (ii) any change, fluctuation or other development in the Company's actual, estimated or desired affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition or in those of any of the Company's competitors, in each case irrespective of accuracy or validity and whether or not adverse or material.\n\u25cf\nThe general volatility of stock markets, consumer and investor confidence, and the general state of the economy (which often affect the prices of stock issued by the Company and many others without regard to financial results or condition).\nIf the Company issues (other than at fair market value for cash) or the Majority Stockholders sell a large number of shares of SGRP Common Stock, or if the market perceives such an issuance or sale is likely or imminent, the market price of SGRP Common Stock could decline and that decline could be significant.\nThe Company also has repurchased SGRP Common Stock from time to time, and currently has in place a Repurchase Program (as defined and described in Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, below). Those repurchases could adversely affect the market liquidity of the SGRP Common Stock.\nIn addition, the volatility in the market price of SGRP Common Stock could lead to class action securities litigation that could in turn impose substantial costs on the Company, divert management's attention and resources from the day-to-day operations of the Company's business and harm the Company's stock price, the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nRisks of Dilution\nThe Company may issue stock options and award restricted stock to directors, officers, employees and consultants in the future at Common Stock per-share exercise prices below the market price(s). In addition, the Company may issue shares of SGRP Common Stock in the future in furtherance of the Company's acquisitions or development of businesses or assets or litigation settlements. Each of those and other issuances of SGRP Common Stock could have a dilutive effect on the value of currently held shares, depending on the price the Company is paid (or the value of the assets or business acquired) for such shares, market conditions at the time and other factors. A \"super majority\" vote of at least 75% of all SGRP directors is now required for any SGRP stock issuance of more than 500,000 shares (other than pursuant to stockholder approved plans), which issuance can be blocked by any two directors representing the Majority Stockholders.\nRisks of a Nasdaq Delisting and Penny Stock Trading\nSGRP received a notification letter from Nasdaq, dated December 13, 2018 (the \"Nasdaq Board Independence Deficiency Letter\"), stating that SGRP no longer complied with Nasdaq's majority independent director requirement, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(b)(1) as a result of the Status Quo Order adding Mr. Jeffrey Mayer to SGRP's Board. See Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- Legal Matters - Delaware Litigation Settlement, below). See Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(b)(1) requires a majority of the board of directors of a listed company to be comprised of independent directors, as defined in Rule 5605(b)(1) (the \"Board Independence Rule\").\nOn January 31, 2019, SGRP submitted its plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance with the Board Independence Rule (the \"Compliance Plan\").\nIn the Compliance Plan, SGRP explained that it had more fully vetted and re-evaluated the independence of Mr. Mayer, based on (among other things) Mr. Mayer's independent business skills, his contribution to the Settlement (as defined in the Compliance Plan) process, his interactions with the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the \"Board\") over the last five months, and his lack of financial dealings with the Majority Stockholders (as defined in the Compliance Plan), and determined that he has the requisite independence from the management of the Corporation (to be considered an independent director under Rule 5605 (a)(2)) for the purposes of serving on the Board and its Compensation Committee. He will, however, be considered an interested director and excluded from any decision respecting any related party matter (as defined in the Compliance Plan), which are within the Audit Committee's purview, and he is not being appointed to the Audit Committee or the Governance Committee.\nOn February 5, 2019, Nasdaq sent SGRP a letter (the \"Compliance Letter\"), stating that Nasdaq \"Staff has determined that since the Company's Board of Directors currently consists of four independent and three non-independent directors, it complies with the Rule and this matter is now closed.\"\nSGRP received a notification letter from Nasdaq dated December 10, 2018 (the \"Nasdaq Bid Price Deficiency Letter\"), stating that SGRP had failed to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share for shares of the SGRP Common Stock for the prior 30 consecutive business days preceding the Nasdaq Bid Price Deficiency Letter (i.e., October 25, 2018 - December 7, 2018) as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \"Bid Price Rule\"). The Nasdaq Bid Price Deficiency Letter provides that SGRP has until June 10, 2019, as a grace period to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by maintaining a closing bid price of $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. If at any time during the grace period the bid price of SGRP's Common Stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide SGRP with written confirmation of compliance.\nSGRP has not yet regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule, and its failure to do so could lead to the delisting of SGRP's securities.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to comply in the future with Nasdaq's Board Independence Rule or Bid Price Rule or other Nasdaq continued listing requirements. If the Company fails to satisfy the applicable continued listing requirement and continues to be in non-compliance with the Bid Price Rule and the applicable six-month grace period ends, Nasdaq may commence delisting procedures against the Company (during which the Company may have additional time of up to six months to appeal and correct its non-compliance). If the SGRP Common Stock shares were ultimately delisted by Nasdaq, trading of the SGRP Common Stock could be limited to \"over-the-counter\" trades and the market liquidity of the SGRP Common Stock could be adversely affected, which could result in a decrease in the market price of the SGRP Common Stock due to (among other things) the potential for increased spreads between bids and asks, lower trading volumes and reporting delays in over-the-counter trades and the negative implications and perceptions that could arise from such a delisting.\nIn addition to the foregoing, if the SGRP Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is traded on the over-the-counter market, the application of the \"penny stock\" rules could adversely affect the market price of the SGRP Common Stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \"penny stock\" as any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on Nasdaq that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. If the SGRP Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is traded on the over-the-counter market at a price of less than $5.00 per share, the SGRP Common Stock would be considered a penny stock. Unless otherwise exempted, the SEC's penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stock and the risks in the penny stock market, the current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. Further, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, the penny stock rules require the broker-dealer to provide a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's agreement to the transaction. If applicable in the future, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of brokers-dealers to sell the SGRP Common Stock and may adversely affect the ability of investors to sell their shares.\nRisk of Failure to Maintain Effective Internal Controls\nEstablishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosures are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial and other reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted and applicable securities and other law in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial and other reporting are not intended to provide absolute assurance that the Company could prevent or detect a misstatement of its financial statements or other reports or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial and disclosure reporting could limit the Company's ability to report its financial results and file its other reports accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial or disclosure reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial or other reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and a decline in the market price of the SGRP Common Stock. See also Risks of Having Material Local Investors and Local Executives in International and Domestic Subsidiaries, below.\nRisks of Having Material Local Investors and Local Executives in International and Domestic Subsidiaries\nThe Company's international model is to join forces with Local Investors (as defined below) having merchandising service expertise and combine their knowledge of the local market with the Company's proprietary software and expertise in the merchandising business. The Company also has begun to use this model in the United States (see Item 1 - Business - The Company's Domestic and International Segments, above). As a result, each of the Company's international subsidiaries (other than Canada and Japan) and NMS domestically is owned in material part by an entity in the local country where the international or domestic subsidiary resides and that entity is not otherwise affiliated with the Company (e.g., the \"Local Investor\"). The agreements between the Company and the Local Investor in the respective international or domestic subsidiaries specify, among other things, the equity, programming and support services the Company is required to provide and the equity, credit support, certain services and management support that the Local Investor is required to provide to the international or domestic subsidiary. Certain of those subsidiaries also may be procuring field merchandising execution through affiliates of the applicable Local Investors. The Local Investor or its principal generally is the Chief Executive Officer of the international or domestic subsidiary for an open-ended term and has considerable autonomy and authority over its operations. The Local Investors also may wish to conduct the subsidiary's business differently than desired by the Company. In the event of any disagreement or other dispute in the business relationships between the Company and Local Investor, the Local Investor may have one or more conflicts of interest with respect to the relationship and could cause the applicable international or domestic subsidiary to operate or otherwise act in a way that is not consistent with the Company's instructions or best interests.\nThe agreements generally have unlimited contract terms and parties generally do not have the right to unilaterally withdraw. However, a non-defaulting party has the right to terminate such agreement upon the other party's default, receipt of notice and failure to cure within a specified period (generally 60 days internationally or 30 days domestically). In addition, either party, at any time after the end of a specified period (usually between three and five years), may: (1) sell all or part of its equity interest in the international subsidiary to a third party by providing a written notice to the other party of such intentions (in which case the other party has the right of first refusal and may purchase the equity of the offering party under the same terms and conditions) (a \"Right of First Refusal\"); or (2) offer to purchase the equity of the other party (in which case the other party generally has 120 days to either accept or reject the offer or to reverse the transaction and actually purchase the offering party's equity under the same terms and conditions) (a \"Buy/Sell Right\").\nThe Company believes its relationships with the Local Investors in its international subsidiaries remain good. Most of the Company's respective international subsidiary contracts are either at or near the end of the applicable periods during which either of the parties may trigger the Right of First Refusal and Buy/Sell provisions described above. Both the Company and such Local Investors, as part of their ongoing relationship, are or will be assessing appropriate action as described above.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company could (if necessary under the circumstances) successfully (i) enforce its legal remedies and stop a Local Investor's principals from leaving the local subsidiary and establishing a competing business, (ii) replace equity, credit support, management, field merchandiser and other services currently provided by any Local Investor in sufficient time to perform its client obligations or (iii) provide these services and or equity in the event the Local Stockholder were to sell its stock or reduce any support to the Company's subsidiary in the applicable country. Any cancellation, other nonperformance or material change under the subsidiary agreements with Local Investors could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nRisks Associated with International and Domestic Subsidiaries\nWhile the Company endeavors to limit its exposure for claims and losses in any international or domestic consolidated subsidiary through contractual provisions, insurance and use of single purpose entities for such ventures, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be held liable for the claims against and losses of a particular international or domestic consolidated subsidiary under applicable local law or local interpretation of any subsidiary agreements or insurance provisions. If any such claims and losses should occur, be material in amount and be successfully asserted against the Company, such claims and losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nRisks Associated with Foreign Currency\nThe Company also has foreign currency risk exposure associated with its international subsidiaries. In 2018, these foreign currency exposures were primarily concentrated in the Mexican Peso, South African Rand, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, and Brazilian Real.\nRisks Associated with International Business\nThe Company's expansion strategy includes expansion into various countries around the world. There can be no assurances that the respective business environments will remain favorable. In the future, the Company's international operations and sales may be affected by the following risks, which may adversely affect United States companies doing business in foreign countries:\n\u2022\nPolitical and economic risks, including terrorist attacks and political instability;\n\u2022\nVarious forms of protectionist trade legislation that currently exist or have been proposed;\n\u2022\nExpenses associated with customizing services and technology;\n\u2022\nLocal laws and business practices that favor local competition;\n\u2022\nDependence on local vendors and potential for undisclosed related party transactions;\n\u2022\nMultiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws, regulations and enforcement;\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax and employment law consequences;\n\u2022\nLocal accounting principles, practices and procedures;\n\u2022\nLocal legal principles, practices and procedures, local contract review and negotiation, and limited familiarity with contract issues (excessive warranties, extra-territoriality, sweeping intellectual property claims and the like);\n\u2022\nLimited familiarity or an unwillingness to comply with, or wrongly believing the inapplicability of, generally accepted accounting principles in the USA (\"GAAP\"), applicable corporate controls and policies of the Company (including its Ethics Code), or applicable law in the USA (including Nasdaq rules, securities laws, anti-terrorism law, Sarbanes Oxley and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act);\n\u2022\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations and limits on the export of funds;\n\u2022\nSubstantial communication barriers, including those arising from language, culture, custom and time zones; and\n\u2022\nSupervisory challenges arising from agreements, distance, physical absences and such communication barriers.\nIf any developments should occur with respect to any of those international risks and materially and adversely affect the Company's applicable international subsidiary, such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.", "PERMNO": 83303, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "SGRP"}
