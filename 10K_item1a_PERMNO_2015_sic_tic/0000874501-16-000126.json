Risk Factors\nReferences in the risk factors to \u201cAmbac\u201d are to Ambac Financial Group, Inc. References to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cCompany\u201d are to Ambac and its subsidiaries, as the context requires. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this section shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K or in Note 1. Background and Business Description to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K unless otherwise indicated.\nRisks Related to AMBC Common Shares\nThe price per share of Ambac's common stock may be subject to a high degree of volatility, including significant price declines.\nAmbac's common stock, which was issued pursuant to its Reorganization Plan, began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market on May 1, 2013. Although Ambac's common stock is listed on NASDAQ, there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of the trading market or the price at which such shares can be sold. The price of the shares may decline substantially in response to a number of events or circumstances, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nchanges in investors\u2019 or analysts\u2019 valuation measures for our stock;\n\u2022\nmarket trends unrelated to our stock;\n\u2022\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our business strategy;\n\u2022\nresults and actions of other participants in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in the perceived risk within our insured portfolio; and\n\u2022\nadverse developments in our financial condition or results of operation.\nIn addition, the price of Ambac's shares will be affected by the additional risks described below, including risks associated with Ambac Assurance\u2019s ability to deliver value to Ambac.\nAmbac may not be able to realize value from Ambac Assurance.\nBecause Ambac is a holding company, the value of its stock is dependent upon the residual value of its main operating subsidiary,\nAmbac Assurance, the receipt of payments to be made by Ambac Assurance pursuant to the Amended TSA and the Cost Allocation Agreement, the receipt of payments on the Owner Trust Certificate issued to Ambac by Corolla Trust (the \"Owner Trust Certificate\"), and the receipt of dividends from Ambac Assurance. There can be no assurance that Ambac will be able to realize residual value in Ambac Assurance, which is in run-off. In addition, the Segregated Account of Ambac Assurance Corporation is subject to rehabilitation proceedings and under the control of the Rehabilitator, as further described below. It is unclear whether Ambac Assurance and the Segregated Account will be able to satisfy all of their respective obligations to policyholders, holders of their respective surplus notes and holders of Ambac Assurance\u2019s preferred stock, even if Ambac Assurance and the Segregated Account are successful in achieving recoveries and mitigating losses. Our ability to achieve recoveries and mitigate losses is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including perceptions of the value of Ambac\u2019s guarantees and securities.\nDue to the above considerations, as well as applicable legal and contractual restrictions described elsewhere herein, it is highly unlikely that Ambac Assurance will be able to pay Ambac any dividends for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the payments to be made to Ambac under the Amended TSA and the Cost Allocation Agreement are subject to contingencies that are difficult to predict, making the amount and timing, if any, of such payments uncertain. Payments to be made under the Amended TSA, in particular, depend on the generation of taxable income by Ambac Assurance above certain thresholds. Ambac Assurance\u2019s ability to generate taxable income above such thresholds is uncertain. Due to these factors, there can be no assurance as to the amounts that Ambac will receive from Ambac Assurance under the Amended TSA.\nIt is also uncertain whether and to what extent Ambac will realize value from the Owner Trust Certificate. The Owner Trust Certificate is subordinated to $299.2 million of senior secured notes issued by Corolla Trust. Such notes and the Owner Trust Certificate are collateralized by and payable solely from a $350.0 million face amount Segregated Account junior surplus note plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. No payment of interest on or principal of a Segregated Account junior surplus note may be made until all existing and future indebtedness of the Segregated Account, including Segregated Account surplus notes, policy claims and claims having statutory priority, and all existing and future senior ranking surplus notes, contribution notes or similar obligations of Ambac Assurance, have been paid in full. All payments of principal and interest on Segregated Account junior surplus notes are subject to the prior approval of the OCI. If the OCI does not approve the payment of interest on Segregated Account junior surplus notes, such interest will accrue and compound annually until paid. Payments on the senior secured notes issued by Corolla Trust will be only made when and to the extent that the Segregated Account makes payments on the junior surplus note held by Corolla Trust. The senior secured notes must be paid in full before any payments will be made on the Owner Trust Certificate. If Corolla Trust has failed to pay all interest and principal outstanding on the senior\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 19 2015 FORM 10-K |\nsecured notes within three business days of August 28, 2039, the senior secured noteholders may also take possession of and sell the junior surplus note. If such a sale were to occur, it is uncertain whether and to what extent there would be any value for the Owner Trust Certificate after satisfaction of the senior secured notes.\nThe value of Ambac's common stock may also depend upon the ability of Ambac to generate earnings apart from Ambac Assurance. As noted below, Ambac is exploring new business opportunities, but there are no assurances regarding its ability to enter new businesses or the prospects of any such new businesses.\nThe issuance of new common stock may dilute current shareholder value or have adverse effects on the market price of Ambac's common stock.\nIf Ambac raises capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock, whether for a new business, general corporate purposes, or in exchange for other securities, the value of current shareholders\u2019 interests may be diluted as Ambac is not required to offer any such shares to existing stockholders on a preemptive basis.\nAmbac cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of its common stock, or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of its common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for its common stock.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities that rank senior to Ambac's common stock may adversely affect the market price of its common stock.\nIf Ambac decides to issue debt or additional equity securities in the future that rank senior to its common stock, it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting its operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities issued in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of common stock and may result in dilution to owners of common stock. Because Ambac's decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control, it cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of future offerings. Holders of common stock bear the risk of future offerings reducing the market price of Ambac's common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in the Company.\nThe occurrence of certain events could result in the initiation of rehabilitation proceedings against Ambac Assurance, with resulting adverse consequences to holders of Ambac securities.\nIncreased loss development in the General Account of Ambac Assurance or significant losses resulting from litigation against Ambac Assurance may prompt OCI to determine that it is in the best interests of policyholders to initiate rehabilitation proceedings with respect to Ambac Assurance, either preemptively or in response to any such event.\nIf, as a result of the occurrence of any such event(s), OCI decides to initiate rehabilitation proceedings with respect to Ambac Assurance, adverse consequences may result, including, without limitation, the assertion of damages by counterparties (including mark-to-market claims with respect to insured transactions executed in ISDA format) and the acceleration of losses based on early\ntermination triggers and the loss of control rights in insured transactions, thereby reducing the residual value of Ambac Assurance. Additionally, the Rehabilitator would assume control of all of Ambac Assurance\u2019s assets and management of Ambac Assurance. In exercising control, the Rehabilitator will act for the benefit of policyholders, and will not take into account the interests of securityholders of Ambac. Such actions may result in material adverse consequences for Ambac\u2019s securityholders.\nRisks Related to Insured Portfolio Losses\nSome issuers of public finance obligations we insure are experiencing fiscal stress that could result in increased losses on those obligations or increased liquidity claims, including losses or claims resulting from payment defaults, Chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings or loss of market access.\nWe have historically experienced low levels of defaults in our public finance insured portfolio, including during the financial crisis that began in mid-2007. However, some issuers of public finance obligations we insure have reported budget shortfalls, significantly underfunded pensions or other fiscal stresses that will require them to significantly raise taxes and/or cut spending in order to satisfy their obligations. Government entities may also take other actions that may impact their own creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of related issuers. Some issuers of obligations we insure have either defaulted or filed for bankruptcy, raising concerns about their ultimate ability to service the debt we insure and our ability to recover claims paid in the future. If the issuers of the obligations in our public finance portfolio are unable to raise taxes, cut spending, or receive federal assistance, or if such issuers default or file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9, we may experience liquidity claims and/or ultimate losses on those obligations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe insure obligations of several issuers that have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 9. The consequences of such proceedings for creditors remain uncertain. For example, the treatment of General Obligation debt in relation to other obligations remains in flux, with Detroit's recent precedent unfavorable for debt creditors. If issuers succeed in materially adjusting their obligations to bondholders and financial guarantors, other issuers may be encouraged to default or file for Chapter 9 protection and seek similar adjustments to their debt. These events could materially increase losses in Ambac\u2019s insured portfolio of municipal credits.\nLoss of market access is a risk embedded in our municipal exposures. From time to time the municipal bond market evidences heightened investor concerns overall or for select sectors or issuers, as has recently been the case with Puerto Rico. Such adverse market conditions may trigger a loss of market liquidity for affected issuers, which in turn may significantly raise their cost of alternative financing or cause a liquidity crisis and potential for default on debt service payments we guarantee.\nWe have significant exposure to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, including its affiliates and public corporations. The Commonwealth has announced that it cannot meet its obligations and that it intends to impair some or all of its creditors. The Commonwealth has proposed to restructure its obligations and those of certain of its affiliates and public corporations through a voluntary exchange offer. Although Ambac believes this plan is unlikely to proceed in its current form, it is possible that other alternatives could be proposed or adopted that could significantly impair our exposures,\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 20 2015 FORM 10-K |\nincluding by failing to recognize or properly differentiate legal structures and protections applicable to such exposures, such that our loss reserves would need to be increased. While our reserving scenarios reflect a wide range of possible outcomes reflecting the significant uncertainty regarding future developments and outcomes, there could be material variability in our loss reserves for the foreseeable future.\nLoss reserves may not be adequate to cover potential losses; changes in loss reserves may result in further volatility of net income and comprehensive earnings.\nLoss reserves are established when management has observed credit deterioration, in most cases, when the underlying credit is considered below investment grade. Loss reserves established with respect to our non-derivative financial guarantee insurance policies are based upon estimates and judgments by management, including estimates and judgments with respect to the probability of default, the severity of loss upon default, management\u2019s ability to execute policy commutations, and estimated remediation recoveries for, among other things, breaches by RMBS issuers of representations and warranties. Furthermore, the objective of establishing loss reserve estimates is not to reflect the worst possible outcome. While our reserving scenarios reflect a wide range of possible outcomes reflecting the significant uncertainty regarding future developments and outcomes, our loss reserves may change materially based on future developments. As a result of the inherent uncertainties in the estimates and judgments made to determine loss reserves, there can be no assurance that either the actual losses in our financial guarantee insurance portfolio will not exceed such reserves or that our reserves will not increase or decrease materially over time as circumstances, our assumptions, or our models change.\nAdditionally, inherent in our estimates of loss severities and remediation recoveries is the assumption that we will retain control rights in respect of our insured portfolio. However, according to the terms of relevant transaction documents, we are subject to the loss of control rights in many insured transactions in the event that we are the subject of delinquency proceedings and/or other regulatory actions which could result from our deteriorated financial position. In the event that we lose control rights, our ability to mitigate loss severities and realize remediation recoveries will be compromised, and actual ultimate losses in our insured portfolio could exceed our loss reserves. The Rehabilitation Court issued an injunction against certain actions by holders of policies in the Segregated Account and other counterparties, including actions resulting in, or based on, the loss of control rights. If this injunction does not successfully preclude such actions, Ambac Assurance could lose its control rights with respect to policies in the Segregated Account.\nWe also rely on internally and externally developed complex financial models, including default models related to RMBS and waterfall modeling provided by a nationally recognized vendor for RMBS and student loan exposures, to project performance of our insured obligations. Differences in the models that we employ, and/or flaws in these financial models and/or faulty assumptions inherent in these financial models and those determined by management, could lead to material changes in projected outcomes, and could include increased losses and loss reserves. Uncertainty with respect to the ultimate performance of certain of our insured exposures may result in substantial changes in loss reserves and/or actual losses. Moreover, modeled estimates of transaction performance depend in part on our interpretations of contracts and other bases of our legal\nrights. Such interpretations may prove to be incorrect or different interpretations may be employed by bond trustees and other transaction participants, which could lead to increased losses and loss reserves.\nOur credit risk management policies and practices may not adequately identify significant risks.\nAs described in Part I, Item 1, \u201cRisk Management\u201d in this Form 10-K, we have established risk management policies and practices which seek to mitigate our exposure to credit risk in our insured portfolio. Ongoing surveillance of credit risks in our insured portfolio is an important component of our risk management. These policies and practices in the past have not insulated us from risks that were unforeseen and which had unanticipated loss severity, and such policies and practices may not do so in the future. There can be no assurance that these policies and practices will be adequate to avoid future losses. If we are not able to identify significant risks, we may not be able to and/or timely remediate such risks, thereby increasing the amount of losses to which we are exposed. An inability to identify significant risks could also result in the failure to establish loss reserves that are sufficient in relation to such risks.\nWe are subject to credit risk and other risks related to RMBS and securities backed by student loans.\nWe have insured RMBS transactions, as well as securities backed by student loans, and are thus exposed to risk associated with those asset classes. Performance of these transactions, as well as others, can be adversely affected by general economic conditions, such as recession, rising unemployment rates, underemployment, home prices that decline or do not increase in the patterns assumed in our models, increasing foreclosure rates and unavailability of consumer credit, mortgage product attributes, such as interest rate adjustments and balloon payment obligations, borrower and/or originator fraud, mortgage and student loan servicer performance, including underperformance and financial difficulty.\nWhile further deterioration in the performance of consumer assets, including mortgage-related assets and student loans, may occur, the timing, extent and duration of any future deterioration of the credit markets is unknown, as is the impact, if any, on potential claim payments and ultimate losses of the securities within Ambac Assurance\u2019s portfolio. In addition, there can be no assurance that any governmental or private sector initiatives designed to address such credit deterioration in the markets will be successful or inure to the benefit of the transactions we insure. For example, borrower protection for student loan debt in bankruptcy may adversely affect our portfolio. Similarly, servicer settlements with governmental authorities regarding foreclosure irregularities are generally designed to protect homeowners and may increase losses on securities we insure.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that we would be successful, or that we would not be delayed, in enforcing the subordination provisions, credit enhancements or other contractual provisions of the RMBS that Ambac Assurance insures in the event of litigation or the bankruptcy of other transaction parties.\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 21 2015 FORM 10-K |\nRisks Related to the Financial and Credit Markets\nChanges in prevailing interest rate levels and market conditions could adversely impact our business results and prospects.\nIncreases in prevailing interest rate levels can adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and, therefore, our financial strength. In the event that investments must be sold in order to pay claims, to pay Deferred Amounts, to redeem surplus notes, or to meet Financial Services liquidity needs due to contract terminations or collateral posting requirements, such investments would likely be sold at discounted prices. Additionally, increasing interest rates would have an adverse impact on our insured portfolio. For example, increasing interest rates could result in higher claim payments in respect of defaulted obligations that bear interest at floating rates of interest. Higher interest rates can also lead to increased credit stress on consumer asset-backed transactions in our insured portfolio (as the securitized assets supporting a portion of these exposures are floating rate consumer obligations), slower prepayment speeds and resulting \u201cextension risk\u201d relative to such consumer asset-backed transactions in our insured portfolio and in our investment portfolio and decreased refinancing activity.\nDecreasing interest rates could result in early terminations of financial guarantee insurance policies in respect of which we are paid on an installment basis and do not receive a termination premium, thus reducing premium earned in respect of these transactions. Decreases in prevailing interest rates may also limit growth of or reduce investment income and may adversely impact the result of our interest rate swap portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio may also be adversely affected by credit rating downgrades, ABS and RMBS prepayment speeds, foreign exchange movements, spread volatility, and credit losses.\nRevenues and cash flow would be adversely impacted due to a decline in realization of installment premiums.\nDue to the installment nature of a significant percentage of its premium income, Ambac Assurance has an embedded future revenue stream. The amount of installment premiums actually realized by Ambac Assurance could be reduced in the future due to factors such as early termination of insurance contracts, accelerated prepayments of underlying obligations or insufficiency of cash flows (by the premium paying entity). Additionally, the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings may result in the loss of installment premium income from such insured transactions if orders of the Rehabilitation Court are not effective. Such reductions would result in lower revenues.\nWe are subject to credit risk throughout our businesses, including large single risks, risk concentrations, correlated risks and reinsurance counterparty credit risk.\nWe are exposed to the risk that issuers of debt which we have insured (or with respect to which we have written credit derivatives), issuers of debt which we hold in our investment portfolio, reinsurers and other contract counterparties (including derivative counterparties) may default in their financial obligations, whether as the result of insolvency, lack of liquidity, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. These credit risks could cause increased losses and loss reserves, estimates of credit impairments and mark-to-market losses with respect to credit derivatives in our financial guarantee business; and we could experience losses and decreases in the value of our investment portfolio and, therefore, our financial strength. Such\ncredit risks may be in the form of large single risk exposures to particular issuers, reinsurers or counterparties; losses caused by catastrophic events (including terrorist acts and natural disasters); losses caused by increases in municipal defaults; or losses in respect of different, but correlated, credit exposures.\nRisks Related to Strategic Plan\nAmbac is exploring new business opportunities which may not be consummated, or if consummated, may not create value and may negatively impact our financial results.\nAmbac is exploring new business opportunities for the Company, which may involve the acquisition of assets or existing businesses or the development of businesses through new or existing subsidiaries. It is not possible at this time to predict the future prospects or other characteristics of any such new business. Efforts to pursue new business opportunities may be unsuccessful or require significant financial or other resources, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition. No assurance can be given that Ambac will be able to complete the acquisition or development of any business or, if acquired or developed, generate any earnings or be able to successfully integrate such business into our current operating structure.\nMoreover, Ambac\u2019s ability to enter new businesses, including new businesses apart from Ambac Assurance, is also subject to significant doubt, given the condition and circumstances of Ambac Assurance, the difficulty of leveraging or monetizing its other assets, and the uncertainty of its ability to raise capital. Due to these factors, as well as those relating to Ambac Assurance as described above, the value of our securities is highly speculative.\nRisk Related to Rehabilitation\nActions of the Rehabilitator could adversely affect Ambac, including impacting our ability to realize our remediation recoveries.\nAs a consequence of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings, the Rehabilitator retains operational control and decision-making authority with respect to all matters related to the Segregated Account, including surveillance, remediation, loss mitigation and efforts to recover losses in the Segregated Account, including recovery efforts in respect of breaches of representations and warranties by sponsors of Ambac-insured RMBS. Similarly, by virtue of the contracts executed between Ambac Assurance and the Segregated Account in connection with the establishment, and subsequent rehabilitation, of the Segregated Account, the Rehabilitator retains the discretion to oversee and approve certain actions taken by Ambac Assurance in respect of assets and liabilities that remain in Ambac Assurance. Moreover, the Rehabilitator retains the sole discretion to adjust claim payments, to make payments on Deferred Amounts and, with regulatory approval, to make payments on or redeem Segregated Account surplus notes (which would require Ambac Assurance to make proportionate payments on or proportionately redeem its surplus notes). As a result, certain efforts to remediate losses, and certain other actions taken by Ambac Assurance, are subject to the approval of the Rehabilitator, as are decisions about the timing of payments of significant liabilities of the Segregated Account. In exercising such authority, the Rehabilitator will act for the benefit of policyholders, and will not take into account the interests of securityholders of Ambac. Decisions made by the Rehabilitator for the benefit of policyholders may result in material adverse consequences for\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 22 2015 FORM 10-K |\nAmbac\u2019s securityholders. In addition, we are not able to predict the impact such decisions will have on the remediation of losses, and, in particular, on our efforts to recover losses attributable to breaches of representations and warranties by sponsors of Ambac-insured RMBS, our ability to commute outstanding policies and purchase insured bonds or surplus notes, or how vigorously the Rehabilitator will pursue risk remediation in general. We are similarly unable to predict the decisions of the Rehabilitator as to claims payments or payments on Deferred Amounts or, with regulatory approval, payments on or redemptions of Segregated Account surplus notes, the timing and impact of which may negatively affect our financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, any negative consequences resulting from payments on or redemptions of Segregated Account surplus notes would be magnified due to the fact that the Rehabilitator\u2019s decision to make such payments would require Ambac Assurance to make proportionate payments on its surplus notes.\nIntercompany disputes or disputes with OCI may arise, which may have material adverse effects on the Company.\nThe Segregated Account, Ambac Assurance, Ambac and other affiliates have entered into agreements that govern certain activities of such entities. OCI has certain enforcement rights with respect to such agreements and, as regulator of Ambac Assurance and as Rehabilitator of the Segregated Account, has further authority over the activities of Ambac Assurance and the Segregated Account. Disputes may arise over the interpretation of such agreements, the exercise or purported exercise of rights thereunder, or the performance of or failure or purported failure to perform obligations thereunder. Disputes may also arise over certain actions taken or proposed to be taken by OCI in reliance on its contractual or legal rights or in reaction to actions taken or to be taken by the Company. In taking such actions or reacting to actions or decisions of the Company, the Rehabilitator will act for the benefit of policyholders, and will not take into account the interests of securityholders of Ambac. Any such dispute could have material adverse effects on the Company, whether through litigation, failure to execute transactions sought by management, interference with corporate strategies, objectives or prerogatives, inefficient decision-making or execution, forced realignment of resources, increased costs, distractions to management, strained working relationships or otherwise. Such effects would also increase the risk that OCI would seek to initiate rehabilitation proceedings against Ambac Assurance.\nRisks Related to Capital, Liquidity and Markets\nOur inability to realize the expected recoveries included in our financial statements could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn January 2016, Ambac Assurance settled its RMBS-related disputes and litigation against JP Morgan Chase & Co. and certain of its affiliates (collectively \"JP Morgan\"). Pursuant to the settlement, JP Morgan paid Ambac Assurance $995,000 in cash. Excluding these amounts. as of December 31, 2015, we have estimated representation and warranty subrogation recoveries of $1,807.3 million (net of reinsurance) included in our financial statements. These recoveries are based on contractual claims arising from RMBS transactions that we have insured, and represent a probability-weighted estimate of amounts we expect to recover under various possible scenarios, and do not reflect the best or the worst possible outcomes with respect to any particular transaction or group of transactions. Our ability to recover these amounts is subject to significant uncertainty, including risks inherent in\nlitigation, collectability of such amounts from counterparties and/or their respective parents and affiliates, timing of receipt of any such recoveries, intervention by OCI or the Rehabilitator which could impede our ability to take the actions required to realize such recoveries, and uncertainties inherent in the assumptions used in estimating such recoveries. The amount of these subrogation recoveries is significant and if we were unable to recover amounts other than JP Morgan, our stockholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2015 would decrease from $1,958.3 million to $151.0 million.\nWe expect to recover material amounts of claims payments through remediation measures other than the litigation described above as well as through cash flows in the securitization structures of transactions that we insure. Realization of such expected recoveries is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the rights and defenses of other parties with interests that conflict with our interests, the performance of the collateral and assets backing the obligations that we insure, the performance of servicers involved in securitizations in which we participate as insurer, and the effect on our rights of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Plan and orders of the Rehabilitation Court. Additionally, the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings may result in the loss of future recoveries in insured transactions. Adverse developments with respect to such variables may cause our recoveries to fall below expectations.\nWe may not be able to successfully monetize assets or purchase, restructure or exchange outstanding debt and insurance obligations.\nAmbac Assurance is considering the possibility of entering into transactions whereby it would monetize certain assets and/or purchase, restructure or exchange its outstanding debt and insurance obligations. Transactions of this nature may not be feasible or economically viable. Moreover, Ambac Assurance may be unable to secure the approval of the Rehabilitator or OCI to consummate such a transaction. Even if such a transaction is consummated, it may ultimately prove to be unsuccessful in creating value.\nThe change in composition of the securities in our investment portfolio exposes us to greater risk.\nAmbac Assurance maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in lower-rated securities in order to increase the risk-adjusted return on its portfolio. Investments in lower-rated securities and \u201calternative assets\u201d could expose Ambac to increased losses and decreased liquidity in the investment portfolio.\nThe determination of the amount of other-than temporary impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.\nThe determination of the amount of impairments on our investments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in impairments as such evaluations are revised. There can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. We use\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 23 2015 FORM 10-K |\nexternally developed financial models to project impairments with respect to RMBS held in our investment portfolio, including Ambac Assurance guaranteed RMBS. Differences in the models we employ and/or flaws in these models and/or faulty assumptions inherent in these models and those determined by management, could lead to increased impairments with respect to RMBS in our investment portfolio.\nRisks Related to the Company's Business\nWe are subject to the risk of litigation and regulatory inquiries or investigations, and the outcome of proceedings we are or may become involved in could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial position, profitability or cash flows.\nAmbac Assurance is defending various lawsuits relating to its financial guarantee business. In addition, the Company from time to time receives various regulatory inquiries and requests for information. Please see Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for information on these various proceedings.\nIt is not possible to predict whether additional suits will be filed or whether additional inquiries or requests for information will be made, and it is also not possible to predict the outcome of litigation, inquiries or requests for information. It is possible that there could be unfavorable outcomes in these or other proceedings. Management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from unfavorable outcomes or of the expenses that will be incurred in defending these lawsuits. Under some circumstances, adverse results in any such proceedings and/or the incurring of significant litigation expenses could be material to our business, operations, financial position, profitability or cash flows.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches and cyber-attacks could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on our information technology systems for many enterprise-critical functions and a prolonged failure or interruption of these systems for any reason could cause significant disruption to our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our information technology and application systems may be vulnerable to threats from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions. Computer hackers may be able to penetrate our network\u2019s system security and misappropriate or compromise confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. In addition to our own confidential information, we sometimes receive and are required to protect confidential information from third parties. To the extent any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of our confidential information or that of others, it could cause significant financial losses that are either not or not fully insured against, damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with third parties, lead to claims against us, result in regulatory action, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to mitigate the damage caused by any security breach, or to protect against future damage. Moreover, although we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, we may not be able to adequately execute these plans in a timely fashion in the event of a disruption to our information technology and application systems.\nWe may incur losses resulting from operational risk due to inadequate or failed internal processes, breakdown of settlement or communication systems, inadequate execution of strategy or from external events leading to disruption of our business. Events subject to operational risk include:\n\u2022\nInternal Fraud-misappropriation of assets, intentional mismarking of positions\n\u2022\nExternal Fraud-theft of information, third-party theft and forgery\n\u2022\nClients, Products, & Business Practice-improper trade, fiduciary breaches\n\u2022\nDamage to Physical Assets-vandalism\n\u2022\nBusiness Disruption & System Failures-software failures, hardware failures; and\n\u2022\nExecution, Delivery, & Process Management-data entry errors, accounting errors, failed mandatory reporting, settlement errors, and negligence.\nWe may be adversely affected by failures in services or products provided by third parties.\nWe have outsourced and may continue to outsource certain segments of our operations and business, and rely upon third-party vendors for other essential services and information, such as the provision of data used in setting loss reserves and the provision of risk management information and services. A material failure by an external service or information provider or a material defect in the products, services or information provided thereby could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to attract and retain qualified executives and employees or the loss of any of these personnel could negatively impact our business.\nOur ability to execute on our business strategies depend on the retention and recruitment of qualified executives and other professionals. We rely substantially upon the services of our current executive team. In addition to these officers, we require key staff with risk mitigation, structured finance, insurance, credit, investment, accounting, finance, legal and technical skills. As a result of Ambac\u2019s financial situation and the rehabilitation proceedings for the Segregated Account, there is a higher risk that executive officers and other key staff will leave the Company and replacements may not be motivated to join the Company. The loss of the services of members of our senior management team or our inability to hire and retain other talented personnel could delay or prevent us from succeeding in executing our strategies, which could further negatively impact our business.\nThe insurance intangible asset, which resulted from the application of fresh start accounting, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, we applied fresh start accounting pursuant to which an insurance intangible and goodwill asset were recorded. The insurance intangible asset represented the difference between the fair value and aggregate carrying value of the financial guarantee insurance and reinsurance assets and liabilities. The insurance intangible asset is amortized using a level yield method based on actual and projected par exposure of the related financial guarantee insurance and reinsurance contracts. Significant declines in actual or projected par exposure could accelerate the insurance\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 24 2015 FORM 10-K |\nintangible amortization and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe excess reorganization value over the fair value of identified tangible and intangibles assets was reported as goodwill at the fresh start reporting date. The determination of reorganization value and fair value of assets and liabilities was dependent on various estimates and assumptions, including financial projections and the realization of certain events. All goodwill was assigned to the financial guarantee reporting unit, which primarily represents Ambac Assurance Corporation and its subsidiaries. An impairment test at September 30, 2015 indicated the implied fair value of goodwill was zero. As a result, the Company recorded a full non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge for the full carrying value.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nCertain surplus notes or other obligations issued by either Ambac Assurance or the Segregated Account may be characterized as equity of Ambac Assurance and as a result, Ambac Assurance may no longer be a member of the U.S. federal income tax consolidated group of which Ambac is the common parent.\nIt is possible that certain surplus notes or other obligations issued by either Ambac Assurance or the Segregated Account may be characterized as equity of Ambac Assurance for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If such surplus notes or other obligations are characterized as equity of Ambac Assurance and it is determined that such \u201cequity\u201d represented more than twenty percent of the total value of the stock of Ambac Assurance, Ambac Assurance may no longer be characterized as an includable corporation that is affiliated with Ambac. As a result, Ambac Assurance may no longer be characterized as a member of the U.S. federal income tax consolidated group of which Ambac is the common parent (the \u201cAmbac Consolidated Group\u201d) and Ambac Assurance would be required to file a separate consolidated tax return as the common parent of a new U.S. federal income tax consolidated group including Ambac Assurance as the new common parent and Ambac Assurance\u2019s affiliated subsidiaries (the \u201cAmbac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group\u201d).\nTo the extent Ambac Assurance is no longer a member of the Ambac Consolidated Group, Ambac Assurance\u2019s NOLs (and certain other available tax attributes of Ambac Assurance and the other members of the Ambac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group) may no longer be available for use by the Ambac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group or any of the remaining members of the Ambac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group to reduce the U.S. federal income tax liabilities of the Ambac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group. Ambac, Ambac Assurance and their affiliates entered into a tax sharing agreement that would require Ambac to make certain tax elections that could mitigate the loss of NOLs and other tax attributes resulting from a deconsolidation of Ambac Assurance from the Ambac Consolidated Group. However, in the event of a deconsolidation, certain other benefits resulting from U.S. federal income tax consolidation may no longer be available to the Ambac Consolidated Group including certain favorable rules relating to transactions occurring between members of the Ambac Consolidated Group and members of the Ambac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group.\nIf surplus notes or other obligations are characterized as equity of Ambac Assurance, the Ambac Assurance NOLs (and certain other tax attributes or tax benefits of the Ambac Consolidated\nGroup) may be subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Tax Code.\nIt is possible that certain surplus notes or other obligations may be characterized as equity of Ambac Assurance for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such characterization could result in an \u201cownership change\u201d of Ambac Assurance for purposes of Section 382 of the Tax Code. If such an ownership change were to occur, the value and amount of the Ambac Assurance NOLs would be substantially impaired, increasing the U.S. federal income tax liability of Ambac Assurance and materially reducing the value of Ambac Assurance\u2019s stock owned by Ambac and the potential of future cash tolling or dividend payments from Ambac Assurance to Ambac.\nDeductions with respect to interest accruing on certain surplus notes may be eliminated or deferred until payment.\nTo the extent certain surplus notes are characterized as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, accrued interest will not be deductible by Ambac Assurance. In addition, even if such surplus notes are characterized as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the deduction of interest accruing on such surplus notes may be deferred until paid or eliminated in part depending upon (i) the terms of any deferral and payment provisions provided in such surplus notes, (ii) whether such surplus notes have \u201csignificant original issue discount,\u201d and (iii) the yield to maturity of surplus notes. To the extent deductions with respect to interest are eliminated or deferred, the U.S. federal income tax of the members of the Ambac Consolidated Group or the members of the Ambac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group as the case maybe, could be increased reducing the amount of cash available to pay its obligations.", "PERMNO": 76757, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "AMBC"}
