Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks before you decide to buy shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition would likely suffer. In such case, the trading price of our common stock would decline, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our stock.\nThis and other public reports may contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about us and our industry. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those more fully described below and elsewhere in our public reports. We do not undertake to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.\nDisruptions in the financial markets have created uncertainty and deteriorating economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and our business.\nThe financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia continue to be volatile. The tightening of credit in financial markets, continuation or worsening of the current economic conditions, a prolonged global, national or regional economic recession or other similar events could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and on our sales, pricing and profitability. We are unable to predict the likely duration of these adverse economic conditions and the impact these events may have on our operations and the laboratory furniture industry in general.\nIf we fail to compete effectively, our revenue and profit margins could decline.\nWe face a variety of competition in all of the markets in which we participate. Competitive pricing, including price competition or the introduction of new products, could have material adverse effects on our revenues and profit margins.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on the specification or approval of our products by architects, engineers, and customers. If a significant segment of those communities were to decide that the design, materials, manufacturing, testing, or quality control of our products is inferior to that of any of our competitors, our sales and profits would be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we lose a large customer, our sales and profits would decline.\nWe have substantial sales to our national stocking distributor and two of our Americas dealers. The combined sales to these three customers accounted for approximately 36% of our sales in fiscal year 2015. Loss of all or a part of our sales to a large customer would have a material effect on our revenues and profits.\nAn increase in the price of raw materials and energy could negatively affect our sales and profits.\nIt is common in the laboratory and healthcare furniture industries for customers to require delivery at extended future dates, as products are frequently to be installed in buildings yet to be constructed. Since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry, we bear the burden of possible increases in labor, material and energy costs between the quotation of an order and the delivery of the products. Our principal raw materials are steel, including stainless steel, wood and epoxy resin. Numerous factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, competition, worldwide demand, labor costs, energy costs, and import duties and other trade restrictions, influence prices for our raw materials. We have not always been able, and in the future we might not be able, to increase our product prices in amounts that correspond to increases in costs of raw materials, without materially and adversely affecting our sales and profits. Where we are not able to increase our prices, increases in our raw material costs will adversely affect our profitability.\nOur future growth may depend on our ability to penetrate new international markets.\nInternational laws and regulations, construction customs, standards, techniques and methods differ from those in the United States. Significant challenges of conducting business in foreign countries include, among other factors, local acceptance of our products, political instability, currency controls, changes in import and export regulations, changes in tariff and freight rates and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nEvents outside our control may affect our operating results.\nWe have little control over the timing of shipping customer orders, as customers\u2019 required delivery dates are subject to change by the customer. Construction delays and customer changes to product designs are among the factors that may delay the start of manufacturing and shipments of orders. Shipments that we anticipate in one quarter may occur in another quarter, affecting both quarters\u2019 results. Weather conditions, such as unseasonably warm, cold, or wet weather, can also affect and sometimes delay projects. Political and economic events can also affect our revenues. When sales do not meet our expectations, our operating results will be reduced for the relevant quarters.\nOur principal markets are in the laboratory building construction industry. This industry is subject to significant volatility due to various factors, none of which is within our control. Declines in construction activity or demand for our products could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe depend on key management and technical personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business.\nWe depend on certain key management and technical personnel. The loss of one or more key employees may materially and adversely affect us. Our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical, marketing, and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of our activities. We might not be able to attract or retain such personnel.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile and could drop.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variation in operating results, announcement of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, general conditions in the construction and construction materials industries, relatively low trading volume in our common stock and other events or factors. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. Securities market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to other risks that might also cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecasts, targets, or projections, including:\n\u2022\nFailing to anticipate the need for, appropriately invest in and effectively manage the human, information technology and logistical resources necessary to support our business, including managing the costs associated with such resources;\n\u2022\nFailing to generate sufficient future positive operating cash flows and, if necessary, secure adequate external financing to fund our growth; and\n\u2022\nInterruptions in service by common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels.", "PERMNO": 47571, "SIC": 3821, "TIC": "KEQU"}
