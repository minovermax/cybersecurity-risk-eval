RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and cash flows. These could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally which are not specifically mentioned below.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe prices for oil and natural gas affect the level of capital spending by our customers. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and natural gas prices could result in lower capital spending by our customers.\nPrices for crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile and extremely sensitive to the respective supply/demand relationship for crude oil and natural gas. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Many factors affect the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas and, therefore, influence prices of these commodities, including:\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, including increased availability of non-traditional energy resources such as shale oil and natural gas\u037e\n\u2022\nprices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas\u037e\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide economic conditions, and the resulting global demand for oil and natural gas\u037e\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas including the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels for oil, and decisions by OPEC to change production levels\u037e\n\u2022\nsanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), or other governments against oil producing countries;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas\u037e\n\u2022\nthe level of excess production capacity, available pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity\u037e\n\u2022\nlead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel\u037e\n\u2022\nthe expected rates of decline in production from existing and prospective wells\u037e\n\u2022\nthe discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves\u037e\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local regulation of (i) exploration and drilling activities, (ii) equipment, material, supplies or services that we furnish and (iii) oil and natural gas exports\u037e\n\u2022\npublic pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate hydraulic fracturing (fracking) activities\u037e\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including hurricanes, that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area and severe winter weather that can interfere with oil and natural gas development and production operations\u037e\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and social unrest in oil and natural gas producing countries\u037e\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption (such as fracking)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuel and energy sources\u037e\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nuncertainty in capital and commodities markets\u037e and\n\u2022\nchanges in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other global currencies.\nDemand for our products and services depends substantially on capital spending by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. A prolonged material downturn in crude oil and natural gas prices and/or perceptions of long-term lower commodity prices can negatively impact the development plans of exploration and production (E&P) companies and result in a significant decline in demand for offshore support services resulting in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. Moreover, declining or continuing depressed oil and natural gas prices may result in negative pressures on:\n\u2022\nour customer\u2019s capital spending and spending on our services;\n\u2022\nour charter rates and/or utilization rates;\n\u2022\nour results of operations, cash flows and financial condition;\n\u2022\nthe fair market value of our vessels;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance, maintain or increase our borrowing capacity;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and make acquisitions or capital expenditures, and the cost of that capital\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe collectability of our receivables.\nMoreover, higher commodity prices will not necessarily translate into increased demand for offshore support services or sustained higher pricing for offshore support vessel services, in part because customer demand is based on future commodity price expectations and not solely on current prices. Additionally, increased commodity demand may in the future be satisfied by land-based energy resource production and any increased demand for offshore support vessel services can be more than offset by an increased supply of offshore support vessels resulting from the construction of additional offshore support vessels.\nCrude oil pricing volatility has increased in recent years as crude oil has emerged as a widely-traded financial asset class. To the extent speculative trading of crude oil causes excessive crude oil pricing volatility, our results of operations could potentially be negatively impacted if such price volatility affects spending and investment decisions of offshore exploration, development and production companies.\nWe derive a significant amount of revenue from a relatively small number of customers.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, periods from August 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 (Successor), April 1, 2017 through July 31, 2017 (Predecessor), and the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 (Predecessor), the five largest customers accounted for, in the aggregate, approximately 41%, 45%, 48% and 53%, respectively, of our total revenues, while the 10 largest customers accounted for, in the aggregate, approximately 58%, 64%, 69% and 75%, respectively, of our total revenues. While it is normal for our customer base to change over time as our time charter contracts expire and are replaced, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if the customer base contracts, or one or more of these customers were to decide to interrupt or curtail their activities, in general, or their activities with us, terminate their contracts with us, fail to renew existing contracts, and/or refuse to award new contracts.\nOur customer base has undergone consolidation, and additional consolidation is possible.\nOil and natural gas companies and other energy companies and energy services companies have undergone consolidation, and additional consolidation is possible. Consolidation reduces the number of customers for our equipment, and may negatively affect exploration, development and production activity as consolidated companies focus, at least initially, on increasing efficiency and reducing costs and may delay or abandon exploration activity with less promise. Such activity could adversely affect demand for our offshore services.\nThe high level of competition on the offshore marine service industry could negatively impact pricing for our services.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which could depress charter and utilization rates and adversely affect our financial performance. We compete for business with our competitors on the basis of price; reputation for quality service; quality, suitability and technical capabilities of our vessels; availability of vessels; safety and efficiency; cost of mobilizing vessels from one market to a different market; and national flag preference. In addition, competition in international markets may be adversely affected by regulations requiring, among other things, local construction, flagging, ownership or control of vessels, the awarding of contracts to local contractors, the employment of local citizens and/or the purchase of supplies from local vendors.\nThe rise in production of unconventional crude oil and natural gas resources could increase supply without a commensurate growth in demand which would negatively impact oil and natural gas prices.\nThe rise in production of unconventional crude oil and natural gas resources in North America and the commissioning of a number of new large Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) export facilities around the world have contributed to an over-supplied natural gas market. Production from unconventional resources has increased as drilling efficiencies have improved, lowering the costs of extraction. There has also been a buildup of crude oil inventories in the U.S. in part due to the increased development of unconventional crude oil resources. Prolonged increases in the worldwide supply of crude oil and natural gas, whether from conventional or unconventional sources, without a commensurate growth in demand for crude oil and natural gas will likely continue to weigh crude oil and natural gas prices. A prolonged period of low crude oil and natural gas prices would likely have a negative impact on development plans of exploration and production companies, which in turn, may result in a decrease in demand for our offshore support vessel services.\nUncertain economic conditions may lead our customers to postpone capital spending.\nUncertainty about future global economic market conditions makes it challenging to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. The success of our business is both directly and indirectly dependent upon conditions in the global financial and credit markets that are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Uncertain economic conditions may lead our customers to postpone capital spending in response to tighter credit markets and reductions in our customers\u2019 income or asset values. Similarly, when lenders and institutional investors reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide funding to corporate and other industrial borrowers, the liquidity and financial condition of our company and our customers can be adversely impacted. These factors may also adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. Factors such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation), trade barriers and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other countries, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls, and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts, security operations, and seaborne refugee issues) can have a material negative effect on our business, revenues and profitability.\nAn increase in vessel supply without a corresponding increase in the working offshore rig count could exacerbate the industry\u2019s currently oversupplied condition.\nOver the past decade, the combination of historically high commodity prices and technological advances resulted in significant growth in deepwater exploration, field development and production. During this time, construction of offshore vessels increased significantly in order to meet projected requirements of customers and potential customers. Excess offshore support vessel capacity usually exerts downward pressure on charter day rates. Excess capacity can occur when newly constructed vessels enter the worldwide offshore support vessel market and also when vessels migrate between markets. A discussion about our vessel fleet and vessel construction programs appears in the \u201cVessel Count, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Construction Programs\u201d section of Item 7 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAn increase in vessel capacity without a corresponding increase in the working offshore rig count could exacerbate the industry\u2019s currently oversupplied condition, which may have the effect of lowering charter rates and utilization rates, which, in turn, would result in lower revenues.\nIn addition, the provisions of U.S. shipping laws restricting engagement of U.S. coastwise trade to vessels controlled by U.S. citizens may from time to time be circumvented by foreign competitors that seek to engage in trade reserved for vessels controlled by U.S. citizens and otherwise qualifying for coastwise trade. A repeal, suspension or significant modification of U.S. shipping laws, or the administrative erosion of their benefits, permitting vessels that are either foreign-flagged, foreign-built, foreign-owned, foreign-controlled or foreign-operated to engage in the U.S. coastwise trade, could also result in excess vessel capacity and increased competition, especially for our vessels that operate in North America.\nWe operate in various regions throughout the world and are exposed to many risks inherent in doing business in countries other than the U.S.\nWe operate in various regions throughout the world and are exposed to many risks inherent in doing business in countries other than the U.S., subjecting us to complex and frequently changing laws and regulations. Our customary risks of operating internationally include political, social and economic instability within the host country; possible vessel seizures or expropriation of assets and other governmental actions by the host country, including trade or economic sanctions and enforcement of customs, immigration or other laws that are not well developed or consistently enforced; foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors; an inability to recruit, retain or obtain work visas for workers of international operations; deprivation of contract rights; difficulties or delays in collecting customer and other accounts receivable; changing taxation policies; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; foreign currency revaluations and devaluations; restrictions on converting foreign currencies into U.S. dollars; expatriating customer and other payments made in jurisdictions outside of the U.S.; civil unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict; and import/export quotas and restrictions or other trade barriers, most of which are beyond our control. See Note (7) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have substantial operations in Brazil, Mexico, the North Sea, Norway, Southeast Asia, Saudi Arabia, Angola, Nigeria and throughout the west coast of Africa, which generate a large portion of our revenue, where we are exposed to the risks described above.\nWar, sabotage, piracy, kidnappings and terrorism or any similar risk may put our personnel at risk and adversely affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including changes in the insurance markets, disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, refineries, electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, offshore rigs and vessels, and communications infrastructures, could be\ndirect targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of piracy, sabotage or terrorism. War or risk of war or any such attack may also have an adverse effect on the economy, which could adversely affect activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production and the demand for our services. Insurance coverage can be difficult to obtain in areas of pirate and terrorist attacks resulting in increased costs that could continue to increase. We periodically evaluate the need to maintain this insurance coverage as it applies to our fleet. Instability in the financial markets as a result of war, sabotage, piracy, and terrorism could also adversely affect our ability to raise capital and could also adversely affect the oil, natural gas and power industries and restrict their future growth. The increase in the level of these criminal or terrorist acts over the last several years has been well-publicized. As a marine services company that operates in offshore, coastal or tidal waters in challenging areas, we are particularly vulnerable to these kinds of unlawful activities. Although we take what we consider to be prudent measures to protect our personnel and assets in markets that present these risks, including solicitation of advice from third-party experts, we have confronted these kinds of incidents in the past, and there can be no assurance we will not be subjected to them in the future.\nWe are subject to complex and frequently changing laws and regulation, including those involving anti-slavery and other human rights law, labor laws and regulations relating to the protection of certain information that we collect and maintain about our employees, clients, and other third parties. Among these laws is the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) Modern Slavery Act of 2015, the U.K. Bribery Act, and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect in May 2018. The failure to comply with these laws or regulations could subject us to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, or fines in one or more jurisdictions.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a large extent, is subject to conditions in the oil and natural gas industry, including commodity prices, demand for our services and the prices we are able to charge for our services, general economic and financial conditions, competition in the markets in which we operate, the impact of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control.\nLower levels of offshore exploration and development activity and spending by our customers globally directly and significantly impacted our financial performance, financial condition and financial outlook.\nRestrictive covenants in our Indenture and our amended and restated Troms credit agreement may restrict our ability to raise capital and pursue our business strategies.\nThe Indenture and the amended and restated Troms credit agreement contain certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of debt and liens and our ability to make investments and restricted payments. These covenants limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and lease back transactions;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nmake certain capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock.\nThe Indenture and the amended and restated Troms credit agreement also require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including maintenance of minimum liquidity and, commencing June 30, 2019, compliance with a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. We may be unable to meet these financial covenants or comply with these restrictive covenants, which could result in a default under our Indenture or the amended and restated Troms credit agreement. If a default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or noteholders holding at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding notes under the Indenture and the lenders under the amended and restated Troms credit agreement may elect to declare all borrowings thereunder outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the noteholders and the lenders under the amended and restated Troms credit agreement will also have the right to foreclose on the collateral pledged to them, including the vessels, to secure the indebtedness. If such indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be\nsufficient to repay in full our secured indebtedness. Please refer to Note (9) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Indenture and amended and restated Troms credit agreement.\nAs a result of the restrictive covenants under the Indenture and the amended and restated Troms credit agreement, we may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities. In addition, the restrictions contained in the Indenture and the amended and restated Troms credit agreement, including a substantial make whole premium in the Indenture, may also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, refinance, enter into acquisitions, execute our business strategy, make capital expenditures, effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted or engage in other business activities that would be in our interest. In the future, we may also incur additional debt obligations that might subject us to additional and different restrictive covenants that could further affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements, or that we will be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe amount of our debt, including secured debt, and the restrictive covenants in our Indenture and the amended and restated Troms credit agreement could have significant consequences for our operations and future prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $439 million of debt. Our level of indebtedness, and the restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt, could have important consequences for our operations, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the agreements governing our indebtedness and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;\n\u2022\nrequiring that we pledge substantial collateral, including vessels which may limit flexibility in operating our business and restrict our ability to sell assets;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, general corporate purposes and other activities;\n\u2022\nlimiting management\u2019s flexibility in operating our business;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\ndiminishing our ability to successfully withstand a further downturn in our business or further worsening of macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to invest in new vessels and to make other capital expenditures.\nWe may not be able to obtain debt financing if and when needed with favorable terms, if at all.\nIf commodity prices remain depressed or decline or if E&P companies continue to de-prioritize investments in offshore exploration, development and production, there could be a general outflow of credit and capital from the energy and energy services sectors and/or offshore focused energy and energy service companies, as well as further efforts by lenders to reduce their loan exposure to the energy sector, impose increased lending standards for the energy and energy services sectors, increase borrowing costs and collateral requirements or refuse to extend new credit or amend existing credit facilities in the energy and energy services sectors. These potential negative consequences may be exacerbated by the pressure exerted on financial institutions by bank regulatory agencies to respond quickly and decisively to credit risk that develops in distressed industries. All of these factors may complicate the ability of borrowers to achieve a favorable outcome in negotiating solutions to even marginally stressed credits.\nThese factors could limit our ability to access debt markets, including for the purpose of refinancing or replacing our existing debt, cause us to refinance at increased interest rates, issue debt or enter into bank credit agreements with less favorable\nterms and conditions, which debt may require additional collateral and contain more restrictive terms, negatively impact current and prospective customers\u2019 willingness to transact business with us, or impose additional insurance, guarantee and collateral requirements, all of which result in higher borrowing costs and may limit our long- and short-term financial flexibility.\nAs the markets recover, we change our marketing strategies or for other reasons, we may be required to incur higher than expected costs to return previously stacked vessels to active service.\nStacked vessels are not maintained with the same diligence as our marketed fleet. Depending on the length of time the vessels are stacked, we may incur costs beyond normal drydock costs to return these vessels to active service. These costs are difficult to estimate and may be substantial.\nMaintaining our current fleet size and configuration and acquiring vessels required for additional future growth require significant capital.\nExpenditures required for the repair, certification and maintenance of a vessel typically increase with vessel age. These expenditures may increase to a level at which they are not economically justifiable and, therefore, to maintain our current fleet size we may seek to construct or acquire additional vessels. Also, customers may prefer modern vessels over older vessels, especially in weaker markets. The cost of adding a new vessel to our fleet can be substantial.\nWhile we expect our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our long-term debt arrangement to be adequate to fund our future potential purchases of additional vessels, our ability to pay these amounts is dependent upon the success of our operations. We can give no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to build or acquire the vessels required to expand or to maintain our current fleet size and vessel configuration.\nWe may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for our vessels.\nWe have a number of charters that will expire in 2019. Our ability to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts, will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the specific needs of our customers. Given the highly competitive and historically cyclical nature of our industry, we may not be able to renew or replace the contracts or we may be required to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts at rates that are below, and potentially substantially below, existing day rates, or that have terms that are less favorable to us than our existing contracts, or we may be unable to secure contracts for these vessels. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe early termination of contracts on our vessels could have an adverse effect on our operations and our backlog may not be converted to actual operating results for any future period.\nMost of the long-term contracts for our vessels and all contracts with governmental entities and national oil companies contain early termination options in favor of the customer, in some cases permitting termination for any reason. Although some of these contracts have early termination remedies in our favor or other provisions designed to discourage the customers from exercising such options, we cannot assure you that our customers would not choose to exercise their termination rights in spite of such remedies or the threat of litigation with us. Moreover, most of the contracts for our vessels have a term of one year or less and can be terminated with 90 days or less notice. Unless such vessels can be placed under contract with other customers, any termination could temporarily disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We might not be able to replace such business or replace it on economically equivalent terms. In those circumstances, the amount of backlog could be reduced and the conversion of backlog into revenue could be impaired. Additionally, because of depressed commodity prices, adverse changes in credit markets, economic downturns, changes in priorities or strategy or other factors beyond our control, a customer may no longer want or need a vessel that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at a lower rate. For these reasons, customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of our existing contracts, terminate our contracts without justification or repudiate or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under our contracts. In any case, an early termination of a contract may result in our vessel being idle for an extended period of time. Each of these results could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may record additional losses or impairment charges related to our vessels.\nWe review the vessels in our active fleet for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable and we also perform a review of our stacked vessels not expected to return to active service whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a vessel may not be recoverable. We have recorded impairment charges of $61.1 million, $16.8 million, $184.7 million and $484.7 million, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the period from August 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 (Successor), the period from April 1, 2017 through July 31, 2017 (Predecessor) and the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2017 (Predecessor), respectively. In the event that offshore E&P industry conditions further deteriorate, or persist at current levels, we could be subject to additional vessel impairments in future periods. An impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over the estimated fair value. As part of this analysis, we make assumptions and estimates regarding future market conditions. To the extent actual results do not meet our estimated assumptions we may take an impairment loss in the future. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will not have to take additional impairment charges in the future if the currently depressed market conditions persist.\nWe may not be able to sell vessels to improve our cash flow and liquidity because we may be unable to locate buyers with access to financing or to complete any sales on acceptable terms or within a reasonable timeframe.\nWe may seek to sell some of our vessels to provide liquidity and improve our cash flow. However, given the current downturn in the oil and natural gas industry, there may not be sufficient activity in the market to sell our vessels and we may not be able to identify buyers with access to financing or to complete any such sales. Even if we are able to locate appropriate buyers for our vessels, any sales may occur on significantly less favorable terms than the terms that might be available in a more liquid market or at other times in the business cycle.\nThere are uncertainties in identifying and integrating acquisitions and mergers.\nAlthough acquisitions have historically been an element of our business strategy, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. We may be required to use our cash, issue equity securities, or incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions or mergers. Any of these options could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available to us on unfavorable terms, if at all.\nSuch additional debt service requirements may impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and any equity issuance could have a dilutive impact on our stockholders. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully consolidate the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business. Acquisitions may not perform as expected when the transaction was consummated and may be dilutive to our overall operating results. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results. Moreover, our management may not be able to effectively manage a substantially larger business or successfully operate a new line of business.\nWe may not be able to successfully enter or grow a new line of business.\nHistorically, our operations and acquisitions focused primarily on offshore marine vessel services for the oil and natural gas industry. Entry into, or further development of, lines of business in which we have not historically operated may expose us to business and operational risks that are different from those we have experienced historically. Our management may not be able to effectively manage these additional risks or implement successful business strategies in new lines of business. Additionally, our competitors in these lines of business may possess substantially greater operational knowledge, resources and experience.\nWe may have disruptions or disagreements with our foreign joint venture partners, which could lead to an unwinding of the joint venture.\nWe operate in several foreign areas through joint ventures with local companies, in some cases as a result of local laws requiring local company ownership. While the joint venture partner may provide local knowledge and experience, entering into joint ventures often requires us to surrender a measure of control over the assets and operations devoted to the joint venture, and occasions may arise when we do not agree with the business goals and objectives of our joint venture partner, or other factors may arise that make the continuation of the relationship unwise or untenable. Any such disagreements or discontinuation of the relationship could disrupt our operations, put assets dedicated to the joint venture at risk, or affect the\ncontinuity of our business. If we are unable to resolve issues with a joint venture partner, we may decide to terminate the joint venture and either locate a different partner and continue to work in the area or seek opportunities for our assets in another market. The unwinding of an existing joint venture could prove to be difficult or time-consuming, and the loss of revenue related to the termination or unwinding of a joint venture and costs related to the sourcing of a new partner or the mobilization of assets to another market could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Please refer to Note (7) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of our Sonatide joint venture in Angola and our joint venture in Nigeria, respectively.\nOur international operations expose us to currency devaluation and fluctuation risk.\nAs a global company, our international operations are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks on all charter hire contracts denominated in foreign currencies. For some of our international contracts, a portion of the revenue and local expenses is incurred in local currencies and we are at risk of changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies. In some instances, we receive payments in currencies that are not easily traded and may be illiquid. We generally do not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business, which exposes us to the risk of exchange rate losses. Gains and losses from the revaluation of our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in our consolidated statements of operations. Foreign currency fluctuations may cause the U.S. dollar value of our non-U.S. results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations. This could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.\nTo minimize the financial impact of these items, we attempt to contract a significant majority of our services in U.S. dollars and, when feasible, we attempt to not maintain large, non-U.S. dollar-denominated cash balances. In addition, we attempt to minimize the financial impact of these risks by matching the currency of our operating costs with the currency of revenue streams when considered appropriate. We monitor the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in U.S. dollars.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Sonatide maintained the equivalent of approximately $20 million of Angolan kwanza-denominated deposits in Angolan banks, largely related to customer receipts that had not yet been converted to U.S. dollars, expatriated and then remitted to us. A devaluation in the Angolan kwanza relative to the U.S. dollar would result in foreign exchange losses for Sonatide to the extent the Angolan kwanza-denominated asset balances were in excess of kwanza-denominated liabilities. Under the current joint venture structure, we would bear 49% of any potential losses.\nOur insurance coverage and contractual indemnity protections may not be sufficient to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks.\nOur operations are subject to the hazards inherent in the offshore oilfield business. These include blowouts, explosions, fires, collisions, capsizings, sinkings, groundings and severe weather conditions. Some of these events could be the result of (or exacerbated by) mechanical failure or navigation or operational errors. These hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment (including to the property and equipment of third parties), pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations, increased costs and loss of business. Damages arising from such occurrences may result in lawsuits alleging large claims, and we may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards.\nWe carry what we consider to be prudent levels of liability insurance, and our vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss, including war, terrorism acts and pollution risks. While we maintain insurance protection and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us harmless from some of these risks, our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. Our insurance coverages are subject to deductibles and certain exclusions. We do not directly or fully insure for business interruption. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, while we believe that we should be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates considered commercially acceptable, we cannot guarantee that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially acceptable rates given the markets in which we operate.\nIn addition, our contracts are individually negotiated, and the levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities in them can vary from contract to contract depending on market conditions, particular customer requirements and other factors existing at the time a contract is negotiated. Additionally, the enforceability of indemnification provisions in our contracts may be limited or prohibited by applicable law or may not be enforced by courts having jurisdiction, and we could be held liable for substantial losses or\ndamages and for fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities. The law with respect to the enforceability of indemnities varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Current or future litigation in particular jurisdictions, whether or not we are a party, may impact the interpretation and enforceability of indemnification provisions in our contracts. There can be no assurance that our contracts with our customers, suppliers and subcontractors will fully protect us against all hazards and risks inherent in our operations. There can also be no assurance that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify us will be financially able to do so or will otherwise honor their contractual obligations.\nWith our extensive international operations, we are subject to certain compliance risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act or similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nOur global operations require us to comply with a number of complex U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery and, anti-corruption. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit. We have adopted proactive procedures to promote compliance with the FCPA, but we may be held liable for actions taken by local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may themselves not be subject to the FCPA. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA (or any other applicable anti-bribery laws in countries in which we do business) could have a material adverse effect on our business and business reputation, as well as our results of operations, and cash flows. We operate in many parts of the world where governmental corruption is present and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices and impact our business. Although we have programs in place covering compliance with anti-bribery legislation, any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject us to civil and criminal penalties or other fines or sanctions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling rigs or other assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe U.K.\u2019s referendum to exit from the E.U. will have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted to exit from the E.U. (commonly referred to as Brexit). The terms of Brexit and the resulting U.K./E.U. relationship are uncertain for companies doing business both in the U.K. and the overall global economy. In addition, our business and operations may be impacted by any subsequent E.U. member withdrawals and a vote in Scotland to seek independence from the U.K. Risks related to Brexit that we may encounter include:\n\u2022\nadverse impact on macroeconomic growth and oil and natural gas demand;\n\u2022\ncontinued volatility in currencies including the British pound and USD that may impact our financial results;\n\u2022\nreduced demand for our services in the U.K. and globally;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of doing business in the U.K. and in the North Sea;\n\u2022\nincreased regulatory costs and challenges for operating our business in the North Sea;\n\u2022\nvolatile capital and debt markets, and access to other sources of capital;\n\u2022\nrisks related to our global tax structure and the tax treaties upon which we rely;\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory uncertainty and potentially divergent treaties, laws and regulations between the E.U. and U.K.\n\u2022\nbusiness uncertainty and instability resulting from prolonged political negotiations; and\n\u2022\nuncertain stability of the E.U. and global economy if other countries exit the E.U.\nThere may be changes to, complex and developing laws and regulations to which we are subject that would increase our cost of compliance and operational risk.\nOur operations are subject to many complex and burdensome laws and regulations. Stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and the manning, construction and operation of vessels significantly affect our operations. Many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and their foreign equivalents; as well as to standards imposed by private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping, the Oil Companies International Marine Forum, and the International Marine Contractors Association.\nFurther, many of the countries in which we operate have laws, regulations and enforcement systems that are less well developed than the laws, regulations and enforcement systems of the U.S., and the requirements of these systems are not always readily discernible even to experienced and proactive participants. These countries\u2019 laws can be unclear, and, the application and enforcement of these laws and regulations can be unpredictable and subject to frequent change or reinterpretation. Sometimes governments may apply such changes or reinterpretations with retroactive effect, and may impose associated taxes, fees, fines or penalties based on that reinterpretation or retroactive effect. While we endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our compliance efforts might not always be wholly successful, and failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions, imposition of remedial obligations or the suspension or termination of our operations. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others, including charterers or third party agents. Moreover, these laws and regulations could be changed or be interpreted in new, unexpected ways that substantially increase costs that we may not be able to pass along to our customers. Any changes in laws, regulations or standards imposing additional requirements or restrictions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe operate in the U.S. and globally, and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe operate in the U.S. and globally through various subsidiaries which are subject to changes in applicable tax laws, treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, including laws or policies directed toward companies organized in jurisdictions with low tax rates. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial results. We determine our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in each jurisdiction for the period during which we operate and earn income. A material change in the tax laws, tax treaties, regulations or accounting principles, or interpretation thereof, in one or more countries in which we conduct business, or in which we are incorporated or a resident of, could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings, and such change could be significant to our financial results. In addition, our overall effective tax rate could be adversely and suddenly affected by lower than anticipated earnings in countries with lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries with higher statutory rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover, our worldwide operations may change in the future such that the mix of our income and losses recognized in the various jurisdictions could change. Any such changes could reduce our ability to utilize tax benefits, such as foreign tax credits, and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and tax expense.\nThe majority of our revenues and net income are generated by our operations outside of the U.S. Our effective tax rate has historically averaged approximately 30% until recent years where the decline of the oil and natural gas market significantly impacted our operations and overall effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the current year is negative due to our full valuation allowance position in the U.S. and foreign taxes paid in local jurisdictions compared to our significant net operating loss.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The changes included in the Tax Act were broad and complex. The final transition impacts of the Tax Act did not materially differ from the estimates provided in the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017. We continue to monitor the impact of the Tax Act on our ongoing operations. The impact of the Tax Act on our financial position in future periods could be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, or any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country\u2019s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting reporting requirements (\u201cBEPS\") recommended by the G8, G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\").] As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.\nIn addition, our income tax returns are subject to review and examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities where tax returns are filed. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. We do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority. If any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure or intercompany transfer pricing policies, or if the terms of certain income tax treaties were to be interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure, or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny changes in environmental regulations could increase the cost of energy and future production of oil and natural gas.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that control the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection. Compliance with such laws and regulations may require installation of costly equipment, increased manning or operational changes. Some environmental laws impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault.\nA variety of regulatory developments, proposals and requirements have been introduced (and in some cases enacted) in the U.S. and various other countries that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases. Notwithstanding the current downturn in the oil industry punctuated by lessened demand and lower oil prices, any such regulations could ultimately result in the increased cost of energy as well as environmental and other costs, and capital expenditures could be necessary to comply with the limitations. These developments may have an adverse effect on future production and demand for hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our offshore support vessels and other assets, which are highly dependent on the level of activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production markets. In addition, the increased regulation of environmental emissions may create greater incentives for the use of alternative energy sources. Unless and until regulations are implemented and their effects are known, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate their impact on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to compete. However, any long term material adverse effect on the crude oil and natural gas industry may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdoption of climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions could increase the cost of energy and future production of oil and natural gas.\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. These requirements could make our customer\u2019s products more expensive and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas, any of which may reduce demand for our services.\nWe may be subject to additional unionization efforts, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages.\nIn locations in which we are required to do so, including in the U.K., Norway, Nigeria, and the U.S. (collectively, about 30% of our employees), we have union workers, subject to collective bargaining agreements, that are periodically in negotiation. These negotiations could result in higher personnel expenses, other increased costs, or increased operational restrictions. Disputes over the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with the unions that represent our employees under these agreements could result in strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers. Further, efforts have been made from time to time to unionize other portions of our workforce, including our U.S. GOM employees. Additional unionization efforts, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our costs and operating restrictions, disrupt our operations, reduce our revenues, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, or limit our flexibility.\nOur participation in industry-wide, multi-employer, defined benefit pension plans expose it to potential future losses.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are participating employers in two industry-wide, multi-employer defined benefit pension plans in the U.K., the U.K. Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (\u201cMNOPF\u201d) and the U.K. Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (\u201cMNRPF\u201d). Among other risks associated with multi-employer plans, contributions and unfunded obligations of the multi-employer plan are shared by the plan participants. As a result, we may inherit unfunded obligations if other plan participants withdraw from the plan or cease to participate, and in the event that we withdraw from participation in one or both of these plans, we may be required to pay the plan an amount based on our allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan. Depending on the results of future actuarial valuations, it is possible that the plans could experience further deficits that will require funding from us, which would negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our employees are covered by federal laws that may subject us to job-related claims in addition to those provided by state laws.\nCertain of our employees are covered by provisions of the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act and general maritime law. These laws preempt state workers\u2019 compensation laws and permit these employees and their representatives to pursue actions against employers for job-related incidents in federal courts based on tort theories. Because we are not generally protected by the damage limits imposed by state workers\u2019 compensation statutes for these types of claims, we may have greater exposure for any claims made by these employees.\nA failure in our financial or operational systems, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is dependent upon our financial and operational systems to process transactions, store confidential records and conduct vessel operations. If any of our financial, operational, or other systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee or other third party causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition, dependence upon automated systems (including those on board our vessels) may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee or other tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nCybersecurity attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nMany of our business and operational processes are heavily dependent on traditional and emerging technology systems to conduct day-to-day operations (including vessel operations), improve safety and efficiency and lower costs. We use computerized systems to help run our financial and operations sectors, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency and magnitude. These incidents may include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, phishing, credential attacks, unauthorized access to data and other advanced and sophisticated cybersecurity breaches and threats, including threats that increasingly target critical operations technologies and process control networks. Any cybersecurity attacks that affect our facilities or operations, our customers or any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber-attacks on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer such attacks or operational system failures. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur common stock is subject to restriction on foreign ownership and possible required divestiture by non-U.S. Citizen stockholders.\nCertain of our operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and are governed by the U.S. federal law commonly known as the Jones Act. The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of goods and passengers between points in the U.S. to vessels owned and controlled by \u201cU.S. Citizens\u201d as defined thereunder (which we refer to as U.S. Citizens). We could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of our common stock. Such loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws authorize our Board of Directors to establish with respect to any class or series of our capital stock certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to the transfer of shares, to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. In order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act, our Board of Directors has determined that, all non-U.S. citizens in the aggregate may own up to 24% of the outstanding shares of common stock and any individual non-U.S. Citizen may own up to 4.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018, less than 24% of our outstanding common stock was owned by non-U.S. Citizens. At and during such time that the permitted limit of ownership by non-U.S. Citizens is reached with respect to shares of common stock, as applicable, we will be unable to issue any further shares of such class of common stock or approve transfers of such class of common stock to non-U.S. Citizens. Any purported transfer of our common stock in violation of these ownership provisions will be ineffective to transfer the common stock or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with such common stock. The existence and enforcement of these requirements could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of our equity securities in the event that U.S. Citizens were unable to transfer our shares to non-U.S. Citizens. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, this ownership requirement could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control.\nThe market price of our securities is subject to volatility.\nUpon emergence from the Chapter 11 proceeding, our old common stock was canceled and we issued new common stock. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, and the level of trading that develops with our common stock may be affected by, numerous factors beyond our control such as, our limited trading history subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy, on occasion our securities are thinly traded, the lack of comparable historical financial information due to our adoption of fresh start accounting, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results, including those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBecause we currently have no plans to pay cash dividends or other distributions on our common stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe currently do not expect to pay any cash dividends or other distributions on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends or other distributions on our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and, if we elect to pay such dividends in the future, we may reduce or discontinue entirely the payment of such dividends thereafter at any time. The Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, agreements governing any existing and future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur and other contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders, and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, which could make us unable to fund our capital requirements.\nOur business and operations may consume cash more quickly than we anticipate potentially impairing our ability to make capital expenditures to maintain our fleet and other assets in suitable operating condition. If our cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient to fund capital expenditures, we would be required to further reduce these expenditures or to fund capital expenditures through debt or equity issuances or through alternative financing plans or selling assets. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our capital requirements. Our ability to raise debt or equity capital or to refinance or restructure existing debt arrangements will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, among other things. Any limitations in our ability to finance future capital expenditures may limit our ability to respond to changes in customer preferences, technological change and other market conditions, which may diminish our competitive position within our sector.\nIf we issue additional equity securities, existing stockholders will experience dilution. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock which could have rights and preferences senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our security holders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock or other securities, diluting their interest or being subject to rights and preferences senior to their own.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade or provide negative outlook on our securities or our industry, the price of our securities and our trading volume could decline.\nThe trading markets for our securities rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade or provide negative outlook on our securities or our industry or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our business or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause the price or trading volume of our securities to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions and limitations on foreign ownership in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated By-Laws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue, and determine the rights, powers and preferences of, one or more series of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to present matters for consideration at our annual meetings;\n\u2022\nlimitations on convening special stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition on stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nsupermajority vote of stockholders to amend certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\nlimitations on expanding the size of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nthe availability for issuance of additional shares of common stock; and\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of any natural person or entity that does not satisfy the citizenship requirements of the U.S. maritime laws to own, in the aggregate, more than 24% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and foreign ownership limitations could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and other securities. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nThe exercise of all or any number of outstanding warrants or the issuance of stock-based awards may dilute your holding of shares of our common stock.\nWe have a significant number of securities providing for the right to purchase of our common stock. Investors could be subject to increased dilution upon the exercise of our New Creditor Warrants and GLF Creditor Warrants for a nominal exercise price subject to Jones Act-related foreign ownership restrictions, and the exercise of our Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants and GLF Equity Warrants. During 2017, we issued 18,456,186 shares of common stock in the reorganized company, 2,432,432 Series A Warrants with a strike price of $57.06 per warrant, 2,629,657 Series B Warrants with a strike price of $62.28 per warrant and 11,543,814 New Creditor Warrants. In connection with the business combination, on November 15, 2018, we issued 8,464,290 shares of our common stock in exchange for shares of GulfMark common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the business combination, and reserved 4,359,285 shares of our common stock for the future exercise of GLF Creditor Warrants, GLF Equity Warrants and future vesting of GulfMark\u2019s stock awards outstanding. As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,220,857 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the New Creditor Warrants, with an exercise price of $0.001 per share; and 2,189,709 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of GLF Creditor Warrants. We also have up to 2,432,432, 2,629,657 and 861,310 shares of common stock\nissuable upon the exercise of the outstanding Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants and GLF Equity Warrants with exercise prices of $57.06, $62.28 and $100, respectively.\nUnexercised Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants will expire on July 31, 2023. Unexercised GLF Equity Warrants expire on November 14, 2024. Unexercised New Creditor Warrants expire on July 31, 2042 and unexercised GLF Creditor Warrants expire on November 14, 2042.\nAdditionally, a total of 3,048,877 and 924,351 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan and Legacy GulfMark Stock Incentive Plan as equity-based awards to employees, directors and certain other persons. As of December 31, 2018, 1,512,025 of restricted stock units have been granted under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan and 209,782 of restricted stock units have been granted under the Legacy GulfMark Stock Incentive Plan, all of which are subject to vesting requirements. The exercise of equity awards, including any restricted stock units that we may grant in the future, and the exercise of warrants and the subsequent sale of shares of common stock issued thereby, could have an adverse effect on the market for our common stock, including the price that an investor could obtain for their shares. Investors may experience dilution in the value of their investment upon the exercise of the warrants and any equity awards that may be granted or issued pursuant to the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan and the Legacy GulfMark Stock Incentive Plan.\nThere may be a limited trading market for our New Creditor Warrants and GLF Creditor Warrants, and you may have difficulty trading and obtaining quotations for New Creditor Warrants.\nWhile there are unsolicited quotes for our New Creditor Warrants on the OTC Pink Market, there is no market maker for this security on the OTC Pink Market, and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop. While the GLF Creditor Warrants trade on OTC QX market, there has been limited trading volume since the business combination. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your New Creditor Warrants or GLF Creditor Warrants at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your New Creditor Warrants or GLF Creditor Warrants. As a result, you may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our New Creditor Warrants or GLF Creditor Warrants. This severely limits the liquidity of our New Creditor Warrants and the GLF Creditor Warrants, and will likely reduce the market price of our New Creditor Warrants and the GLF Creditor Warrants.\nThere is no guarantee that the Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants and GLF Equity Warrants issued by us or assumed by us will become in the money, and unexercised warrants may expire with limited or no value. Further, the terms of such warrants may be amended.\nAs long as our stock price is below the strike price of each of the Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants and GLF Equity Warrants, ($57.06 per share for Series A Warrants, $62.28 per share for Series B Warrants and $100 per share for the GLF Equity Warrants), these warrants will have limited economic value, and they may expire with limited or no value. In addition, the warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least a certain percentage of the then-outstanding warrants originally issued to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the holders. Any material amendment to the terms of the warrant in a manner adverse to a holder would require holders of at least a certain percentage of the then outstanding warrants, but less than all holders, approve of such amendment.\nWe may not be able to maintain a listing of our common stock, Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants and GLF Equity Warrants on the NYSE or NYSE American.\nWe must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain the listing of our securities on the NYSE or NYSE American, as applicable. If we fail to meet any of the NYSE or NYSE American\u2019s continued listing standards, our common stock, Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants, or GLF Equity Warrants may be delisted. A delisting of our common stock, Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants, or GLF Equity Warrants may materially impair our stockholders\u2019 and warrantholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell our common stock, Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants, or GLF Equity Warrants and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of, the trading market for these securities. A delisting of our common stock, Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants or GLF Equity Warrants could significantly impair our ability to raise capital.\nRisks Related to Our Recent Business Combination\nWe recently combined our business with GulfMark Offshore, Inc. (the \u201cbusiness combination\u201d) resulting in the composition of our stockholder base and our Board of Directors changing.\nUpon our business combination with GulfMark, the composition of our stockholder base and our Board of Directors changed. Our Board now consists of ten directors, with a non-executive Chairman of the Board, two of whom have previously served on the Board of Directors of GulfMark. The current directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine our future. There is no guarantee that the current Board will pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, our strategic plans in the same manner as our prior Board of Directors. As a result, our future strategy and plans may differ materially from those of the past.\nWe may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other personnel in light of the business combination.\nThe success of our business depends on key personnel. Uncertainty about the effect of the business combination and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances of employees may impair our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including key GulfMark employees. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity. These uncertainties could affect our relationship with customers, vendors and other parties. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract, retain and motivate key personnel to the same extent as in the past.\nWe may be unable to integrate successfully our business with GulfMark\u2019s business and realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination.\nThe business combination combined two companies that previously operated as independent public companies. The combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations and GulfMark. In addition, we have incurred transaction-related and restructuring costs in connection with the business combination and will continue to incur such costs in connection with our integration of the businesses and GulfMark. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, reduce the cost synergies that we achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost synergies related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the business combination, and accordingly, any net synergies may not be achieved in the near term or at all. These integration expenses may result in us taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the business combination. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\ncombining the companies\u2019 corporate functions, operations, procedures and systems;\n\u2022\nintegrating the companies\u2019 administrative and information technology infrastructures including systems on information management, purchasing, accounting and finance, specifically the move from the legacy Tidewater system (Peoplesoft) to GulfMark\u2019s system (SAP), sales, billing, payroll and benefits, administration systems and regulatory compliance;\n\u2022\ndetermining whether and how to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\ncombining the businesses of Tidewater and GulfMark in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies anticipated to result from the business combination in the time frame currently anticipated, if at all, or incurring unexpected costs to realize such synergies;\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing the larger, more complex, combined company;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of, or the loss of momentum in ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures or policies;\n\u2022\nmaintaining existing agreements with customers, suppliers, talent and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, suppliers, talent and vendors;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the business combination; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the business combination and integrating GulfMark\u2019s businesses.", "PERMNO": 50606, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "TDW"}
