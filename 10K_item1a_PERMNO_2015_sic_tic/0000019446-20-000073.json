{"cik": "19446", "company": "CANTEL MEDICAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-09-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to or arising out of the nature of our businesses and general business, economic, financing, legal and other factors or conditions that may affect us. We provide the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our businesses, which we believe are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, or could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected or historical results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted global economic conditions and have affected our operations, supply chain, distribution, sales force, as well as the financial stability of hospitals and other customers, and could cause a reduction in all operative procedures, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. On March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared a national emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, governments around the world, including in the U.S., have implemented measures including quarantines, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, travel restrictions, business operation restrictions, school closures and other similar types of measures. The impact of the pandemic, while still evolving, has caused significant economic and financial uncertainty in the U.S. and around the world, generating concerns the effects will lead to a global recession or depression. Governments around the world are attempting to mitigate the economic impact by passing fiscal stimulus measures to assist monetarily with the impacts of COVID-19. Furthermore, variance in actions by governments around the world, economic or otherwise, could result in disparate impact on businesses, including our business, and lead to impactful geopolitical instability.\nWe are unable to assess the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our future results. Those impacts will depend on future developments that are highly unpredictable and uncertain, such as the severity and length of the pandemic and global actions in\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 10\nCantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nresponse thereto. Our existing insurance coverage will not provide protection for all of the COVID-19-related disruption that has occurred or may arise during this time. Our management team is focused on mitigating adverse effects of the pandemic, thereby shifting their focus from other priorities. Should these conditions worsen, or endure for an extended period of time, we may face operational and other risks that we faced prior to the pandemic but are elevated due to the disruption of the pandemic. We continue to assess our business operations and the impact COVID-19 may have on our financial results, but there are no assurances that such analysis will enable us to avoid or precisely forecast the impact or consequences of COVID-19, including business downturns and/or a recession. A recession or depression could materially affect our business, including but not limited to our future access to capital, and negatively impact the value of our stock.\nOur ability to manufacture products may be materially adversely impacted by COVID-19. Similar to many other employers in the U.S., we are requiring many employees to work remotely. We have continued to operate certain manufacturing facilities to date in compliance with federal, state and local orders regarding COVID-19. The health of our workforce is our top concern. Accordingly, our management team may have to enact further precautionary measures to minimize any impact to our employees. Should our ability to manufacture as a result of COVID-19 be impacted it may not be possible for us to manufacture certain products and we may not be able to obtain necessary products or components from our suppliers and vendors due to supply constraints. A reduction or interruption in any of our manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows which include, without limitation, our liquidity or access to, or cost of, credit. We are unable to quantify the full extent of the impact and cannot predict the ultimate consequences of COVID-19. Moreover, the continuation of manufacturing operations may be dependent upon adequate access to PPE. In the event that access to PPE is constrained, manufacturing operations may be impacted.\nOur sales have been materially adversely impacted by COVID-19. In March 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) recommended the postponement of elective procedures until further notice to preserve PPE. The American College of Surgeons (the \u201cACS\u201d), following CMS, called for hospitals to \u201cminimize, postpone or cancel\u201d elective procedures until the COVID-19 outbreak slows down. In April 2020, the President of the United States announced a plan that would allow elective surgeries to resume and the ACS released a guide for health care facilities preparing to resume elective surgery once the COVID-19 disease was under control in their respective areas. The postponement of elective surgeries has negatively impacted the demand for and sales of our products. We have sales representatives and service technicians that require the ability to meet with health care providers in person to discuss and service our products. Moreover, continuation of sales may be dependent upon adequate access to PPE in order to gain access to health care providers. In the event that access to PPE is constrained, sales may continue to be impacted. The \u201cshelter in place\u201d and \u201csocial distancing\u201d mandates have had and may continue to negatively affect demand by limiting the ability of our sales force to maintain their contact with health care personnel for an unknown period of time. There is also a risk that our customers will not be able to purchase our products or pay for such products on a timely basis, or at all. As a result, we are uncertain as to whether our sales force, distributors and customers will be able to increase or maintain current levels of sales or pricing, which could materially adversely impact our business now and in the future.\nWe face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical device industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies, many of which may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and are well-established. Some competitors have developed or may be expected to develop technologies or products that could compete with our products or that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, our competitors may achieve patent protection, regulatory approval or product commercialization that would limit our ability to compete with them. Additionally, the medical device markets in which we primarily participate are characterized by extensive research and development, new product introductions and product enhancements, rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. Developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales. Accordingly, our ability to compete is in part dependent on our ability to continually offer enhanced and improved products that meet the changing requirements of our customers. As such, we are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards. If we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe face continued competition in our endoscopy disposable procedure products from larger competitors. We have seen increased activity by our larger competitors to include infection prevention endoscopy disposable procedure products in their\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 11\nCantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nexisting market share and bundling agreements. As purchasing decisions continue to be consolidated with GPOs and in a smaller number of IDNs, competitors with broader portfolios will have a competitive advantage in offering a wider range of discounts. If such approach expands, we could face declines in growth or loss of market share, as well as reduced profit margin, for our endoscopy disposal procedural products.\nWe face increased competition in the water purification system market due to the alliance of kidney dialysis machine suppliers and water purification system suppliers. Outside of the U.S., we believe there is a trend in formal or informal bundling partnerships and arrangements between kidney dialysis machine suppliers and companies offering medical water purification systems that compete with our systems. The ability to bundle these products offers a competitive advantage to such suppliers, which include Baxter (dialysis machine)/Gambro (water system), B. Braun (dialysis machine)/Lauer (water system), and Fresenius (dialysis machine)/Vivonic (water system). The bundling approach being used by B. Braun/Lauer, and the business combination of Fresenius and Vivonic, represent competitive threats to our dialysis water business. If such business combinations and bundling approaches expand in the U.S. and we do not succeed in forming an alliance with a high-quality supplier of kidney dialysis machines, we can lose our current competitive advantages and experience a material loss of net sales and a decrease in margins in our water purification system business.\nThe market for our dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers. The decrease in the reuse portion of the dialysis market in the U.S. accelerated significantly in recent years and such decrease is expected to continue. Our dialyzer reprocessing products are limited to use by clinics that choose to clean, sterilize and reuse dialyzers, rather than discard the dialyzers after a single-use. Today, only a small number of all dialysis procedures in the U.S. reuse dialyzers. The downward trend in reuse dialyzers in the U.S. had accelerated in recent years which resulted in the sale of no reuse dialyzers in the U.S. for the past several fiscal years. Further, the most significant manufacturers of reuse dialyzers have indicated that they will be ceasing their manufacture of such products. As such, clinics that currently utilize reuse dialyzers will continue to convert to single use dialyzers, which will continue the downward trend and likely eliminate our sale of dialyzer reprocessors and related single-use products in the U.S. at some point in the near future. The reduction of our dialysis reuse business has had an adverse effect on our Dialysis segment business, which has reduced our margins and net income in this segment.\nWe face significant challenges in growing our dialysate concentrate sales. The reduced sales of our dialysis reuse products were significantly mitigated by increased sales in our dialysate concentrate during the past several years, which sales are anticipated to remain at similar levels during fiscal 2021. However, no assurance can be given that we will succeed at increasing sales in the near or long term. Fresenius, the largest dialysis chain in the U.S., manufactures dialysate concentrate itself and therefore provides dialysate concentrate to its own dialysis clinics. DaVita and certain international customers have also continued their reduction of dialysate concentrate purchases from us as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for such product. In addition, there is increased demand in the market for powdered dialysate products principally due to the lower costs associated with shipping such products. However, we do not manufacture powdered dialysate products.\nBecause a significant portion of our Life Sciences and Dental segment net sales comes from a few large customers, any significant decrease in sales to these customers, due to industry consolidation or otherwise, could harm our operating results. In our Life Sciences segment, two customers collectively accounted for 41.7% of our fiscal 2020 net sales for this segment. The loss of a significant amount of business from either of these two customers would have a material adverse effect on our Life Sciences segment. The distribution network in the U.S. dental industry is concentrated, with relatively few distributors of consumable products accounting for a significant share of the sales volume to dentists. Accordingly, net sales and profitability of our Dental segment are highly dependent on our relationships with a limited number of large distributors. During fiscal 2020, the top three customers of our Dental segment accounted for 42.0% of its net sales. The loss of a significant amount of business from any of these three customers would have a material adverse effect on our Dental segment. In addition, because our Dental segment products are primarily sold through third-party distributors and not directly to end users, we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that our distributors devote to our products. There can be no assurance that there will not be a loss or reduction in business from one or more of our major customers. In addition, we cannot assure that net sales from customers that have accounted for significant net sales in the past, either individually or as a group, will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period.\nOur industry is experiencing significant scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater regulation in the future. Our medical devices and our business activities are subject to rigorous regulation, including by the FDA, EPA, Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities and members of Congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. In addition, certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers. As a result, we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers licensed\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 12\nCantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nby certain states and to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals at the federal level. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could adversely impact our business. In addition, we may continue to devote substantial time and financial resources to further develop and implement policies, systems, and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, several of which may expose us to significant penalties or fines and may also impact our business. We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations. Moreover, as directed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), the SEC has implemented reporting and disclosure requirements related to the use of certain minerals, known as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (specifically, tantalum, tin, tungsten (or their ores), and gold) which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities, if appropriate. Although we have not historically had any issues, that could change if such materials are found to be used in our products. As of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2019 calendar year, although we fully complied with the regulation, we were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of our suppliers and were unable to determine that all of our products are conflict free. We may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future. We may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement.\nOur businesses are heavily reliant on certain raw materials and can be adversely impacted by rising prices and potential governmental changes to import and tariff policies. We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, components and other supplies essential to our operations from numerous suppliers in the U.S. and abroad. The principal raw materials that we use to conduct operations include chemicals, paper, resin, stainless steel and plastic components. From time to time we experience price increases for raw materials, with no guarantee that such increases can be passed along to our customers. In addition, although fuel and oil prices have been at relatively low levels, an increase in prices can also have a significant adverse impact on transportation costs related to both the purchasing and delivery of products and services. If costs materially increase in the future, we may not be able to implement price increases to our customers, which would adversely impact our gross margins. Our business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, additional workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed upon the importation of our products in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our cost of operations. Future quotas, duties or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe acquisition of new businesses and product lines, which has inherent risks, is an important part of our growth strategy. We intend to grow, in part, by acquiring new products and businesses and we are limited by our credit agreement as to the level of cash consideration we can deploy as part of such acquisitions. The success of this strategy depends upon several factors, including our ability to identify and acquire appropriate products and businesses, including obtaining required regulatory (such as antitrust) approvals, obtain financing for acquisitions on terms that are favorable or acceptable, integrate acquired operations, personnel, products, technologies and regulatory procedures into our organization effectively, retain and motivate key personnel and retain the customers and suppliers of acquired companies, realize expected benefits such as perceived tax benefits and synergies and successfully promote and increase sales and profits of acquired product lines. We also may not be able to sustain the rates of growth that we have experienced in the past, whether by acquiring businesses or otherwise. In addition, we often experience competition from third parties interested in the same acquisition candidate. This may result in increases in the price paid for acquisition candidates. In addition, assumptions regarding the growth of businesses we acquire may differ from actual results. Other risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions include delays in realizing the benefits of the transactions, including achievement of anticipated operating efficiencies and synergies and other transaction benefits as well as forecasted sales and earnings, diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, difficulties in implementing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies and risks associated with the assumption of contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquired companies.\nGiven the subjective nature of the assumptions used in the determination of fair value calculations, we may potentially have significant earnings volatility in our future results of operations. In addition, we have occasionally used our stock as partial\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 13\nCantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nconsideration for acquisitions, such as in the Hu-Friedy acquisition. Our common stock may not remain at a price at which it can be used as consideration for acquisitions without diluting our existing stockholders, and potential acquisition candidates may not view our stock attractively. We have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. If future operating results of the acquired businesses are significantly less than the results anticipated at the time of the acquisitions, we may be required to incur impairment charges.\nThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur international business subjects us to a number of risks and our limited operating experience and market recognition in new international markets may limit our international expansion strategy and cause our international return on investments and growth to suffer. Our international business subjects us to a number of risks and complications associated with manufacturing, sales, services and other operations outside of the U.S.. These include risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems, enhanced credit risks in certain European countries as well as emerging market regions, foreign customers with longer payment cycles than customers in the U.S., tax laws that could restrict our ability to use tax attributes, offset gains, or repatriate funds, and tariffs and exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country. Our future growth depends in part on our international expansion efforts, including efforts in emerging markets such as China. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in locations and environments unfamiliar to us. Additionally, global operations are subject to risks and uncertainties, including political and economic instability, general economic conditions, imposition of government controls, the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and U.S. export laws and trade restrictions. In connection with our expansion efforts we may encounter obstacles we did not face in North America, including cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor and market practices, difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments, foreign customers\u2019 requirements and preferences, and the difficulty of administering business overseas. Further, sales practices in certain international markets may be inconsistent with our desired business practices and U.S. and other legal requirements, which may impact our ability to expand as planned. We may also encounter difficulty expanding in new international markets because of competitors already entrenched in the market, and our limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products in these new international markets. Our failure to develop new markets or disappointing growth outside of existing markets may negatively affect our return on investments relating to our international expansion efforts. In addition, we may experience difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights or weaker intellectual property right protections in some countries.\nFurther, international markets are increasingly being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs, and certain international markets may also be impacted by foreign government efforts to understand healthcare practices and pricing in other countries, which could result in increased pricing transparency across geographies and pressure to harmonize reimbursement and ultimately reduce the selling prices of our products. Most international jurisdictions have regulatory approval and periodic renewal requirements for medical devices, and countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices may adopt such requirements. We must comply with these requirements in order to market our products in these jurisdictions. In addition, the trend in countries around the world toward more stringent regulatory requirements for product clearance, changing reimbursement models, and more rigorous inspection and enforcement activities has generally caused or may cause us and other medical device manufacturers to experience more uncertainty, delay, risk and expense, including the European Union\u2019s enactment of the Medical Devices Regulation. We expect that the international regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions, and thereby have a material impact on our business. Further, any significant changes in the competitive, political, legal, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) from the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d may adversely impact our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of our products in the EU, result in restrictions or imposition of taxes and duties for importing our product candidates into the EU, and may require us to incur additional expenses in order to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates in the EU. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the EU. Under the withdrawal agreement agreed between the U.K. and the EU, the U.K. will be subject to\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 14\nCantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\na transition period until December 31, 2020 (the \u201cTransition Period\u201d) during which EU rules will continue to apply. During the Transition Period, negotiations between the U.K. and the EU are expected to continue in relation to the future customs and trading relationship between the U.K. and the EU following the expiration of the Transition Period. Due to the current COVID-19 global pandemic, negotiations between the U.K. and the EU scheduled for March, April and May have either been postponed or occurring in a reduced forum via video conference. There is, therefore, an increased likelihood that the Transition Period may need to be extended beyond December 31, 2020 (although it remains the position of the U.K. government that it will not be extended). Since we have a significant presence in the U.K., these changes may adversely affect our operations, financial results and cash flows.\nHealth care policy changes on both the federal and state levels may have a material adverse effect on us. In response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. health care system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. We cannot predict with certainty what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the state level, or what the ultimate effect of federal healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on us or on our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions regarding our products and services.\nOur stock price and trading volume has been volatile from time to time and has experienced significant fluctuations over the past several months and years as a result of various market factors. We may experience continued fluctuations in price and volume in the future that could negatively impact the value of our outstanding shares. The market for our common stock has, from time to time, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may have been unrelated to our operating performance. In addition, the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry and other financial analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. We do not control these or any other analysts, nor do we control their respective reports. Our future operating results are subject to substantial uncertainty, and our stock price could decline significantly if we fail to meet or exceed analysts\u2019 forecasts and expectations. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, lower their price target or issue commentary or observations about us or our stock that are perceived by the market as negative, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. In addition, there are many other large, well-established, publicly traded companies active in our industry and market, which may cause our company to garner less attention from industry analysts. If these analysts decrease coverage or otherwise cease to cover our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nCompetition from lower cost manufacturing facilities such as those located in China, Southeast Asia and certain locations within North America could result in a reduction in our net sales of dental products due to reduced average selling prices or our customers no longer purchasing certain products from us. Despite expensive shipping costs, quality concerns, sustainability issues and other matters, some of our competitors manufacture certain dental products in lower cost locations such as China, Southeast Asia and certain locations within North America. Although we believe the quality of our dental products, which are generally produced in the U.S., are superior, our sales in the future may be adversely affected by either loss of sales or reductions in the prices of our products as a result of this lower cost competition. Price erosion resulting from lower cost competition did not have a material adverse impact on our business during fiscal 2020, but no assurance can be given that we will not face increased competition in the future.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, which may delay or prevent new product introduction and subject us to citations, fines and other regulatory actions. Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by governmental and private agencies in both the U.S. and in other countries where we do business. In the U.S., our products and services are regulated by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In many foreign countries, sales of our products are subject to extensive regulations that may or may not be comparable to those of the FDA. In Europe, our products are regulated primarily by country and community regulations of those countries within the European Economic Area and must conform to the requirements of those authorities. The regulatory agencies regulate the testing, manufacturing, recordkeeping, storage, packaging, labeling, marketing, distribution, reporting, safety and import and export of medical supplies and devices. Certain international regulatory bodies also impose import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. In general, unless an exemption applies, a medical device or product or service must receive regulatory approval or clearance before it can be marketed or sold. Delays in agency review can significantly delay new product introduction and may result in a product becoming \u201cdated\u201d or losing its market opportunity before it can be introduced. In addition, the FDA and other agency clearances generally are required before we can make significant modifications to existing products or market new claims or uses for existing products. The FDA also has the authority to require a recall or modification of products in the event of a defect or other issues. The process of obtaining\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 15\nCantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nmarketing clearances and approvals from regulatory agencies for new products (or modifications to, or additional claims or uses for, existing products) can be time consuming and expensive. There is no assurance that clearances or approvals will be granted or that agency review will not involve delays that would adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products. During the past several years, the FDA, in accordance with its standard practice, has conducted a number of inspections of our manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with regulatory standards relating to our testing, manufacturing, storage and packaging of products. On occasion, following an inspection, the FDA has called our attention to certain \u201cGood Manufacturing Practices\u201d compliance deficiencies. If we fail to meet QSRs or violate applicable FDA, EPA or other laws or regulations or if any of our medical devices are found to be ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, or if we fail to adequately correct violations or comply with requests by regulatory agencies, we could be subject to reports or warning letters, citations and fines as well as additional regulatory action including an order to recall, replace, repair, or refund non-compliant medical devices, which may have material reputational and financial impacts. Further, regulatory agencies could detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices. The regulatory agencies may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, including a hold on approving new devices until issues are resolved to its satisfaction, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The regulatory agencies may also recommend prosecution to the DOJ. Federal, state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes might have on our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that regulation of our products will not become more restrictive in the future and that any such development would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCompliance with international laws and regulations, import and export limitations, anti-corruption laws, and exchange controls may be difficult, burdensome and expensive. We are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making bribes or other improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We are also subject to limitations on trade with persons in sanctioned countries. Our growing exposure to international markets increase the inherent risks of encountering such issues. While our employees, distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws, no assurance can be given that our training and internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to severe fines and penalties material in scope.\nOur operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial results. In the ordinary course of certain of our manufacturing processes, we use various chemicals and other regulated substances. Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Although we are not aware of any material claims involving violation of environmental or occupational health and safety laws or regulations, there can be no assurance that such a claim may not arise in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. We can give no assurance that our environmental, health and safety compliance programs have been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. We cannot assure you that any liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not adversely affect our reputation or adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nHealthcare cost containment pressures and legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors or preferences for alternate therapies could decrease the demand for our products, the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices. Many of our products are purchased by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers that typically bill various third-party payors, including governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care programs, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for (or associated\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 16\nCantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nwith) their products and services from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies. The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and services. Even if we offer a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors for such product (or associated with its use). Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the U.S. and foreign countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCurrency fluctuations and trade barriers could adversely affect our results of operations. A portion of our products in all of our business segments are exported to and imported from a variety of geographic locations, and our business could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers, fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies, tariff increases and import and export restrictions, affecting all of such geographies including but not limited to the U.S., Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Asia. Changes in the value of the Euro, British Pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Singapore dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Sri Lankan Rupee and Japanese Yen against the U.S. dollar affect our results of operations because certain cash bank accounts, accounts receivable and liabilities of Cantel and its subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in U.S. dollars, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Singapore dollars, Chinese Renminbi, Sri Lanka Rupees, or Japanese Yen, but must be converted into each entity\u2019s functional currency. Furthermore, the financial statements of subsidiaries in the EU, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, China, Sri Lanka and Japan are translated using the accounting policies described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, and therefore are impacted by changes in the Euro, British Pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Sri Lankan Rupee and Japanese Yen exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims resulting from the use of products we sell and distribute. Our sales and distribution of products may expose us to product liability claims. We maintain product liability insurance, which we believe is adequate for our businesses. However, there can be no assurance that insurance coverage for these risks will continue to be available or, if available, that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present level of coverage will continue to be available at a reasonable cost. A partially or completely uninsured successful claim against us could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may not have insurance covering claims of emotional harm or mental distress related to our products or services when not associated with physical injury. This could result in our incurring significant uninsured damages.\nWe rely on intellectual property and proprietary rights to maintain our competitive position. We rely on proprietary technology that we protect primarily through licensing arrangements, patents, trade secrets and proprietary know-how. There can be no assurance that any pending or future patent applications will be granted or that any current or future patents, regardless of whether we are an owner or a licensee of the patent, will not be challenged, rendered unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights will provide a competitive advantage to us. There can also be no assurance that our trade secrets or non-disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of our proprietary information. There can also be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us or that our technology will not infringe upon patents or other rights owned by others.\nBreaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations and install certain software systems on our customers' networks. Our information technology systems have been subjected to computer viruses, or other malicious codes, and cyber or phishing attacks. Although past attacks did not have a significant adverse impact on our business, these types of attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being lost or stolen, disruption of our operations, or other negative consequences, such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs, diversion of management attention and adverse impact on our relationships with vendors and customers. Such attacks could also impact our customers' networks. Cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. While we have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 17\nCantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nas litigation and regulatory action. There can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a significant impact on our business.\nIf we are unable to retain key personnel, our business could be adversely affected. Our success is dependent to a significant degree upon the efforts of key members of our management. Although none of our key executives has an employment agreement with the Company, each key executive is covered by the Company\u2019s Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan. In addition, we have short and long term incentive plans for our key executives that are designed in part to have a retentive effect on the executives. However, there can be no assurance that the terms of the severance agreements or incentive plans will have such an effect. We believe the loss or unavailability of any such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical, sales, marketing and other personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development and operation of our businesses.\nSome of our facilities are located near coastal zones, and the occurrence of a hurricane or other natural disasters could damage our facilities and equipment, which could harm our operations. Some of our facilities are vulnerable to damage from hurricanes and from other types of disasters, including fire, floods, power loss, communications failures, terrorism and similar events since any insurance we may maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be seriously, or potentially completely, impaired.\nThe accounting method for our convertible debt that may be settled in cash could have a material effect on our reported financial results. Accounting standards require us to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments, such as our convertible debt, that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion, in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The accounting for our convertible debt requires an equity component of the convertible debt to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date, and that the value of the equity component be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of our convertible debt. As a result, we will record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the debt discount over the applicable term of the convertible debt. We will report larger net losses, or lower net income, in our financial results as these results will include both the non-cash amortization of the debt discount and the cash interest on the notional value of the debt, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results and the trading price of our common stock. In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments, such as our convertible debt, that may be settled entirely or partly in cash, may be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible debt are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, except to the extent that the conversion value of the convertible debt exceeds the principal amount. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, \u201c(Subtopic 470-20): Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options\u201d (\u201cASU 2020-06\u201d), which will require us to use the \u201cif-converted\u201d method when calculating diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments. As the treasury stock method will no longer be permitted beginning in our fiscal year 2022, our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our convertible debt if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In the event the conditional conversion feature of our convertible debt is triggered, holders of the debt will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of the notes do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the notes or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change, and our debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes. If a fundamental change occurs at any time prior to the maturity date, subject to certain conditions, holders will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, upon conversion of the notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the notes surrendered therefor or settle the notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the notes at a time when a repurchase is required by the indenture governing the notes\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 18\nCantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nor to pay any cash payable upon future conversions of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture and could also lead to a default under our credit agreement. A default under the indenture governing the notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other existing or future indebtedness, including our credit agreement. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nOur level of debt may adversely impact our liquidity, restrict our operations and ability to respond to business opportunities, and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions. As of July 31, 2020, our total indebtedness was $1,113,375 in aggregate principal, which includes the principal portion of our convertible debt. Our level of debt could have significant consequences which include, but are not limited to, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes, requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, imposing financial and other restrictive covenants on our operations, including limiting our ability to (i) declare or pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, (ii) purchase assets, make investments and complete acquisitions, and (iii) dispose of assets, and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures or take advantage of new opportunities to grow our business. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations, comply with our debt covenants and deleverage depends on our cash flows and financial performance, which are affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. The rate at which we will be able to or choose to deleverage is uncertain. Failure to meet our debt service obligations or comply with our debt covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. We may be unable to cure, or obtain a waiver of, an event of default or otherwise amend our debt agreements to prevent an event of default thereunder on terms acceptable to us or at all. In that event, the debt holders could accelerate the related debt, which may result in the cross-acceleration or cross-default of other debt, leases or other obligations. We may not have sufficient funds available to repay accelerated indebtedness, and we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices, incur additional indebtedness or issue common stock or other equity securities, which we may be unable to do on terms acceptable to us, in amounts sufficient to meet our needs or at all. Our inability to service our debt obligations or refinance our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness, the holder of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. Refinancing our indebtedness may also require us to expense previous debt issuance costs or to incur new debt issuance costs.\nWe may not be successful in executing our \u201cCantel 2.0\u201d commercial initiatives. In 2020, we announced a new set of initiatives titled \u201cCantel 2.0\u201d representing key strategic priorities for the next several years. Among these commercial priorities are a new focus on sales into ASCs, enhanced focus on driving the adoption of the \u201cComplete Circle of Protection\u201d portfolio for large hospital systems and the expanded penetration of our procedure products into Europe. Our ability to successfully execute on these key strategic initiatives is uncertain given the competitive dynamics in each of our markets. In particular, we are dedicating significant new commercial resources to our ASC strategy, and the customer receptivity to our offering may not be successful.", "PERMNO": 22825, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CMD"}
