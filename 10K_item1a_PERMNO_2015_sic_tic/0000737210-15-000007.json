{"cik": "737210", "company": "LNB BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nAs a competitor in the banking and financial services industries, the Corporation and its business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Corporation's other filings with the SEC, before making any investment decision with respect to the Corporation's securities. In particular, you should consider the discussion contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which contains Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones the Corporation faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known by the Corporation or that the Corporation currently deems immaterial may also affect the Corporation's business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Corporation's business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could change. Under those circumstances, the trading prices of the Corporation's securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nEconomic trends have adversely affected the Corporation's industry and business and may continue to do so.\nDifficult economic conditions over the last several years led to dramatic declines in the housing market that resulted in decreased home prices and increased delinquencies and foreclosures which negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant write-downs of assets by many financial institutions. In addition, the values of real estate collateral supporting many loans declined and may not recover. These general economic trends, the reduced availability of commercial credit and relatively high rates of unemployment all negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit and resulted in significant write-downs. Concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other. This market uncertainty and tightening of credit has led to increased commercial and consumer deficiencies, lack of customer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and the lack of confidence in the financial markets adversely affected the Corporation's business, financial condition, results of operations and share price and, while the Corporation\u2019s business has recovered to some extent, these economic and business conditions may still adversely affect us. Also, the Corporation's ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the probable incurred losses in its credit exposure is made more complex by these difficult market and economic conditions. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions has been slow to recover and local governments and many companies continue to be adversely affected by a relative lack of consumer spending and liquidity in the credit markets. Any worsening of current conditions would have an adverse effect on the Corporation, its customers and the other financial institutions in its market. As a result, the Corporation may experience increases in foreclosures, delinquencies and customer bankruptcies.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the Corporation's earnings and financial condition.\nThe Corporation's earnings and cash flows depend substantially upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earnings assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond\nthe Corporation's control, including general economic conditions, competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Corporation receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect: (1) the Corporation's ability to originate loans and obtain deposits; (2) the fair value of the Corporation's financial assets and liabilities, including its securities portfolio; and (3) the average duration of the Corporation's interest-earning assets. This also includes the risk that interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), the risk that the individual interest rates or rates indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk), including a prolonged flat or inverted yield curve environment. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation's allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual future losses.\nThe Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable and incurred loan losses. Every loan the Corporation makes carries a certain risk of non-repayment, and the Corporation makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. Through a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio, Management determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses by considering general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio, the collateral supporting the loans and performance of customers relative to their financial obligations with the Corporation. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond the Corporation's control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. The Corporation cannot fully predict the amount or timing of losses or whether the loss allowance will be adequate in the future. If the Corporation's assumptions prove to be incorrect, its allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in its loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Excessive loan losses and significant additions to the Corporation's allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, as required by these regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in economic and political conditions could adversely affect the Corporation's earnings.\nThe Corporation's success depends, to a certain extent, upon economic and political conditions, local and national, as well as governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, money supply and other factors beyond the Corporation's control may adversely affect its asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore, its earnings. Because the Corporation has a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and the Corporation's ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of the Corporation's borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on the Corporation's earnings. If during a period of reduced real estate values the Corporation is required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt or to increase its allowance for loan losses, it could materially reduce the Corporation's profitability and adversely affect its financial condition. The substantial majority of the Corporation's loans are to individuals and businesses in Ohio. Consequently, significant declines in the economy in Ohio could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, future earnings are susceptible to declining credit conditions in the markets in which the Corporation operates.\nCertain industries, including the financial services industry, are disproportionately affected by certain economic indicators such as unemployment and real estate asset values. Should the improvement of these economic indicators lag the improvement of the overall economy, the Corporation could be adversely affected.\nShould the stabilization of the U.S. economy continue, and lead to a further general economic recovery, the improvement of certain economic indicators, such as unemployment and real estate asset values and rents, may nevertheless continue to lag behind the overall economy. These economic indicators typically affect certain industries, such as real estate and financial services, more significantly. Furthermore, financial services companies with a substantial lending business are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans. Should unemployment or real estate asset values fail to recover for an extended period of time, the Corporation's results of operations could be negatively affected.\nStrong competition may reduce the Corporation's ability to generate loans and deposits in its market.\nThe Corporation competes in a consolidating industry. A large part of the Corporation's competition continues to be large regional companies which have the capital resources to substantially impact such things as loan and deposit pricing, delivery channels and products. This may allow those companies to offer what may be perceived in the market as better pricing, better products and better convenience relative to smaller competitors like the Corporation, which could impact the Corporation's ability to grow its assets and earnings.\nThe Corporation's earnings and reputation may be adversely affected if credit risk is not properly managed.\nOriginating and underwriting loans is critical to the success of the Corporation. This activity exposes the Corporation to credit risk, which is the risk of losing principal and interest income because the borrower cannot repay the loan in full. The Corporation depends on collateral in underwriting loans, and the value of this collateral is impacted by interest rates and economic conditions.\nThe Corporation's earnings may be adversely affected if Management does not understand and properly manage loan concentrations. The Corporation's commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial real estate. This includes significant commercial and residential development customers. This means that the Corporation's credit risk profile is dependent upon, not only the general economic conditions in the market, but also the health of the local real estate market. Certain of these loans are not fully amortized over the loan period, but have a balloon payment due at maturity. The borrower's ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to refinance the loan or to sell the underlying collateral. This factor, combined with others, including the Corporation's geographic concentration, can lead to unexpected credit deterioration and higher provisions for loan losses.\nThe Corporation is subject to liquidity risk.\nMarket conditions or other events could negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting the Corporation's ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Although Management has implemented strategies to maintain sufficient sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions, any substantial, unexpected and/or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could adversely affect the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and international accords, financial institutions are subject to new and increased capital and liquidity requirements. In light of these new requirements, it is possible that the Corporation could be required to increase its capital levels in the future above the levels in its current financial plans. These new requirements could have a negative impact on the Corporation's ability to lend, or grow deposit balances and on its ability to make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases. Higher capital levels could also lower the Corporation's return on equity.\nLegislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, could adversely impact the Corporation or the businesses in which it is engaged.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. The Corporation is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance funds, and not to benefit the Corporation's shareholders. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact the Corporation or its ability to increase the value of its business.\nThe US government has undertaken major reform of the financial services industry, including new efforts to protect consumers and investors from financial abuse. The Corporation expects to face further increased regulation of its industry as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide economic stimulus, financial market stability and enhanced regulation of financial services companies and to enhance the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions and markets. The Corporation also expects in many cases more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution's allowance for loan losses. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against the Corporation could require it to devote significant time and resources to defending its business and may lead to penalties that materially affect the Corporation and its shareholders.\nIn July 2013, final rules were released regarding implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital rules for U.S. banking organizations. The rules substantially increased the complexity of capital calculations and the amount of required capital to be maintained. Specifically, the rules reduced the items that count as capital, established higher capital ratios for all banks and increased risk weighting of a number of asset classes a bank holds. The potential impact of these rules includes, but is not limited to, reduced\nlending and negative pressure on profitability and return on equity due to the higher capital requirements. The cost of implementation and ongoing compliance with these rules may also negatively impact operating costs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act may adversely affect the Corporation's business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, imposes significant restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. Because the Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of regulations with significant discretion, the effects of the Act on the Corporation's business will depend largely on the implementation of the Act by those agencies, and many of the details of the law have been only recently implemented, or remain in the process of being implemented and the effects they will have on the Corporation are difficult to predict.\nMany of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act apply directly only to institutions much larger than the Corporation, and some will affect only institutions that engage in activities in which the Corporation does not engage. Among the changes to occur pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that can be expected to have an effect on the Corporation are the following:\n\u2022\nThe OTS has been merged into the OCC and the authority of the other remaining bank regulatory agencies restructured;\n\u2022\nAn independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been established within the Federal Reserve Board, empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws;\n\u2022\nNew trust preferred securities will no longer count toward Tier 1 capital;\n\u2022\nThe standard maximum amount of deposit insurance per customer is permanently increased to $250,000;\n\u2022\nThe deposit insurance assessment base calculation has been expanded to equal a depository institution's total assets minus the sum of its average tangible equity during the assessment period;\n\u2022\nCorporate governance requirements applicable generally to all public companies in all industries have required or will require new compensation practices, including, but not limited to, requiring companies to \u201cclaw back\u201d incentive compensation under certain circumstances, to provide shareholders the opportunity to cast a non-binding vote on executive compensation, to consider the independence of compensation advisors and new executive compensation disclosure requirements;\n\u2022\nEstablish new rules and restrictions regarding the origination of mortgages;\n\u2022\nPermit the Federal Reserve to prescribe regulations regarding interchange transaction fees, and limit them to an amount reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction in question.\nMany provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to implementation and will require interpretation and rule making by federal regulators. The Corporation is closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure continued compliance with laws and regulations. While the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Corporation cannot be determined yet, the law is likely to result in increased compliance costs and fees paid to regulators, along with possible restrictions on the Corporation's operations.\nThe Corporation may be adversely impacted by weakness in the local economies it serves.\nThe Corporation's business activities are geographically concentrated in Northeast Ohio and, in particular, Lorain County, Ohio, where commercial activity previously deteriorated at a greater rate than in other parts of Ohio and in the national economy. The Corporation is less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. This has led to and may lead to further unexpected deterioration in loan quality, slower asset and deposit growth, which may adversely affect the Corporation's operating results. Moreover, the Corporation cannot give any further assurance that it will benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions in its primary market areas if they do occur.\nFuture FDIC premiums could be substantially higher and would have an unfavorable effect on earnings.\nHigher levels of bank failures over the last few years have dramatically increased resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the deposit insurance fund. In addition, the FDIC now insures deposit accounts up to $250,000 per customer (up from $100,000). These programs have placed additional stress on the deposit insurance fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC has increased assessment rates of insured institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes additional assessments and costs with respect to deposits, requiring the FDIC to impose deposit insurance\nassessments based on total assets rather than total deposits. These announced increases, legislative and regulatory changes and any future increases or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely impact the Corporation's earnings and financial condition. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, or the cost of resolving prior failures exceeds expectations, the Corporation may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Corporation has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by the Corporation or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Corporation to credit risk in the event of default of the Corporation's counterparty or client. In addition, the Corporation's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due the Corporation. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect the Corporation's results of operations.\nA failure of the Corporation's operating systems or infrastructure, or those of its third-party vendors, could disrupt its business.\nThe Corporation's business is dependent on its ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal and regulatory standards and the Corporation's product specifications, which it changes to reflect its business needs. As processing demands change and the Corporation's loan portfolios grow in both volume and differing terms and conditions, developing and maintaining the Corporation's operating systems and infrastructure becomes increasingly challenging and there is no assurance that the Corporation can adequately or efficiently develop and maintain such systems. The Corporation's loan originations and conversions and the servicing, financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities that support them may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are beyond the Corporation's control, adversely affecting its ability to process these transactions. Any such failure could adversely affect the Corporation's ability to service its customers, result in financial loss or liability to its customers, disrupt its business, and result in regulatory action or cause reputational damage. Despite the plans and facilities the Corporation has in place, its ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, internet, transportation or other services used by the Corporation or third parties with which it conducts business. Notwithstanding the Corporation's efforts to maintain business continuity, a disruptive event impacting its processing locations could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation's operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal, confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. Although the Corporation takes protective measures, its computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, malicious attacks and other events that could have a security impact beyond the Corporation's control. If one or more of such events occur, personal, confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, the Corporation's computer systems and networks, could be jeopardized or otherwise interruptions or malfunctions in its operations could result in significant losses or reputational damage. The Corporation also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential and proprietary information, some through third parties. The Corporation has put in place secure transmission capability, and works to ensure third parties follow similar procedures. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. In the event personal, confidential or other information is jeopardized, intercepted, misused or mishandled, the Corporation may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and it may be subject to fines, penalties, litigation costs and settlements and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by it. If one or more of such events occur, the Corporation's business, financial condition or results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected.\nThe Corporation is subject to risk from the failure of third party vendors.\nThe Corporation relies on other companies to provide components of the Corporation's business infrastructure. Third party vendors provide certain components of the Corporation's business infrastructure, such as the Bank's processing and electronic banking systems, item processing and Internet connections. While the Corporation has selected these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties not providing the Corporation their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect the Corporation's ability to deliver products and services to the Corporation's operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of the Corporation's websites, which could adversely affect the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation is subject to losses due to the errors or fraudulent behavior of employees or third parties.\nThe Corporation is exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical recordkeeping errors and transactional errors. The Corporation\u2019s business is dependent on its employees as well as third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. The Corporation could be materially adversely affected if one of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Corporation\u2019s operations or systems. When the Corporation originates loans, it relies upon information supplied by loan applicants and third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal and title information, if applicable, and employment and income documentation provided by third parties. If any of this information is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the Corporation generally bears the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of the Corporation to operate its business, potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could negatively impact the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe potential for fraud in the card payment industry is significant.\nIssuers of prepaid and credit cards have suffered significant losses in recent years with respect to the theft of cardholder data that has been illegally exploited for personal gain. The theft of such information is regularly reported and affects not only individuals but businesses as well (albeit to a lesser degree). Many types of credit card fraud exist, including the counterfeiting of cards and \u201cskimming.\u201d \u201cSkimming\u201d is the term for a specialized type of credit card information theft whereby, typically, an employee of a merchant will copy the cardholder\u2019s number and security code (either by handwriting the information onto a piece of paper, entering such information into a keypad or other device, or using a handheld device which \u201creads\u201d and then stores the card information embedded in the magnetic strip). Once a credit card number and security code has been skimmed, the skimmer can use such information for purchases until the unauthorized use is detected either by the cardholder or the card issuer. Losses from fraud have been substantial for certain card industry participants. Although fraud has not had a material impact on the profitability of the Bank, it is possible that such activity could impact the Corporation at some time in the future.\nThe Corporation may have fewer resources than many of its competitors to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Corporation's future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in its operations. Many of the Corporation's competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Corporation may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact the Corporation's financial statements.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Corporation's financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Corporation records and reports it financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nThe Corporation's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which the Corporation is engaged can be intense, and the Corporation may not be able to retain or hire the people it wants and/or needs. In order to attract and retain qualified employees, the Corporation must compensate its employees at market levels. If the Corporation is unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, the Corporation's performance, including its competitive position, could suffer, and, in turn, adversely affect the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation's ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations.\nHolders of the Corporation's common shares are only entitled to receive such dividends as the Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Furthermore, the Corporation's common shareholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of holders of its preferred stock, to the extent any preferred stock is issued and outstanding, and any increase in the dividend is subject to Board approval and dependent upon numerous considerations relating to the capital position and needs of the corporation.\nIn September 2009, the Corporation reduced its quarterly dividend on its common shares to $0.01 per share. The Corporation could determine to eliminate its common shares dividend altogether. This could adversely affect the market price of the Corporation's\ncommon shares. Also, the Corporation is a bank holding company and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends.\nIn addition, the terms of the Corporation's outstanding trust preferred securities prohibit it from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on its capital stock, including its common shares, if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the applicable indenture or if the Corporation has given notice of its election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing.\nFurther, the Merger Agreement between the Corporation and Northwest contains certain restrictions related to the Corporation\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends. See \u201cMarket Information; Equity Holders; Dividends\u201d contained in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAdditional capital may not be available to the Corporation if and when it is needed.\nThe Corporation and the Bank are subject to capital-based regulatory requirements. The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to meet capital requirements is dependent upon a number of factors, including results of operations, level of nonperforming assets, interest rate risk, future economic conditions, future changes in regulatory and accounting policies and capital requirements, and the ability to raise additional capital if and when it is needed. Certain circumstances, such as a reduction of capital due to losses from nonperforming assets or otherwise, could cause the Corporation or the Bank to become unable to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements, which may materially and adversely affect the Corporation's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. In such an event, additional capital may be required to meet requirements. The Corporation's ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside its control, and on the Corporation's financial performance. Accordingly, additional capital, if needed, may not be available on terms acceptable to the Corporation. Furthermore, if any such additional capital is raised through the offering of equity securities, it may dilute the holdings of the Corporation's existing shareholders or reduce the market price of the Corporation's common shares, or both.\nThe Corporation's risk management framework may not effectively identify or mitigate its risks.\nThe Corporation's risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. The Corporation has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and report the types of risk to which it is subject, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and strategic risk. The Corporation seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures and reporting requirements. Management of the Corporation's risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models that the Corporation uses to mitigate these risks are inadequate, the Corporation may incur increased losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that the Corporation has not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If the Corporation's risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate its risks, it could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nIf the Corporation is required to write down goodwill recorded in connection with its acquisitions, the Corporation's profitability would be negatively impacted.\nApplicable accounting standards require the Corporation to use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations. Under purchase accounting, if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of the acquired company's net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer's balance sheet as goodwill. At December 31, 2014, the Corporation had approximately $21.6 million of goodwill on its balance sheet. Goodwill must be evaluated for impairment at least annually. Write downs of the amount of any impairment, if necessary, are to be charged to the results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs. There can be no assurance that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in findings of impairment and related write downs, which would have an adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Corporation\u2019s Pending Merger with Northwest Bancshares, Inc.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met.\nBefore the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement may be completed, various approvals must be obtained from the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and state regulators. These governmental entities may impose conditions on the completion of the Merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Although Northwest Bancshares and the Corporation do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement or imposing additional costs on or limiting Northwest Bancshares's revenues, any of which might have a material adverse effect\non Northwest Bancshares following the Merger. There can be no assurance as to whether the regulatory approvals will be received, the timing of those approvals, or whether any conditions will be imposed.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed, which could have a negative impact on the Corporation.\nThe Merger Agreement with Northwest Bancshares is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to close. Those conditions include: approval by the Corporation\u2019s shareholders, regulatory approvals, the continued accuracy of certain representations and warranties by both parties and the performance by both parties of certain covenants and agreements.\nIn addition, certain circumstances exist where the Corporation may choose to terminate the Merger Agreement, including the acceptance of a superior proposal. There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing the Merger will be fulfilled or that the Merger will be completed.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences to the Corporation, including:\n\u2022\nthe Corporation's business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe Corporation may have incurred substantial expenses in connection with the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock might decline to the extent that its market price following announcement of the Merger reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Corporation's board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, under certain circumstances the Corporation may be required to pay Northwest Bancshares a $7,300,000 termination fee. The Corporation\u2019s shareholders cannot be certain that the Corporation would be able to find a party willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than the price Northwest Bancshares has agreed to pay in the Merger.\nNorthwest Bancshares may be unable to successfully integrate the Corporation's operations and retain the Corporation's employees.\nThe Corporation will be merged with and into Northwest Bancshares immediately following the closing of the Merger. The difficulties of merging the operations of the Corporation with Northwest Bancshares include:\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds;\n\u2022\ncombining different corporate cultures; and\n\u2022\nretaining key employees.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of Northwest Bancshares or the Corporation, and the loss of key personnel. The integration of the Corporation with Northwest Bancshares will require the experience and expertise of certain key employees of the Corporation who are expected to be retained by Northwest Bancshares. However, there can be no assurance that Northwest Bancshares will be successful in retaining these employees for the time period necessary to successfully integrate the Corporation into Northwest Bancshares. The diversion of management's attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the Merger and integration of the Corporation into Northwest Bancshares could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operation of Northwest Bancshares.\nEach party is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed merger is pending, which could adversely affect each party's business and operations.\nIn connection with the pendency of the Merger, it is possible that some customers and other persons with whom Northwest or the Corporation has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might seek to terminate, change, or renegotiate their relationships with Northwest or the Corporation, as in the case may be, as a result of the Merger, which could negatively affect Northwest's or the Corporation's respective revenues, earnings, and cash flows, as well as the market price of Northwest's or the Corporation's common stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Corporation is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the Merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the\nability in certain cases to enter into or amend contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures. Such limitations could negatively affect the Corporation's businesses and operations prior to the completion of the Merger.\nLitigation may be filed against the Corporation and its board of directors that could prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger or result in the payment of damages following completion of the Merger.\nIn connection with the Merger, it is possible that the Corporation's shareholders may file putative shareholder class action lawsuits against the Corporation and its board of directors. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs may seek to enjoin the Merger. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain. If a dismissal is not granted or a settlement is not reached, such potential lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to the Corporation, including any costs associated with indemnification. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Merger is consummated may adversely affect the combined company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and market price.", "PERMNO": 87652, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "LNBB"}
