{"cik": "1158895", "company": "LEMAITRE VASCULAR INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Report and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. The following important factors, among others, could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this Report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also significantly impair our business operations. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results.\nFluctuations in our quarterly and annual financial results have resulted and will continue to result from numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for the products and services we sell;\n\u2022\nthe acceleration or deceleration of growth rates of our products;\n\u2022\nincreased product and price competition, due to market conditions, the regulatory landscape or other factors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of products and services we sell;\n\u2022\nour pricing strategy with respect to different product lines and services;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us, such as acquisitions of businesses or products or divestitures or discontinuations of products;\n\u2022\neffects of domestic and foreign economic and political conditions and exchange rates on our industry and/or customers;\n\u2022\nthe relocation and integration of manufacturing or processing operations and other strategic restructuring;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions that may necessitate recalls of our products or warning letters that negatively affect the markets for our products;\n\u2022\nchanges to the regulatory status of our products, including the lapse, suspension or cancellation of licenses or CE marking;\n\u2022\nthe payment or cessation of quarterly cash dividends, and/or the amount and frequency at which to increase them;\n\u2022\ncosts incurred by us to terminate contractual and other relationships, including those of distributors/agents;\n\u2022\nour ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable in selected countries outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business;\n\u2022\nthe expiration, elimination or utilization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry-forwards;\n\u2022\nmarket reception of our new or improved product and service offerings; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of any significant customer, especially in regard to any product or service that has a limited customer base.\nThese factors, some of which are not within our control, may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly. We believe the quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not always meaningful and should not be relied upon as the sole indicator of our future performance.\nIf we are unable to expand our product and service offerings, we may not achieve our growth objectives and our results of operations could suffer.\nTreatment of peripheral vascular and cardiovascular disease includes both open vascular surgery and minimally invasive endovascular procedures, and most of our products are used primarily or exclusively in open surgery procedures. We market and sell our products primarily to vascular surgeons. We estimate that in 2021 over 90% of our sales were from devices used in open surgery.\nA core component of our growth strategy is the acquisition of complementary product lines, principally in the open vascular surgery space. The number of appropriately sized targets in the open vascular surgery space is limited, and if we are unable to execute on our acquisition strategy (or we do not expand the scope of our acquisition strategy), growth of our sales may be inhibited.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively unless we can keep pace with existing or new products, services and technologies in the vascular device market and the minimally invasive endovascular procedure segment, in particular. Our success in developing and commercializing new products and new versions of our existing products and services, or acquiring new products, is affected by our ability to:\n\u2022\nrecognize in a timely manner new market trends and customer needs;\n\u2022\nidentify products or services that address those trends or needs;\n\u2022\nidentify suitable acquisition targets in the open vascular surgery space and execute on the acquisition of such targets;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory clearance or approval of new products and technologies;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully develop cost-effective manufacturing processes for such products;\n\u2022\ncommercially introduce such products, services and technologies; and\n\u2022\nachieve market acceptance.\nIf we are unable to expand our product or service offerings, whether through internal development or by acquisition, we may not achieve our growth objectives and our results of operations as well as our stock price could suffer.\nWe may not maintain our recent levels of profitability.\nThere can be no assurance we will continue to achieve net sales growth and/or profit growth in the future. In 2020 we undertook substantial cost reductions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have since reversed those reductions. Our operating expenses in 2021 were 16% higher than our operating expenses in 2020. If we are unable to effectively manage our operating expenses due to, for example, additional CE mark expenses, or increased headcount, we may need to implement cost-cutting again in order to maintain or improve our profitability. Decreased investment levels may inhibit future growth in net sales and earnings.\nAdditionally, our ability to maintain and increase profitability will be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level and timing of future sales, manufacturing costs and operating expenses;\n\u2022\nour ability to restrain or reduce operating expenses through cost-cutting measures;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our new products and services;\n\u2022\nthe productivity of our direct sales force and distributors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully build direct sales organizations in new markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully acquire and develop competitive products;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, products, services or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe impact on our business of competing products, technologies, and procedures;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products in new and existing markets;\n\u2022\nthe reimbursement rates for the medical procedures in which our products are used;\n\u2022\nthe cost of litigation, if any; and\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws.\nIf we do not comply with international regulatory requirements to market our products outside the United States or are required to modify our operations or products as a result of such requirements, our business will be harmed.\nSales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. These requirements and the amount of time required for approval may differ from our experiences with the U.S. FDA. In some countries, we rely on our international distributors to obtain premarket approvals, complete product registrations, comply with clinical trial requirements, and complete those steps that are customarily taken in the applicable jurisdictions to comply with governmental and quasi-governmental regulation. In the future, we expect to continue to rely on distributors in this manner in those countries where we continue to market and sell our products through them. Failure to satisfy these foreign regulations would impact our ability to sell our products in these countries and could cause our business to suffer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain the required regulatory approvals in these countries.\nOur products are currently regulated in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom under the European Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EC as amended by 2007/47/EC) (MDD) and the European Medical Device Regulation (2017/745) (MDR). In order to market our medical devices in the EU, we are required to obtain CE marks, which denote conformity to the essential requirements of the MDD or MDR, and manufacturers of higher-risk devices generally must use a \u201cNotified Body\u201d-an appointed independent third party to assess conformity. We currently use three Notified Bodies for our various products. We have received CE marks under the MDD to sell most of our products after managing a reinstatement process for those CE marks in 2020 and 2021.\nIn April 2017, the EU adopted new regulations for medical devices, the MDR, which replace the MDD and which took effect as of May 26, 2021. Our products will eventually be fully subject to the MDR, which requires all of our products, regardless of classification, to obtain a new CE mark in accordance with the new, more stringent standards under the MDR. As a condition to CE mark approval, clinical evidence will be required for Class III and implantable devices. As our Notified Bodies transition from MDD to MDR, they have begun to impose more rigorous requirements on us. Until recently, our preparation of filings under the MDR had been delayed due to our work on the MDD CE mark matters described above. If we fail to obtain new CE marks on these products or our other products under the MDR in a timely manner, or at all, future sales of our products in the EU could be adversely impacted.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain MDR CE marks for our existing products, and obtaining CE marks may involve a significant amount of time and expense, stringent clinical and preclinical testing, or modification of our products and could result in limitations being placed on the use of our products in order to obtain approval. These types of more stringent restrictions on our products as they transition to MDR could impact sales of our products and/or their gross margins could be adversely impacted. For example, under the CE mark issued for XenoSure in 2021 under the MDD, the indications for its use no longer include neuro or cardiac applications, indications for which the product was previously approved. We estimate that the removed indications may cause a loss of roughly $1.0 million of annual sales. Additionally, only XenoSure made from bovine pericardium sourced from certain of our suppliers is permitted to be sold under the new CE mark, which was a condition of its issuance. While our existing suppliers are meeting our demand for tissue supply, there can be no assurance that they will meet or sustain higher levels of demand in the future. If they cannot meet our demand for tissue supply, our ability to supply conforming XenoSure devices may be impacted and our sales may suffer. Additionally, the tissue from the two approved tissue suppliers is significantly more expensive than that sourced from the third supplier. As a result, our gross margin for XenoSure tissue sold in Europe has been impacted. The Company is pursuing a path to reinstate the third supplier, although no assurances can be given. Additionally, significant changes to our devices may trigger a requirement to file for an MDR CE mark earlier than expected, which could result in supply chain delays. For example, in March, 2020, we learned that a chemical used in our latex formulation was obsoleted. As a result, we must submit our new latex formulation to one of our Notified Bodies for review and acceptance under our shunt MDD CE mark, which we expect to do in Q1 2022. If the Notified Body determines that the change is significant under the rules of the MDD, it will require us to file a new MDR CE mark application, which could result in significant delays to instituting the change and thus maintaining adequate inventory levels of our shunts.\nFailure to receive or maintain CE mark approval would prohibit us from selling these products in the EU or the U.K., and would require significant delays in obtaining individual country approvals. If we do not receive or maintain these approvals, our business could be harmed. Maintaining a CE mark is contingent upon our continued compliance with applicable European medical device requirements, including limitations on advertising and promotion of medical devices and requirements governing the handling of adverse events. As highlighted above, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, retaining or maintaining the CE mark for any of our current products. In particular, adverse event reporting requirements in the EU and the U.K. mandate that we report incidents which led or could have led to death or serious deterioration in health. Under certain circumstances, we could be required to or could voluntarily initiate a recall or removal of our product from the market in order to address product deficiencies or malfunctions. Any recall of our products may harm our reputation with customers and divert managerial and financial resources.\nAs a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (\u201cMHRA\u201d) has announced that CE marking will continue to be recognized in the U.K. and certificates issued by EU-recognized Notified Bodies will continue to be valid in the U.K. market until June 30, 2023. Following such date, all devices marketed in the U.K. will require U.K. Conformity Assessed (\u201cUKCA\u201d) Marks certified by a U.K. Approved Body. If we fail to obtain UKCA marks by this June 30, 2023 deadline, or at all, our sales in the U.K. could be negatively affected.\nOur facilities are subject to periodic inspection by numerous regulatory authorities, including governmental agencies and Notified Bodies, and we must demonstrate compliance with the applicable medical devices regulations. Any failure by us to comply with regulatory requirements may entail our taking corrective action, such as modification of our policies and procedures. In addition, we may be required to cease all or part of our operations for some period of time until we can demonstrate that appropriate steps have been taken. There can be no assurance that we will be found in compliance with such standards in future audits.\nWe also pursue registrations in other jurisdictions in which we sell our devices directly, such as Japan and China. In 2015, the China Food and Drug Administration (NMPA) significantly increased the application fees for product registrations and imposed additional requirements for obtaining product approval, which includes requirements for conducting clinical trials to support the registration application process on newly introduced products in China. As a result, we may not seek registration for certain products where the cost is not justified. Any delay in product registrations could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic outbreak has caused disruptions in our business that are expected to continue for an indefinite period of time.\nLike many companies, we have experienced negative effects on our revenues and operations as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The wide geographic spread of the pandemic has adversely affected the global economy and has resulted in fluctuating and unpredictable demand for our products, many of which are used in elective surgical procedures. We began to experience the negative impacts of the pandemic in March 2020. The negative impact to sales continued in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, with sales decreasing by approximately 16% as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2019. Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2020 and for each quarter thereafter, our revenues increased as compared to the prior year quarters; however, this was primarily due to our Artegraft product line, which was acquired on June 22, 2020, and to a lesser extent by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nMost recently, we saw the deferral of elective procedures by hospitals in Q4 2021 in response to the Omicron variant. We currently expect COVID-19\u2019s impact on our revenues to continue into 2022, but it is difficult to estimate by how much due to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of the pandemic.\nIn addition to impacts to our sales, we have experienced other adverse impacts on our business from COVID-19, including, but not limited to, restrictions on employee travel and limitations on our sales representatives\u2019 access to customers, as well as reduced surgeon training. While we expect the impacts of COVID-19 to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.\nSupply chain disruptions could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nGlobal supply chains have been disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the availability of raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products may be adversely impacted. Additionally, even when we are able to source such materials and components, they may cost more and may only be available on a delayed basis. Higher materials and component costs could adversely affect our margins if we are unable to pass such costs along to customers in the form of price increases. Delays in receipt of materials and components could also interrupt our production and cause us to go into backorder on certain of our products, further exacerbating the global supply chain disruption.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and products into our business, or we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.\nIn order to expand our product offerings, we have completed 24 acquisitions, and a key part of our strategy is to acquire additional businesses, products, or technologies in the future. Our growth strategy depends, in part, upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete, and integrate suitable acquisitions. If we are unable to complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all, our growth objectives and sales could be negatively affected.\nEven if we complete acquisitions, we may experience:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating any acquired businesses, personnel, and products into our existing business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in integrating manufacturing operations into our existing business or successfully replicating manufacturing processes at new manufacturing facilities on a cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\ndegradation in our corporate gross margin due to lower margins associated with our acquired devices;\n\u2022\nthe sudden reduction in volume or loss of orders from a key customer, particularly where the acquired company had concentrated sales;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nhigher costs of integration than anticipated;\n\u2022\nunknown or unanticipated liabilities included as part of the acquisition;\n\u2022\ndisputes or litigation with former owners related to contingent payments, liabilities assumed or not assumed or other matters;\n\u2022\nchallenges in complying with new regulatory requirements to which we were not previously subject;\n\u2022\nincreased regulatory scrutiny;\n\u2022\nchallenges in transferring, maintaining or obtaining regulatory approvals for acquired products;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties if the acquired company is remote or inconvenient to our Burlington, Massachusetts, headquarters, such as the operations we acquired in 2018 in Saint-Etienne, France;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in transitioning clinical studies or unfavorable results from such clinical studies;\n\u2022\nloss of key suppliers or issues with the ongoing supply of the acquired product from its former owners;\n\u2022\ncharges related to the acquisition of in-process research and development;\n\u2022\ndilution as a result of equity financing required to fund acquisition costs; or\n\u2022\ndebt, as a result of financing to fund acquisitions, which we incurred to acquire Artegraft and is senior to our common stock, requires interest payments to our lenders, and could restrict our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nFor example, the manufacturing process for our Omniflow II graft, which we acquired in 2014, is currently being transferred to our Burlington headquarters due to our discontinuation of operations in North Melbourne, Australia in June 2020. While the MDD CE mark for Omniflow II has been secured, the startup validation activities have been delayed and as a result, Burlington-built product is not yet available for sale on the European market. We expect that the inventory of the majority of such products held by our European subsidiary will only be sufficient to supply customers until partly through Q1 2022, and as a result, we are beginning to experience backorders for Omniflow II, which will continue until the validation activities are approved by our notified body. We believe these backorders could result in a reduction in, or deferral of, $1.0 million in sales in H1 2022. If the approval of these validation activities for Omniflow II is materially delayed or withheld, our European revenues could be further impacted and our business could be harmed.\nWe could also discover deficiencies withheld from us due to fraud or otherwise not uncovered in our due diligence prior to an acquisition, including but not limited to deficiencies in internal controls, data adequacy and integrity, product quality, and regulatory compliance, as well as undisclosed contractual or other liabilities and product liabilities, any of which could result in us becoming subject to penalties or other liabilities. Any of these difficulties could negatively impact our ability to realize the intended and anticipated benefits that we currently expect from our acquisitions or from future acquisitions, and could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor any of these reasons or as a result of other factors, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and our operating results may be harmed.\nOur call point focus on the vascular surgeon with a product portfolio largely used in open vascular surgical procedures may be too narrow, which may adversely affect our future sales.\nThe treatment of peripheral vascular disease continues to shift from open vascular surgery to minimally invasive endovascular procedures. For example, some vascular surgeons have begun using transcarotid arterial revascularization, a new minimally invasive procedure, to treat carotid artery disease in lieu of a procedure in which our carotid shunts and vascular patches are used. We market and sell our products primarily to vascular surgeons, and the majority of our marketing efforts and sales relate to products used in open vascular surgery rather than in endovascular procedures. We estimate that in 2021, over 90% of our net sales were from devices used in open vascular procedures.\nDemographic trends and other factors, such as reimbursement rates, are driving vascular surgeons to increasingly specialize in certain kinds of procedures, such as the creation and maintenance of dialysis access sites and endovascular therapies. Vascular surgeon training programs may focus on those therapies to the exclusion of open vascular procedures. If there is a decline in vascular surgeons training in open vascular procedures in favor of training in minimally invasive endovascular procedures, this could limit the number of vascular surgeons using our products due to lack of open vascular skills. Further, even those physicians trained in open procedures may discontinue performing them if there is a lack of demand. If this trend continues, it could lead to the fragmentation of our customer base, which would reduce cross-selling opportunities and the efficiency of each sales call by our sales representatives, which in turn could negatively impact our business.\nCardioCel is sold to a different call point from that of most of our product lines, and we may not be successful in selling to that call point.\nHistorically, the majority of sales of CardioCel have been to pediatric cardiac surgeons, a call point that is different from our main call point focus. We market and sell our products primarily to vascular surgeons, and the majority of our marketing efforts and sales relate to products used in open vascular surgery. As a result, our sales representatives call predominantly on vascular surgeons and to a lesser extent, cardiac and neuro surgeons. Our success in selling CardioCel will depend, in part, on our sales representatives devoting a portion of their time to making sales calls to, and establishing relationships with, pediatric cardiac surgeons. If they do not undertake these activities or are unsuccessful in doing so, then this could lead to the loss of CardioCel sales and customers, and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. Most of our product lines are used in vascular procedures and as a result, our sales representatives are able to cross-sell most of our product portfolio to vascular surgeons. Cross-selling opportunities to pediatric cardiac surgeons are limited. Additionally, if our sales representatives spend less time focused on vascular surgeons, the sales of our vascular products could decrease, and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nOur tissue processing and preservation services are subject to a variety of risks, including those related to the procurement of human tissue and regulatory requirements.\nOur ability to successfully provide RestoreFlow allograft processing, preservation and distribution services may be affected by the following:\n\u2022\nmaintenance of quality standards and controls to mitigate the risk that processed tissue cannot be sterilized;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory and legal requirements specific to human tissue, with which we were previously unfamiliar before our 2016 acquisition of the RestoreFlow operations, or changes in those requirements;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of our AATB accreditation, FDA establishment registration and state licensures;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which our tissue procurement organizations are successful in procuring the gift of tissue donation;\n\u2022\nprocurement from tissue procurement organizations of adequate amounts of human tissue of a type and quality that meets our specifications, particularly as we may compete for these tissues with organizations who may have greater resources than us and as procurement of cadavers has been challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nprocessing human tissue in a cost effective manner;\n\u2022\ncontrolling turnover in a workforce skilled in tissue processing and cryopreservation and any subsequent delay necessary for the adequate training of new personnel; and\n\u2022\ncompliance of our tissue procurement organizations to current good tissue practices and our own procurement procedures.\nOur failure in any one or more of these areas could adversely impact our ability to provide processing, preservation and distribution services related to allografts and therefore our business and operations.\nOur dependence on sole- and limited-source suppliers could hinder our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers on a timely basis or at all and could harm our results of operations.\nWe rely on sole- and limited-source suppliers for some of our important components and certain products. For example, we rely on a sole-source supplier for ovine material used in our Omniflow II graft.\nWith respect to our RestoreFlow allografts, we rely on tissue procurement organizations to provide donated tissue to us for processing and cryopreservation. While we have relationships with multiple tissue procurement organizations, we cannot be sure that the supply of suitable human tissue will be available to us at the levels we need, in which case our allograft service revenues could be adversely affected.\nWhen we acquire a product line, we often enter into an agreement with the seller of the product line for a period of one to three years for the supply of the acquired product until we can transition manufacturing to our facilities. Those arrangements are always sole source supply arrangements with a supplier that has determined to divest the product it is manufacturing. As a result, the supplier may not allocate sufficient resources to the manufacture of our product in favor of dedicating resources to its remaining business. Additionally, there is significant risk if the supplier does not have the financial means to continue to supply product. For example, in the case of our 2019 acquisition of the CardioCel and VascuCel biologic patches, Anteris Technologies Ltd (formerly known as Admedus Ltd) and its affiliates have agreed to continue to supply those products to us until July 2023. If Anteris fails to meet its obligations under the supply agreement on a timely basis, or at all, then we may experience interruptions in our supply of the acquired products or we may not receive a future supply of the acquired products until we establish our own manufacturing. If we do not have sufficient supply of an acquired product, this could lead to loss of sales, customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation, and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nThere are relatively few, or in some cases no, alternative, validated sources of supply for these materials and products. We do not always have supply agreements in place with suppliers, instead placing orders on an as-needed basis. At any time, these suppliers could discontinue or become incapable of the manufacture or supply of these materials or products on acceptable terms or otherwise. We do not ordinarily carry a significant inventory of these materials and products. Identifying and qualifying additional or replacement suppliers, if required, may not be accomplished quickly or at all and could involve significant additional costs. Any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain replacement suppliers would interrupt our ability to manufacture our products and result in production delays and increased costs, and may limit our ability to deliver products to our customers. This could lead to loss of sales and customers, and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In some cases, changes to raw material suppliers or use of alternative raw materials may require significant testing and subsequent approval by our regulatory bodies. These approval processes could result in significant delays or refusal to approve, which could further limit our ability to deliver products to our customers and harm our sales.\nAny disruption in our manufacturing facilities could harm our results of operations.\nOur principal worldwide executive, distribution, and manufacturing operations are located in five leased facilities in Burlington, Massachusetts. We also have manufacturing sites in North Brunswick, New Jersey and Saint-Etienne, France as well as a tissue processing preservation and distribution facility in Fox River Grove, Illinois. These facilities and the equipment we use to manufacture our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead-time to repair or replace in the event of a natural or man-made disaster. In such event, we could not shift production or processing to alternate manufacturing facilities, and we would be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers, if available at all. Although we carry insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses, including potential damage to our reputation, and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe depend on our senior management team and other key sales and technical personnel, and if we are unable to retain them or recruit additional qualified personnel we may not be able to manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives.\nWe depend on the continued services of our senior management team and other key sales and technical personnel, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. Each of our key employees may terminate his or her employment with us at any time, and the loss of any of our senior management team or key employees could harm our business. Because we compete for such personnel with other companies, academic institutions, government entities, and other organizations, we may not be able to meet our future hiring needs or retain existing personnel on acceptable terms. Any loss or interruption of the services of our key personnel could also significantly reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations and meet our commercial or strategic objectives, because we cannot be sure that we would be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis.\nCertain of our products contain materials derived from animal sources and may become subject to additional regulation.\nOur AlboGraft vascular graft, Artegraft biologic patch, Dialine II vascular graft, Wovex vascular graft, XenoSure biologic patch, ProCol vascular graft and CardioCel and VascuCel patch products contain bovine tissue or material derived from bovine sources, and our Omniflow II Biosynthetic Vascular Graft contains ovine tissue. Products that contain materials derived from animal sources are increasingly subject to scrutiny in the media and by regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities are concerned about the potential for the transmission of disease from animals to humans via those materials. This public scrutiny has been particularly acute in Japan and Western Europe with respect to products derived from animal sources because of concern that bovine materials infected with the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy, otherwise known as BSE or mad cow disease, may, if ingested or implanted, cause a variant of the human Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, an ultimately fatal disease with no known cure. Cases of BSE in cattle discovered in Canada and the U.S. have also increased awareness of the issue in North America. Certain regions or countries have issued regulations that require products to be processed from bovine tissue sourced from countries, like Australia or New Zealand, where no cases of BSE have occurred. Products that contain materials derived from animals, including our products, may become subject to additional regulation, or even be banned in certain countries, because of concern over the potential for the transmission of infectious agents. Significant new regulation, or a ban of our products, could impair our current business or our ability to expand our business, and in the case of a ban or suspension, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face intense competition from other companies, technologies, and alternative medical procedures and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe segments in which we compete are highly competitive, subject to change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Although no one company competes against us in all of our product lines or services, a number of manufacturers of peripheral vascular devices have substantially greater capital resources, larger customer bases, broader product lines, larger sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs, and larger facilities than ours; have established reputations with our target customers; and have developed worldwide distribution channels that are more effective than ours. Our competitors could elect to devote additional resources to the segments in which we currently enjoy less competition. Also, although we currently have leading positions in the segments for some of our products, this is not true for all of our products. From time to time, we have experienced difficulties competing against large companies.\nOur competitors may be companies which are larger than us and have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, regulatory, marketing, sales, and personnel resources than we do. Certain competitors are able to manufacture at lower costs and may offer comparable products at lower prices. Certain competitors may also have greater experience in developing and improving products, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing products. Certain competitors may obtain patent protection or regulatory approval or clearance, or achieve product commercialization, before us, any of which could materially adversely affect us. Further, if the trend towards endovascular procedures versus open vascular procedures continues or accelerates, our competitors may be better poised to take advantage of that trend, since our main product lines are used primarily in open vascular procedures. New product developments that could compete with us more effectively are likely because the vascular disease market is characterized by extensive research efforts and technological progress. Competitors may develop technologies and products that are safer, more effective, easier to use, less expensive, or more readily accepted than ours. Their products could make our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors may also be able to achieve more efficient manufacturing and distribution operations than we can. In addition, many of our products face competition from alternative procedures that utilize different kinds of medical devices than we currently sell. Increased competition could also result in price reductions and loss of market share, any of which could result in lower revenues and reduced gross profits.\nIf we are unable to increase our selling prices to customers, or if we are required to make price concessions, our rate of net sales growth could be reduced and our operating results could suffer.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, a material portion of our increases in net sales was driven by higher average selling prices to our hospital customers across several of our product lines, particularly with respect to valvulotome sales. In the past, we have been able to rely upon our well-known brands and our established reputation to implement price increases.\nAdditionally, we may become unable to implement further increases in the selling prices of our products:\n\u2022\nif healthcare spending is reduced, particularly in the U.S., in response to government-enacted healthcare reform, general economic conditions, or the influence of accountable care organizations;\n\u2022\nif the reimbursement rates for the medical procedures in which our products are used are reduced or limited;\n\u2022\nif competitors introduce lower-priced products of comparable safety and efficacy; or\n\u2022\nif customers engage in information sharing regarding competitive pricing of medical devices.\nWe also expect marketplace changes to increasingly place pressure on medical device pricing as hospitals join group purchasing organizations, integrated delivery networks, managed care organizations and other groups that seek to aggregate purchasing power and as hospitals are given financial incentives to improve quality and reduce costs. Due to pricing pressures, surgeons may even perform alternative procedures making our products unnecessary.\nIf we become unable to raise selling prices, or if we are required to make price concessions, it could reduce our rate of net sales growth and harm our operating results.\nThe risks inherent in operating internationally and the risks of selling and shipping our products and of purchasing our components and products internationally may adversely impact our net sales, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe derive a significant portion of our net sales from outside of the U.S. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 39% of our net sales were derived from outside of the U.S. Our international sales operations expose us and our representatives, agents, and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations, including export licensing requirements, duties and tariffs, and other trade restrictions, whether due to, or in reaction to, changes in U.S. trade policy;\n\u2022\nthe risk of non-compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-corruption laws by our personnel, distributors and other agents, especially in areas with heightened corruption risk such as China and Russia;\n\u2022\nchanging medical device regulations that may impede our ability to register our products in a jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of U.S. and/or international sanctions against a country or party with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country or party;\n\u2022\na shortage of high-quality sales personnel and distributors;\n\u2022\nloss of any key personnel who are important to our success in certain international markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in third-party reimbursement policies that may require some of the patients who receive our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate the reduction of the selling prices of our products;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives, and distributors;\n\u2022\nscrutiny of foreign tax authorities, which could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes on us;\n\u2022\npricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nexposure to different legal and political standards; and\n\u2022\npolitical, economic, and/or social instability.\nWe cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not harm our business. Any material decrease in our international sales would adversely impact our net sales, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe use or misuse of our products and the tissues we distribute may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.\nIf our products or the tissue we process are defectively designed, manufactured, processed or labeled, contain defective components, or are misused, or if our products or the tissues we process are found to have caused or contributed to injuries or death, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Although we offer training for physicians, we do not require that physicians be trained in the use of our products or the tissues we distribute, and physicians may use our products or the tissues we distribute incorrectly or in procedures not contemplated by us. We are from time to time involved in product liability claims. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, and result in sizable damage awards against us. Claims of this nature may also adversely affect our reputation, which could damage our position in the market and subject us to recalls.\nWe cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any claim made against us. Further, we may not be able to maintain the same level of coverage, and we may not be able to obtain adequate coverage at a reasonable cost and on reasonable terms, if at all. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing coverage in the future. Additionally, if any such product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or is in excess of our insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense.\nWe are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and litigation, including, but not limited to, actions relating to product liability, employment matters, intellectual property, contract disputes and other commercial matters. Because the outcome of litigation is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of litigation, or even simply the defense of litigation, could entail significant cost for us, divert management\u2019s time and attention and harm our business. Additionally, we could experience adverse effects of litigation even before finally adjudicated if a counterparty is granted intermediate relief such as an injunction. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. The fact that we operate in international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal exposures as we seek to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. If any such proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to convert additional countries or products from distributor sales to direct sales, or encounter difficulties in effecting such conversions, our results of operations could suffer.\nWe have a history of converting international distributor sales to direct-to-hospital sales by buying out our foreign distributor agreements and selling direct-to-hospital through our own direct sales representatives. In the future, we may elect to convert select additional countries and products from distributor sales to direct-to-hospital sales. Such conversions sometimes result in disruptions in our sales in the applicable geographies. These transitions may also have an adverse effect on our cash flow because distributors, unlike direct sales representatives, pay us for inventory which they store for later sale. In addition, switching to a direct sales force may subject us to longer customer collection times and larger bad debt expense, since we would be required to collect customer payments directly rather than bill and collect from the single distributor.\nOur distribution agreements are exclusive, where permissible, with terms of up to five years, though more typically are for terms of one to three years. These agreements may temporarily constrain our ability to convert certain countries or products from a distributor to a direct-to-hospital model. In order to ensure a successful market transition, we may compensate a distributor in connection with the termination of their distributorship, even where the payment of compensation is not required by contract or local law.\nFollowing termination of any distribution agreement, we may encounter difficulties in transitioning to a direct-to-hospital model. The transition to a direct sales model may require us to meet regulatory requirements that were previously the responsibility of the distributor, which may subject us to additional costs. It also may take us longer than expected to find qualified sales personnel to establish an effective sales force, which could negatively impact projected sales. If a distributor sold our products through a network of sales agents, rather than exclusively through its own personnel, we may not be able to establish relationships with all members of that network, temporarily limiting our access to the existing market. Similarly, failure to maintain or quickly re-establish a distributor\u2019s close relationships with the physicians who use our products could reduce sales. Further, it may be difficult or impossible to transfer the assignment of a distributor\u2019s rights to sell our products, and as a result, sales to customers may be delayed until a new agreement or approval is obtained. The transition to a direct sales model may also require us to incur additional expenses and may be time-consuming to manage remotely, as is the case with our sales office in China, which consumes a disproportionate amount of capital and other resources in view of its sales levels. As a result of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in transitioning to a direct sales model in the countries that we select, and difficulties that we encounter in these transitions could negatively affect our business.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and other currencies may adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars. While the majority of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenue and costs is denominated in other currencies, such as the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese yuan and the Australian dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 39% of our net sales were to customers outside the U.S., largely in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. Our results of operations and our operating expenses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of those operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign currency-based local operations will result in increased net assets, revenue, operating expenses, and net income. Conversely, our local currency-based net assets, revenue, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against the local currency. Additionally, receivable and payable balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency may result in gains and losses upon settlement that may adversely impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment\nOversight of the medical device industry might affect the manner in which we may sell medical devices and compete in the marketplace.\nThere are laws and regulations that govern the means by which companies in the healthcare industry may market their products and services to healthcare professionals and may compete by discounting the prices of their products and services, including for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, state law equivalents to these federal laws that are meant to protect against fraud and abuse and analogous laws in foreign countries. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Although in structuring our sales and marketing practices and customer discount arrangements we strive to comply with those laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that government officials charged with responsibility for enforcing those laws will not assert that our sales and marketing practices or customer discount arrangements are in violation of those laws or regulations or that government regulators or courts will interpret those laws or regulations in a manner consistent with our interpretation. Federal and state laws are also sometimes open to interpretation, and from time to time we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage if our interpretation differs from that of our competitors.\nOur business is subject to complex, costly, and burdensome regulations. We could be subject to significant penalties if we fail to comply.\nThe production and marketing of our products and services and our ongoing research and development are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the U.S. and abroad. U.S. and foreign regulations applicable to medical devices and human tissues are wide-ranging and govern, among other things, the testing, marketing, and premarket clearance or approval of new medical devices and services related to human tissue, as applicable, in addition to regulating manufacturing and processing practices, reporting, promotion and advertising, importing and exporting, labeling, and record-keeping procedures.\nOur failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in governmental agencies or a court taking action, including any of the following:\n\u2022\nissuing public warning letters to us;\n\u2022\nimposing fines and penalties on us;\n\u2022\nissuing an injunction preventing us from manufacturing, processing, selling or distributing our products;\n\u2022\nbringing civil or criminal charges against us;\n\u2022\ndelaying the introduction of our new products into the market;\n\u2022\nordering a recall of, or detaining or seizing, our products or cryopreserved human tissue; or\n\u2022\nwithdrawing or denying approvals or clearances for our products.\nIf any or all of the foregoing were to occur, our business, results of operations, and reputation could suffer.\nIf we are not successful in obtaining and maintaining clearances and approvals from governmental agencies for our medical devices, we will not be able to sell our products, and our future growth will be significantly hampered.\nEach medical device that we wish to market in the U.S. generally must receive either 510(k) clearance or approval of a premarket application, or PMA, from the FDA before the product can be marketed or sold. Either process can be lengthy and expensive. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance procedure usually takes three to twelve months from the date the FDA receives the application, but may take longer. Although 510(k) clearances have been obtained for nearly all of our current products that require such clearances, the FDA may condition, limit or prohibit our sales of these products if safety or effectiveness problems develop with the devices. Our new products or significantly modified existing products could be denied 510(k) clearance and required to undergo the more burdensome PMA approval process if they are not found to be substantially equivalent.\nThe PMA approval process is much more costly, lengthy, and uncertain than the premarket notification process. It generally takes from six months to three years from the date the application is submitted to, and filed with, the FDA, and may take longer. Achieving premarket approval typically requires extensive clinical trials and may require the filing of numerous amendments with the FDA over time. The FDA may also require post-approval studies to continue demonstrating the safe and effective performance of these devices. We do not have significant experience in obtaining PMA approval or conducting these studies for our products.\nThe FDA has previously proposed changes for which FDA clearance to market would possibly require clinical data, more extensive manufacturing information and post market data. As part of the 510(k) reform, the FDA proposes to issue regulations defining grounds and procedures for rescission of 510(k) applications that have previously been cleared to market. Additionally, in April 2018, the FDA announced the Medical Device Safety Action Plan: Protecting Patients, Promoting Public Health in which the FDA has proposed limiting the age of predicate devices used in 510(k) applications, thus narrowing the field of available predicates for comparison in the 510(k) process. The FDA may also require the more extensive PMA process for certain products. Our ability to market our products outside the United States is also subject to regulatory approval, including our ability to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our products in the clinical setting. Even if regulatory approval or clearance of a product is granted, the approval or clearance could limit the uses or the claims for which the product may be labeled and promoted, which may limit the market for our products. If we do not obtain and maintain foreign regulatory or FDA approval with respect to our products, as applicable, we will not be able to sell our products, and our future growth will be significantly hampered.\nIf we or some of our suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation and other applicable requirements, our manufacturing or processing operations could be disrupted, our sales and profitability could suffer, and we may become subject to a wide variety of FDA enforcement actions.\nWe are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the FDA to determine our compliance with all regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply with any regulatory requirements, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions.\nWe and some of our suppliers must comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, testing, manufacture, control, quality assurance, installation, servicing, labeling, packaging, storage, and shipping of medical devices. Our Fox River Grove operations must comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Tissue Practices, which are the FDA regulatory requirements for the processing of human tissue. The FDA enforces its regulations through pre-announced and unannounced inspections. We have been, and anticipate in the future being, subject to such inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. The timing and scope of future audits is unknown and it is possible, despite our belief that our quality systems and the operation of our manufacturing facilities will remain in compliance with U.S, and non-U.S. regulatory requirements, that a future audit may result in one or more unsatisfactory results. If we or one of our suppliers fails an inspection, or if a corrective action plan adopted by us or one of our suppliers is not sufficient, the FDA may bring an enforcement action against us, and our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing delayed.\nWe participate in the Medical Device Single Audit (MDSAP) program, which allows manufacturers to undergo a universal quality system audit that is accepted in the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada and Brazil in lieu of individual routine audits by each regulator. Maintenance of this certification is a requirement to maintain sales in certain geographies including Canada. Failure to maintain this certification in good standing could result in suspension of our sales efforts in Canada or the other geographies.\nWe are also subject to the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against promoting our products for unapproved or off-label uses and to the medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if our device malfunctions and a recurrence of the malfunction would likely result in a death or serious injury. We must also file reports with the FDA of some device corrections and removals, and we must adhere to the FDA\u2019s rules on labeling and promotion. If we fail to comply with these or other FDA requirements or fail to take adequate corrective action in response to any significant compliance issue raised by the FDA, the FDA can take significant enforcement actions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and our reputation.\nIn addition, most other countries, such as Japan, require us to comply with manufacturing and quality assurance standards for medical devices that are similar to those in force in the U.S. before marketing and selling our products in those countries. If we fail to comply, we would lose our ability to market and sell our products in those foreign countries.\nEven after our products have received marketing approval or clearance, our products and the tissue we process may be subject to product recalls. Licenses, registrations, approvals and clearances could be withdrawn or suspended due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval.\nOur products, services, marketing, sales and development activities, and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA, by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. These authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. If those regulatory bodies feel that we have failed to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter unforeseen problems following initial approval, licensure or registration, there can be no assurance that any approval, licensure or registration will not be subsequently withdrawn, suspended or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements, even after having received marketing approval or clearance or licenses and registrations. Further, due to the increased scrutiny of our industry by the various regulatory agencies and the interconnectedness of the various regulatory agencies, particularly within the EU, there is also no assurance that withdrawal or suspension of any of our approvals, licenses or registrations by any single regulatory agency will not precipitate one or more additional regulatory agencies from also withdrawing or suspending their approval, license or registration.\nIn the event that any of our products prove to be defective, we can voluntarily recall, or the FDA or foreign equivalent could require us to implement a recall of or prohibit the sale of, any of our products. For example, in March 2020 we conducted a worldwide recall of a substantial number of our TufTex over-the-wire embolectomy catheters due to a risk of the balloon catheter failing to deflate during use. We experienced backorders for these products while we addressed this issue. Recalls, whether voluntary or required, could result in significant costs to us and significant adverse publicity, which could harm our ability to market our products in the future.\nWith respect to our RestoreFlow allografts, we may voluntarily recall tissue, and in the event of non-compliance with the regulations governing human tissue, the FDA may issue a warning letter, order the recall and/or destruction of tissues and/or order the suspension or cessation of processing and preservation of new tissues.\nAdditionally, if someone is harmed by a malfunction or a product defect, we may experience product liability claims for such defects. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital and may harm our reputation and financial results. Future recalls or claims could also result in significant costs to us and significant adverse publicity, which could harm our ability to market our products in the future.\nDomestic and foreign legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors and cost containment measures could decrease the demand for products purchased by our customers, the prices that our customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures using our devices.\nOur products and our tissue preservation services are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable foreign programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of our products and services because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new technology. Implementation of healthcare reforms in the U.S. and in significant overseas markets such as Germany, Japan, France and other countries may limit, reduce or eliminate reimbursement for our products and services and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and the demand for our products and services. Even when we develop or acquire a promising new product or service, we may find limited demand for the product or service unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors.\nMajor third-party payors for hospital services in the U.S. and abroad continue to work to contain healthcare costs through, among other things, the introduction of cost containment incentives and closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers. For example, in an effort to decrease costs, certain hospitals and other customers may resterilize our products intended for a single use or purchase reprocessed products from third-party reprocessors in lieu of purchasing new products from us.\nFurther legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the U.S. and abroad, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or result in the denial of coverage for those procedures. Examples of these reforms or adverse decisions include price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements. Any of such reforms or adverse decisions resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices or denials of coverage could have an adverse impact on the acceptance of our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or prevent use of our intellectual property by third parties, we could lose a significant competitive advantage and our business may suffer.\nOur success depends in part on maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights, and our ability to avoid infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property. We rely upon patent, trade secret, copyright, know-how, and trademark laws, as well as license agreements and contractual provisions, to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products. These measures may only afford limited protection and may not prevent our competitors from duplicating our products or services or from gaining access to our proprietary information and technology.\nWe have few patents on our technology. Even where we do have patents, the issuance of a patent is not always conclusive as to its validity or enforceability. Any patents we have obtained or could obtain in the future might also be invalidated or circumvented by third parties. Additionally, competitors may be able to design around our patents to produce alternative, non-infringing designs. In such cases, competitors might be able to market products and use manufacturing processes that are substantially similar to ours. Furthermore, patents expire after a certain duration, depending on the jurisdiction in which issued. To the extent any manufacturers are successful in challenging our patents or they enter the market following the expiration of our patents, this could have an adverse impact on our business and harm our sales and operating results.\nAdditionally, we may not be able to effectively protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. We have a policy of requiring key employees and consultants and corporate partners with access to trade secrets or other confidential information to execute confidentiality agreements. Our confidentiality agreements also require our employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us. We also generally require our consultants to assign to us any inventions made during the course of their engagement by us. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for us in the event of unauthorized use, transfer, or disclosure of confidential information or inventions.\nIn addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, we may not be able to commercialize our technologies, products, or services and our competitors could commercialize similar technologies, which could result in a decrease in our sales and market share.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs, and we may have to redesign or discontinue selling the affected product.\nThe medical device industry is litigious with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies operating in our industry often seek patent protection for their novel product designs, and many of our principal competitors have large patent portfolios. Companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Whether a product infringes a patent or other intellectual property rights involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. We face the risk of claims that we have infringed on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, and we cannot assure you that our products or methods do not infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights may not always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could:\n\u2022\nbe expensive and time consuming to defend;\n\u2022\nresult in us being required to pay significant damages to third parties for past use of the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022\nharm our reputation;\n\u2022\ncause us to cease making or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nrequire us to redesign, reengineer, or rebrand our products, which may not be possible and could be costly and time consuming if it is possible to do so at all;\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property, which agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022\ndivert the attention of our management and key personnel from other tasks important to the success of our business; or\n\u2022\nresult in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation.\nIt is also possible that a third party could claim that our manufacturing process violates an existing patent or other intellectual property rights. If we were unsuccessful in defending such a claim, we may be forced to stop production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, new patents obtained by our competitors could threaten a product\u2019s continued life in the market even after it has already been introduced. If our business is successful, the possibility may increase that others will assert infringement claims against us.\nIf we believe our product is or may be the subject of a patent or other intellectual property rights of a third party, we may attempt to reach a license agreement with them to manufacture, market, and sell these products. If we fail to reach an agreement, we could be required to pay significant damages to third parties for past use of the asserted intellectual property and may be forced to cease making or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property.\nIn addition, we may become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the United States Patent Office or opposition proceedings conducted in foreign patent offices challenging the priority of invention or the validity of our patents.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere can be significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities that is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Shareholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased them due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects, a reduced volume of trading in our common stock, and other factors.\nSome factors that may have a significant effect on our common stock market price include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u2022\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of new products;\n\u2022\npublic concern as to the safety or efficacy of our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nour determination whether or not to continue the payment of quarterly cash dividends;\n\u2022\nour determination whether or not to undertake or continue a share repurchase program;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings;\n\u2022\ndilutive issuances of additional securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour inability to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nthe discontinuation of a product line or other revenue generating activity;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory actions which may necessitate recalls of our products or services or warning letters that negatively affect the markets for our products or services;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us or our directors, officers, or principal stockholders;\n\u2022\ncontrol by our affiliates and insiders of a significant percentage of our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our common stock, comparable companies, or our industry generally;\n\u2022\nreduced or lower volume of trading in our common stock; and\n\u2022\nour inclusion in or removal from stock market indices, such as the S&P 600 or Russell 2000.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. The market price of our common shares may also fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors unrelated to our financial results, including political instability, natural disasters, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 global pandemic), war and/or events of terrorism; comments by securities analysts; and general market conditions in our industry or in the economy as a whole. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies\u2019 stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur chief executive officer has significant voting power and may take actions that may not align with the interests of our other stockholders.\nOur chief executive officer controls approximately 12% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2021. As a result, he could have significant influence on many matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, might adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and may not be fully aligned with the interests of other stockholders.\nWe have not established a minimum dividend payment level for our common stockholders and there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends to common stockholders in the future.\nIn February 2011, our Board of Directors adopted a quarterly dividend program for the purpose of returning capital to our stockholders. However, we have not established a minimum dividend payment level for our common stockholders and our ability to pay dividends may be harmed by the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the other documents we file from time to time with the SEC. Future dividends, if any, will be authorized by our Board of Directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors deemed relevant by our directors, including, among other things, our financial condition, liquidity, earnings projections and business prospects. In addition, financial covenants in our credit facility may restrict our ability to pay future quarterly dividends. We can provide no assurance of our ability to pay dividends in the future.", "PERMNO": 91503, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "LMAT"}
