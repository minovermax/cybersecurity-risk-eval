{"cik": "1325879", "company": "AVEO PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. We caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors and oral statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosure we make in our reports filed with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may be forced to delay or reduce the scope of our development programs and/or limit or cease our operations if we are unable to obtain additional funding to support our current operating plan. We have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $47.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Based on our available cash resources, we believe we do not have sufficient cash on hand to support current operations for more than twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are issued. Management\u2019s plans in this regard are described in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional funding when needed or that such funding, if available, will be obtainable\non terms satisfactory to us. In the event that these plans cannot be effectively realized, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. It is uncertain if we will ever attain profitability.\nWe have a history of incurring operating losses and as of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $585.6 million. To date, we have not commercialized any products or generated any material revenues from the sale of products. Absent the realization of sufficient revenues from product sales, we may never attain profitability. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our discovery and development activities. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating costs over the next several years as we seek to develop and commercialize our product candidates. As noted above, we have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf we do not successfully develop and obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our existing and future pipeline of product candidates and effectively manufacture, market and sell any product candidates that are approved, we may never generate product sales. Even if we do generate product sales, we may never achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations.\nWe will require substantial additional funding, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed would force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or commercialization efforts.\nWe will require substantial additional funds to continue our development programs and to fulfill our planned operating goals. In particular, our currently planned operating and capital requirements include the need for substantial working capital to support development and commercialization activities for tivozanib.\nMoreover, we have future payment obligations and cost-sharing arrangements under certain of our collaboration and license agreements. For example, under our agreements with KKC and St. Vincent\u2019s, we are required to make certain clinical and regulatory milestone payments, have royalty obligations with respect to product sales and are required to pay a portion of sublicense revenue in certain instances.\nWe believe that our approximate $47.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2019, along with anticipated partnership payments from cost sharing obligations and royalty revenues from sales of FOTIVDA by EUSA, would allow us to fund our planned operations into the second quarter of 2021. However, based on our available cash resources, we believe we do not have sufficient cash on hand to support current operations for more than twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See \u201c- We have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d Accordingly, the timing and nature of activities contemplated for the remainder of 2020 and thereafter will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nFurthermore, there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, our future capital requirements may vary from our current expectations and depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of the product candidates we pursue;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates and of conducting preclinical and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, completing our clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;\n\u2022\nthe absence of any breach, acceleration event or event of default under our loan agreement with Hercules Capital Inc., or Hercules, which we refer to as the 2017 Loan Agreement with Hercules, or under any other agreements with third parties;\n\u2022\nthe cost and outcome of any legal actions against us, including the current lawsuits described below under the heading \u201cPart I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d;\n\u2022\nthe cost of commercialization activities if any of our product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing our product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize;\n\u2022\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, FOTIVDA and our future products, if any; and\n\u2022\nour ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe will require additional funding to extend our planned operations. We may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock or through additional credit facilities, these securities and/or the loans under credit facilities could provide for rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We also expect to seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators, licensees or other third parties. These arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates, and we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we were to default under the 2017 Loan Agreement with Hercules, Hercules may accelerate the then remaining principal payments and fees due under the loan and we may be required to:\n\u2022\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our clinical trials or other development activities for one or more of our product candidates; and/or\n\u2022\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved.\nWe are a development stage company, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nOther than the European and the New Zealand marketing approvals for tivozanib (FOTIVDA) received by our partner EUSA in August 2017 and July 2019, respectively, all of our product candidates are in the development stage. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale medicine, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Typically, it takes about 10 to 15 years to develop one new medicine from the time it is discovered to when it is available for treating patients. Preclinical studies and clinical trials may involve highly uncertain results and a high risk of failure. Moreover, positive data from preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of results in ongoing or subsequent preclinical studies and clinical trials and may not demonstrate the results necessary to support the filing of an NDA with the FDA or to obtain marketing approval in a particular market. For example, although we announced positive topline results for the primary endpoint of the TIVO-3 trial in November 2018, in January 2019, the FDA recommended that we not submit an NDA for tivozanib at that time as the first interim OS results from the TIVO-3 trial did not allay its concerns about a potential detriment in OS from the TIVO-1 trial. In August 2019, we performed a second prespecified interim OS analysis, which showed an updated OS hazard ratio of 0.99 (p=0.95), estimating that tivozanib resulted in a 1% lower risk of death for patients in the trial relative to sorafenib. In our subsequent meeting with the FDA to discuss the results of the August 2019 interim OS analysis, the FDA indicated that it remained concerned about the results of the TIVO-3 trial in the context of the overall development of tivozanib and noted that the TIVO-3 OS may worsen upon the final analysis. We and the FDA agreed that if we file an NDA and the final analysis yielded an OS hazard ratio above 1.00, we will withdraw our NDA.\nAny NDA we submit to the FDA may not be accepted for submission or approved by the FDA and even if approved, we may not be able to successfully commercialize tivozanib in the United States. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had more experience developing and commercializing our product candidates.\nIn addition, as a development stage business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. To be profitable, we will need to transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.\nRisks Related to our Litigation\nWe concluded a settlement with the SEC, but the SEC\u2019s action against our former officer has not concluded.\nIn 2016, we paid $4.0 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the SEC in federal court alleging that we violated federal securities laws by omitting to disclose the recommendation of the staff of the FDA, on May 11, 2012, that we conduct an additional clinical trial with respect to tivozanib. The SEC also named three of our former officers as defendants in the same lawsuit. The SEC and two of our former officers settled. In November 2018, the District Court jury ruled against the remaining former officer. In April 2019, that individual moved for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative for a new trial. In October 2019, the District Court denied the motion and in December 2019, the individual filed a notice of appeal with the First Circuit Court of Appeals. He has continued to seek advancement of legal expenses or indemnification for any losses, either of which could be material to the extent not covered by our director and officer liability insurance.\nWe and certain of our present and former officers have been named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit that could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention.\nWe and certain of our present and former officers were named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit filed on February 25, 2019 and amended on July 24, 2019. The amended complaint generally alleges that we and our officers violated Sections 10(b) and/or 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by failing to disclose and/or making allegedly false and/or misleading statements about the estimated dates by which we would report the topline results from the TIVO-3 trial, the preliminary overall survival results from the TIVO-3 trial, the sufficiency of the overall survival data from the TIVO-3 trial, the timing of the NDA submission, and the risk of FDA approval. The amended complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and other costs. On September 27, 2019, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 4, 2019, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, and on January 15, 2020, we filed a reply in support of our motion to dismiss.\nOn July 8, 2019 and July 10, 2019, two derivative lawsuits were filed against us, certain of our present and former officers and our directors in Suffolk Superior Court, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The complaints generally allege breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets. On July 24, 2019, the parties filed a joint motion to consolidate the cases and stay the consolidated matter pending the dismissal of, or filing of an answer to, the complaint in the related securities class action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On July 26, 2019, the court granted that motion.\nWe intend to engage in a vigorous defense of these lawsuits. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters at this time. Moreover, any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business. For example, we could incur substantial costs not covered by our liability insurance, suffer a significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from other priorities, including the execution of business plans and strategies that are important to our ability to grow our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any of these matters could require payments that are not covered by, or exceed the limits of, our available liability insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Development and Commercialization of Our Drug Candidates\nIn the near term, we are substantially dependent on the success of tivozanib. If we are unable to complete the clinical development of, obtain and maintain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize tivozanib, either alone or with our collaborators, or if we experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be substantially harmed.\nOther than the European and the New Zealand marketing approvals for tivozanib (FOTIVDA) received by our partner EUSA in August 2017 and July 2019, respectively, we currently have no products approved for sale and are investing a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of tivozanib for marketing approval in North America. Our prospects are substantially dependent on our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize tivozanib in North America in one or more disease indications.\nThe success of tivozanib will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe acceptability to the FDA of the final OS hazard ratio in the TIVO-3 trial;\n\u2022\nour ability to secure the substantial additional capital required to complete clinical trials of tivozanib, including the DEDUCTIVE trial, and to fund the activities necessary to successfully commercially launch tivozanib if it receives regulatory approval for marketing in the United States;\n\u2022\nsuccessful design, enrollment and completion of clinical trials;\n\u2022\na safety, tolerability and efficacy profile that is satisfactory to the FDA, EMA or any other comparable foreign regulatory authority for marketing approval;\n\u2022\ntimely receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities such as the FDA;\n\u2022\nthe performance of the contract research organizations, or CROs, we have hired to manage our clinical studies, as well as that of our collaborators and other third-party contractors;\n\u2022\nthe extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of existing or establishment of new supply arrangements with third-party raw materials suppliers and manufacturers including with respect to the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredient for tivozanib and finished drug product that is appropriately packaged for sale;\n\u2022\nadequate ongoing availability of raw materials and drug product for clinical development and any commercial sales;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally, including our ability to maintain our license agreement with KKC;\n\u2022\nprotection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio, including our ability to maintain our license agreement with KKC;\n\u2022\nsuccessful launch of commercial sales following any marketing approval;\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety profile following any marketing approval;\n\u2022\ncommercial acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022\nsuccessful identification of biomarkers for patient selection; and\n\u2022\nour ability to compete with other therapies.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, including clinical trial results, the availability of adequate capital, the regulatory approval process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights and the development, manufacturing, marketing and sales efforts of our collaborators. For example, in the FDA\u2019s feedback regarding the August 2019 OS analysis, the FDA stated that it remained concerned about the results of TIVO-3 in the context of the overall development of tivozanib and recommended that we not submit an NDA for tivozanib at that time. We plan to submit an NDA at the end of the first quarter of 2020. We and the FDA agreed that if the final analysis, which we expect to report by June 2020, yielded an OS hazard ratio above 1.00, we will withdraw our NDA. If we are unable to develop, receive marketing approval for and successfully commercialize tivozanib on our own or with our collaborators, or experience delays as a result of any of these factors or otherwise, our business could be substantially harmed.\nIf we fail to develop and commercialize other product candidates, we may be unable to grow our business.\nAlthough the development and commercialization of tivozanib is our primary focus, as part of our growth strategy, we are developing a pipeline of product candidates. These other product candidates will require additional, time-consuming and costly development efforts, by us or by our collaborators, prior to commercial sale, including preclinical studies, clinical trials and approval by the FDA and/or applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to the risks of failure that are inherent in pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such products that are approved will be manufactured or produced economically, successfully commercialized or widely accepted in the marketplace, or will be more effective than other commercially available alternatives.\nResults of early clinical trials may not be predictive of results of later clinical trials, and interim results of clinical trials may not be predictive of the final results or the success of clinical trials.\nThe outcome of early clinical trials, such as our phase 1b/2 TiNivo trial, our phase 1b/2 DEDUCTIVE trial and our CyFi-1 trial, may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier development, and we have, and could in the future, face similar setbacks. In addition, interim results and analyses of clinical trials do not necessarily predict the final results or the success of a trial once it is complete. For example, the first interim OS analysis for our TIVO-3 trial showed an OS hazard ratio of 1.12 (p =0.44). In August 2019, we performed a second prespecified interim OS analysis, which showed an updated OS hazard ratio of 0.99 (p=0.95). We intend to conduct a final OS analysis for the TIVO-3 trial in the second quarter of 2020. At this time, we cannot say the degree to which these interim results will be indicative of the final trial results.\nWhile the design of a clinical trial may help to establish whether its results will support approval of a product, flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if we, or any collaborators, believe that the results of clinical trials for our product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of our product candidates. For example, in June 2013, the FDA issued the 2013 CRL informing us that it would not approve tivozanib for the first-line treatment of RCC based solely on the data from the TIVO-1 trial, and recommended that we perform an additional clinical trial adequately sized to assure the FDA that tivozanib does not adversely affect OS. Our current TIVO-3 clinical trial was designed to address the FDA\u2019s concerns about the negative OS trend expressed in the 2013 CRL. However, the FDA has informed us that our interim OS results to date have not abrogated its concerns regarding OS. In the FDA\u2019s feedback regarding the August 2019 OS analysis, the FDA recommended that we not submit an NDA for tivozanib at that time. The FDA noted that the TIVO-3 OS results may worsen with final analysis. We and the FDA agreed that if we file an NDA and the final analysis yielded an OS hazard ratio above 1.00, we will withdraw our NDA.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. If we fail to receive positive results in clinical trials of our product candidates, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for our most advanced product candidates, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects would be negatively impacted.\nIf preclinical or clinical trials of any product candidates that we or our collaborators may develop fail to demonstrate satisfactory safety and efficacy to the FDA and other regulators, we or our collaborators may incur additional costs or delays or may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of these product candidates.\nWe and any collaborators, including our partners and sublicensees, are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA. Foreign regulatory authorities, such as the EMA, impose similar requirements. We and our collaborators must complete extensive preclinical development and clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans before we can obtain these approvals.\nPreclinical and clinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, and can take many years to complete. It is inherently uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. The preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent at any stage of product development, as well as failure to demonstrate efficacy at all in a clinical trial or across a broad population of patients, the occurrence of adverse events that are medically severe or commercially unacceptable, failure to comply with protocols or regulatory requirements and determination by the applicable regulatory authority that a product candidate may not continue development or is not approvable. Even if a product candidate has a beneficial effect, that effect may not be detected during preclinical or clinical evaluation due to a variety of factors, including the size, duration, design, measurements, conduct or analysis of our preclinical and clinical trials. Conversely, as a result of the same factors, our preclinical or clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any. Similarly, in our preclinical or clinical trials we may fail to detect toxicity or intolerability of our product candidates, or mistakenly believe that our product candidates are toxic or not well tolerated when that is not in fact the case.\nAny inability to timely or successfully complete preclinical and clinical development and demonstrate the results necessary to support regulatory approvals could result in additional unplanned costs and impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. Moreover, if we, or any collaborators, are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those planned, or if the results of these trials or tests are unfavorable, uncertain, only modestly favorable or indicate safety concerns, we or our collaborators, may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing or other requirements; or\n\u2022\nbe required to remove the product from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur failure to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval would significantly harm our business.\nAdverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, tivozanib or our other product candidates may be identified during development and could delay or prevent their marketing approval or limit their use.\nAdverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, tivozanib or our other product candidates could cause us, any collaborators, an institutional review board or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt preclinical or clinical trials of one or more of our product candidates and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If any of our product candidates is associated with adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, we, or any collaborators, may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound.\nIf we or our collaborators experience any of a number of possible complications in connection with preclinical or clinical trials of our product candidates, potential clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nWe or our collaborators may experience numerous complications in connection with preclinical or clinical trials that could delay or prevent clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates including:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us, any collaborators or our or their investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to reach agreement on clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\nunfavorable or inconclusive clinical trial results;\n\u2022\nour decision or a regulatory recommendation or order to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for our clinical trials may be larger than anticipated, patient enrollment may be slower than anticipated or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe costs of our clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors, including those manufacturing our product candidates, or conducting clinical trials on our behalf, may fail to successfully comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\npatients that enroll in a clinical trial may misrepresent their eligibility to do so or may otherwise not comply with the clinical trial protocol, resulting in the need to increase the needed enrollment size for the clinical trial, extend the clinical trial\u2019s duration, or drop the patients from the final efficacy analysis for the clinical trial, which can negatively affect the statistical power of the results;\n\u2022\nour decision, or a decision by regulators or institutional review boards, that may require us to suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their standards of conduct, a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate or findings of undesirable effects caused by a chemically or mechanistically similar product or product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our or our collaborators\u2019 clinical trial designs or interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we, or any collaborators, enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of raw materials or manufactured product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient, inadequate or not available at an acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions in supply; and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient to obtain marketing approval.\nAdditionally, our clinical trial sites are located both in the United States and in Europe, which have been and are likely to continue to be affected by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. For example, we have been informed by our CRO that in-person site monitoring visits are currently on hold in Italy and that the impact of the virus on monitoring visits for other sites, as well as its broader potential impact on our trials, is continuing to be assessed. Any limitation on our CRO\u2019s ability to conduct our trials may have a material adverse impact on our ability to collect and report trial data for TIVO-3 and our other trials.\nProduct development costs for us and our collaborators will increase if we experience delays in testing or pursuing marketing approvals, and we may be required to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials and prepare for possible commercialization. We do not know whether any trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule or at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that lead to clinical trial delays may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of any of our product candidates.\nIf we or our collaborators experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe or our collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in clinical trials. Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, and is affected by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe size and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022\nthe severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nthe availability of approved therapeutics for the relevant disease;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of patients to clinical sites;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility criteria for the trial;\n\u2022\nthe design of the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nefforts to facilitate timely enrollment; and\n\u2022\ncompeting clinical trials.\nIn addition, participation in our clinical trials will be affected by clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages and risks of the drug being studied and the drug being provided as a control in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. For example, at the request of the FDA, we have updated the forms used to obtain consent from patients in ongoing and future trials with tivozanib to include information about the interim OS results from the TIVO-3 trial as well as the other tivozanib clinical trial OS results to date. These results may impact the interest of clinicians and patients in participating in future clinical trials with tivozanib.\nFurther, in the event that clinical trial sites are slowed down or closed to enrollment in our trials due to COVID-19, this could have a material adverse impact on our clinical trial plans and timelines. We may also face difficulties recruiting or retaining patients in our ongoing and planned clinical trials if patients are affected by the virus or are fearful of visiting or traveling to our clinical trial sites because of the outbreak.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials could result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, delay or halt the development of and approval processes for our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to commence sales of and generate revenues from our product candidates, which could cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed.\nWe are conducting, and intend in the future to conduct, clinical trials for certain of our product candidates at sites outside the United States. The FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations and the conduct of trials outside the United States could subject us to additional delays and expense.\nWe are conducting, and intend in the future to conduct, one or more of our clinical trials with one or more trial sites that are located outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of these data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice. The FDA must be able to validate the data from the trial through an onsite inspection if necessary. The trial population must also have a similar profile to the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful, except to the extent the disease being studied does not typically occur in the United States. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will be dependent upon its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of our product candidates.\nIn addition, the conduct of clinical trials outside the United States could have a significant adverse impact on us. Risks inherent in conducting international clinical trials include:\n\u2022\nclinical practice patterns and standards of care that vary widely among countries;\n\u2022\nnon-U.S. regulatory authority requirements that could restrict or limit our ability to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nadministrative burdens of conducting clinical trials under multiple non-U.S. regulatory authority schema;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange fluctuations; and\n\u2022\ndiminished protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nWe may not obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates.\nWe may not obtain marketing approval for our product candidates. It is possible that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies may refuse to accept for substantive review any future application that we or a collaborator may submit to market and sell our product candidates, or that any such agency may conclude after review of our or our collaborator\u2019s data that such application is insufficient to obtain marketing approval of our product candidate. In June 2013, for example, the FDA issued the 2013 CRL informing us that it would not approve tivozanib for the first-line treatment of RCC based solely on the data from the TIVO-1 trial, and recommended that we perform an additional clinical trial adequately sized to assure the FDA that tivozanib does not adversely affect OS. Our TIVO-3 clinical trial was designed to address the FDA\u2019s concerns about the negative OS trend expressed in the 2013 CRL. However, the FDA has informed us that our interim OS results to date have not abrogated its concerns regarding OS. In the FDA\u2019s feedback regarding the August 2019 OS analysis, the FDA recommended that we not submit an NDA for tivozanib at that time. The FDA noted that the TIVO-3 OS results may worsen with final analysis. We intend to conduct a final OS analysis for the TIVO-3 trial in the second quarter of 2020. If the TIVO-3 trial yields a final OS hazard ratio that is above 1.00, or the FDA does not otherwise find the results of the TIVO-3 trial to adequately demonstrate a favorable risk-benefit profile for tivozanib in RCC, then the FDA may not grant marketing approval for tivozanib.\nIf the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory agency does not accept or approve any application to market and sell any of our product candidates, such regulators may require that we conduct additional clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing validation studies and submit that data before they will reconsider our application. Depending on the extent of these or any other required trials or studies, approval of any application that we submit may be delayed by several years, or may require us or our collaborator to expend more resources than we or they have available. It is also possible that additional trials or studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agency to approve our applications for marketing and commercialization.\nAny delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, marketing approvals would prevent us or our collaborators from commercializing our product candidates and generating revenues. If any of these outcomes occur, we would not be eligible for certain milestone and royalty revenue under our partnership agreements, our collaborators could terminate our partnership agreements, and we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for our product candidates, any of which could significantly harm our business.\nEven if a product candidate receives marketing approval, we or others may later discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, which could compromise our ability, or that of any collaborators, to market the product, and could cause regulatory authorities to take certain regulatory actions.\nClinical trials of our product candidates will be conducted in carefully defined subsets of patients who have agreed to participate. Consequently, it is possible that our clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any, or alternatively fail to identify undesirable side effects. If, following approval of a product candidate, we, or others, discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, any of the following adverse events could occur:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product;\n\u2022\nwe, or any of our collaborators, may be required to recall the product, change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u2022\nadditional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the particular product;\n\u2022\nwe, or any of our collaborators, may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u2022\nwe, or any of our collaborators, may be required to create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of the previously unidentified side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022\nphysicians and patients may stop using our product; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could harm our business and operations and could negatively impact our stock price.\nIn August 2017, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to EUSA for tivozanib in all 28 countries of the EU (which included the United Kingdom at that time), Norway and Iceland. Tivozanib is sold under the brand name FOTIVDA and is approved for the first-line treatment of adult patients with RCC and for adult patients who are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-na\u00efve following disease progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for RCC. In January 2019, we were informed by EUSA that the CHMP requested the topline data results from our TIVO-3 trial for review at the CHMP\u2019s January 2019 plenary meeting under its post-authorization monitoring procedures. Subsequently, EUSA has informed us that the CHMP has requested additional data analysis from our TIVO-3 trial. Following its review of these data analyses, the CHMP has determined that the analyses of various factors that may have impacted the first interim OS data from our TIVO-3 trial do not fully explain the discordance between the PFS results (HR=0.73, p=0.02) and the first interim OS results (HR=1.12, p=0.44) in the TIVO-3 trial, and that more mature OS data is required prior to drawing a conclusion. Similar to the FDA, the CHMP accepted the proposal to conduct an additional interim OS analysis in August 2019. The CHMP further provided that regulatory action should be considered if the August 2019 interim OS analysis confirmed a negative trend in OS. Although we provided the updated OS analysis, showing a hazard ratio of 0.99 (p=0.95), which estimates that tivozanib resulted in a 1% lower risk of death for patients in the trial relative to sorafenib, to EUSA in September 2019 for their discussions with the CHMP, we have no assurance as to the position that the CHMP or the EMA may take with respect to the updated OS results of the TIVO-3 trial. If the CHMP or the EMA finds that these results from the TIVO-3 trial raise questions on the safety or efficacy of FOTIVDA and the risk-benefit assessment on which the marketing authorization for FOTIVDA in the EU was based, the EMA could take certain post-authorization measures with regards to FOTIVDA such as requiring EUSA to conduct additional post-authorization studies, or risk management measures as part of an extended pharmacovigilance monitoring, or a change of the labeling and use instructions for FOTIVDA. If its concerns would not be addressed by other post-authorization measures, the EMA or the European Commission could also determine to change, suspend or revoke the previously granted marketing authorization for FOTIVDA. Any such actions taken by the European regulatory authorities with respect to the marketing authorization for FOTIVDA could have a material adverse effect on our ability to receive milestone, royalty or other payments from EUSA related to the approval and/or sales of FOTIVDA and on our business, operations and prospects.\nEven if our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success, in which case we may not generate significant revenues or become profitable.\nWe have never commercialized a product, and even if one of our product candidates is approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. Physicians are often reluctant to switch their patients from existing therapies even when new and potentially more effective or convenient treatments enter the market. Further, patients often acclimate to the therapy that they are currently taking and do not want to switch unless their physicians recommend switching products or they are required to switch therapies due to lack of reimbursement for existing therapies. There are already a number of therapies on the market competitive to tivozanib, as well as our other product candidates, in indications we intend to target.\nEfforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may not be successful. If any of our product candidates is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, we may not generate significant revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety of the product;\n\u2022\nthe advantages of the product compared to competitive therapies;\n\u2022\nthe number of competitors approved for similar uses;\n\u2022\nthe relative promotional effort of us as compared with our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nwhether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-, second- or third-line therapy;\n\u2022\nour ability to offer the product for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nthe product\u2019s convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022\nthe strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of our approved products as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022\npotential product liability claims;\n\u2022\nchanges in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product; and\n\u2022\navailability and amount of coverage and reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third-party payors.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we intend to focus on developing product candidates for specific indications that we identify as most likely to succeed, in terms of their potential for marketing approval and commercialization, as well as those that are most aligned with our strategic goals. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that may prove to have greater commercial potential.\nOur resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to the product candidate.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into sales, marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing any product candidates if approved.\nWe do not have sales, marketing or distribution infrastructure and have limited experience as an organization in the sales, marketing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Our licensee EUSA has been responsible for the sales, marketing, and distribution efforts associated with the commercial launch of tivozanib in certain European countries. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. The development of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities will require substantial resources, will be time consuming and, if not initiated sufficiently in advance of marketing approval, could delay any product launch. Conversely, if the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing and distribution capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we could incur substantial costs and our investment could be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. In addition, we may not be able to hire or retain a sales force in the United States that is sufficient in size or has adequate expertise in the medical markets that we plan to target. If we are unable to establish or retain a sales force and marketing and distribution capabilities, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services such as our collaboration with EUSA, our product revenues or the profitability of these products may be substantially lower than if we were to directly market and sell products in those markets. Furthermore, we may be unsuccessful in entering into the necessary arrangements with third parties or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, we may have little or no control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively.\nWe may seek to enter into collaborations that we believe may contribute to our ability to advance development and ultimately commercialize our product candidates. We also seek to enter into collaborations where we believe that realizing the full commercial value of our development programs will require access to broader geographic markets or the pursuit of broader patient populations or indications. If a potential partner has development or commercialization expertise that we believe is particularly relevant to one of our products, then we may seek to collaborate with that potential partner even if we believe we could otherwise develop and commercialize the product independently.\nIf we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for certain of our therapeutic product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, we may not realize the full commercial potential of these therapeutics.\nA component of our business strategy may be to develop, in collaboration with a third party, companion diagnostics for some of our therapeutic product candidates. There has been limited success to date industry-wide in developing companion diagnostics. To be successful, we or our collaborators will need to address a number of scientific, technical, regulatory and logistical challenges. We have limited experience in the development of diagnostics and may not be successful in developing appropriate diagnostics to pair with any of our therapeutic product candidates. The FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States are generally expected to regulate companion diagnostics as medical devices. In each case, companion diagnostics require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. We expect to rely in part on third parties for the design, development and manufacture of any companion diagnostic. If we, or any third parties that we engage to assist us, are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for our therapeutic product candidates, or experience delays in doing so, the development of our therapeutic product candidates may be adversely affected, our therapeutic product candidates may not receive marketing approval and we may not realize the full commercial potential of any therapeutics that receive marketing approval. As a result, our business would be harmed, possibly materially.\nWe face substantial competition from existing approved products. Our competitors may also discover, develop or commercialize new competing products before, or more successfully, than we do.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive, and our future success depends on our ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the design, development and commercialization of product candidates. Our corporate objective is to design, develop and commercialize new products with superior efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety. We expect any product candidate that we commercialize either independently or with our strategic partners will compete with existing, market-leading products.\nThere are many companies focused on the development of small molecules and antibodies for cancer treatment. Our core competitors include pharmaceutical and biotech organizations, as well as academic research institutions, clinical research laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities in the same therapeutic area. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Additionally, many competitors have greater experience in product discovery and development, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and commercialization capabilities, which may provide them with a competitive advantage.\nWe believe that our ability to compete will depend on our ability to execute on the following objectives:\n\u2022\ndesign, develop and commercialize products that are superior to other products in the market in terms of, among other things, safety, efficacy, convenience, or price;\n\u2022\nobtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our processes and product candidates;\n\u2022\nobtain required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nobtain favorable reimbursement, formulary and guideline status; and\n\u2022\ncollaborate with others in the design, development and commercialization of our products.\nEstablished competitors may invest heavily to discover and develop novel compounds that could make our product candidates obsolete. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in order to obtain approval, to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. If we are not able to compete effectively, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nThe competitive landscape and treatment regimens for RCC and HCC continue to rapidly evolve, particularly given the entrance of immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapies and the potential entrance of immune checkpoint inhibitor and VEGFR TKI combination therapies into the RCC treatment landscape. The utilization of such regimens may affect sequencing of certain drugs and combinations across different lines of therapy. Additionally, there are several therapies in clinical development for RCC and HCC that may alter the competitive landscape for the treatment of these cancers. As such, it is difficult to predict how these changes will inform our perspective on the key competitors of tivozanib in RCC and HCC in the future.\nWe believe the key competitors for tivozanib in relapsed or refractory RCC include the following FDA-approved treatments: Exelixis\u2019 Cabometyx (cabozantinib); Novartis\u2019 Afinitor (everolimus); Pfizer\u2019s Inlyta (axitinib); BMS\u2019s Opdivo (nivolumab); and Bayer\u2019s Nexavar (sorafenib), all as single-agent therapies, along with the combination of Merck\u2019s Lenvima (lenvatinib) and Novartis\u2019 Afinitor (everolimus). In addition, other FDA-approved treatments for advanced RCC in the first line and/or subsequent lines of therapy include the combinations of Merck\u2019s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Pfizer\u2019s Inlyta (axitinib); BMS\u2019s Yervoy (ipilimumab) and Opdivo (nivolumab); and Pfizer\u2019s Inlyta (axitinib) and Merck KGaA\u2019s Bavencio (avelumab) as well as the single agents of Pfizer\u2019s Sutent (sunitinib); Pfizer\u2019s Torisel (temsirolimus); and Novartis\u2019 Votrient (pazopanib). Additionally, there are a number of therapies in clinical development for relapsed or refractory RCC, including Merck\u2019s MK-6482 as a single agent; the combination of\nCalithera Biosciences, Inc.\u2019s CB-938 and Exelixis\u2019 Cabotmetyx (cabozantinib); and the combination of Merck\u2019s PT-2977 and Exelixis\u2019 Cabometyx (cabozantinib).\nWe believe the key competitors for tivozanib in advanced HCC include the following FDA-approved treatments: Bayer\u2019s Nexavar (sorafenib); Bayer\u2019s Stivarga (regorafenib); Eisai\u2019s Lenvima (lenatinib); Exelixis\u2019 Cabometyx (cabozantinib); Eli Lilly\u2019s Cyramza (ramucirumab); BMS\u2019s Opdivo (nivolumab); and Merck\u2019s Keytruda (pembrolizumab), all as single agents; as well as BMS\u2019s Yervoy (ipilimumab) and Opdivo (nivolumab) in combination in the refractory setting. Recently, Roche reported results of its Phase 3 IMBRAVE150 clinical trial evaluating the combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab. If approved, we believe this regimen may become a new standard of care in the first line treatment of HCC if approved. Additionally, there are a number of therapies in clinical development for advanced HCC and it is difficult to predict which will be the key competitors to tivozanib in this indication.\nWe believe the products that are considered competitive with ficlatuzumab include those agents exclusively targeting the HGF/c-Met pathway. We believe the most direct competitors to our AV-203 program are monoclonal antibodies that specifically target the ErbB3 receptor. With respect to AV-380, Megace is the only approved agent for the treatment of cachexia. A number of agents with unique mechanisms of action are in various stages of clinical development in cachexia or muscle wasting. In connection with AV-353, we are not aware of any ongoing clinical trials of Notch 3-specific inhibitors or any approved Notch 3-specific inhibitors in oncology; however, a number of agents for applications in oncology are being explored which target the Notch 3 receptor and may inhibit other Notch receptors.\nEven if we or our collaborators are able to commercialize any product candidate, the product may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party payor reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, any of which could harm our business.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by third-party payors, including government health care programs and private health insurers. For example, our European licensee for tivozanib, EUSA, is currently in the process of seeking reimbursement approval for tivozanib in many of the countries in which tivozanib has been approved. If coverage is not available, or reimbursement is limited, we, or any collaborators, may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us or our collaborators to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investments. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors, and coverage and reimbursement levels for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often time consuming and costly and may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or applied consistently.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. Marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we or our collaborators might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which may negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our or their investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nPatients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Therefore, our ability, and the ability of any collaborators, to commercialize successfully any of our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. The healthcare industry is acutely focused on cost containment, both in the United States and elsewhere. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. These payors may not view our products, even if approved, as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our customers or may not be sufficient to allow our products to be marketed on a competitive basis. Cost-control initiatives could cause us or our collaborators to decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in lower than anticipated product revenues. If the prices for our products, if any, decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide coverage or adequate reimbursement, our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.\nThere may also be delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Reimbursement rates may vary, for example, according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used. Reimbursement rates may also be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services.\nIn addition, increasingly, third-party payors are requiring higher levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies and are challenging the prices charged. Further, the net reimbursement for drug products may be subject to additional reductions if there are changes to laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. An inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval could significantly harm our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense could require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ndelay or termination of our clinical trial;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and negative media attention; and\n\u2022\na decline in our stock price.\nOur inability to maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical studies in the amount of $20 million in the aggregate. We will need to increase our insurance coverage if we commercialize any product that receives marketing approval. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. The cost of any such product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. In addition, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive. If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, it could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties, such as CROs, to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates, and if they do not properly and successfully perform their obligations to us, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nWe, in consultation with our collaborators, where applicable, design the clinical trials for our product candidates, but we rely on CROs and other third parties to perform many of the functions in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out many of these trials. We compete with larger companies for the resources of these third parties.\nAlthough we plan to continue to rely on these third parties to conduct our ongoing and any future clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, including GCPs, for designing, conducting, monitoring, recording, analyzing, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. The third parties on whom we rely generally may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we are required to enter into alternative arrangements because of any such termination, the introduction of our product candidates to market could be delayed.\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their duties under their agreements with us, if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain, process and analyze is compromised for any reason, including their failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or regulatory requirements, or if they otherwise fail to comply with clinical trial protocols or meet expected deadlines, our clinical trials may experience delays or may fail to meet regulatory requirements. If our clinical trials do not meet regulatory requirements or if these third parties need to be replaced, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and our reputation could be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our preclinical and clinical product candidate supplies, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates. Any failure by a third-party manufacturer to produce supplies for us may delay or impair our ability to complete our clinical trials or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe do not possess all of the capabilities to fully commercialize any of our product candidates on our own. We have relied upon third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of such product candidates or to market them.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails certain risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates in accordance with our product specifications), failure of the third party to accept orders for supply of drug substance or drug product and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. Other risks of our reliance on third-party manufacturers include the possible mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or placebo not being properly identified; the possibility of clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug supplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales; and the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale-up manufacturing processes as needed, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the FDA to withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including recall or seizure, fines, imposition of operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production or injunctions.\nWe rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical studies and potential commercial manufacturing. There are a small number of suppliers of raw and starting materials that we use to manufacture our product candidates. Such suppliers may not sell these materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these materials by our manufacturers. In addition, other factors that are hard to predict or beyond our or our manufacturers\u2019 control, such as natural disasters, fires or explosions, political unrest, terrorism, generalized labor unrest, or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our manufacturers\u2019 operations.\nSignificant outbreaks of contagious diseases such as COVID-19, and other adverse public health developments, could have a material impact on our business operations and operating results. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of March 2020, that outbreak has led to numerous confirmed cases worldwide, including in the Unites States and other countries where we are conducting clinical trials or activities in support thereof. In addition to those who have been directly affected, millions more have been affected by governmental efforts around the world to slow the spread of the outbreak. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce. The future progression of the outbreak and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain.\nAny significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical trial or potential commercial launch due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our supply chain is disrupted due to any of these factors after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, there could be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.\nBecause of the complex nature of many of our early stage compounds and product candidates, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture such compounds and product candidates at a cost or quantity or in the timeframe necessary to develop and commercialize the related products. If we successfully commercialize any of our drugs, we may be required to establish or access large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities. In addition, as our drug development pipeline matures, we will have a greater need for commercial manufacturing capacity. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates and we currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing in the event that one or more of our product candidates gains marketing approval, third parties with whom we currently work may need to increase their scale of production or we may need to secure alternate suppliers.\nWe may not be successful in establishing or maintaining strategic partnerships to further the development of our therapeutic programs. Additionally, if any of our current or future strategic partners fails to perform its obligations or terminates the partnership, the development and commercialization of the product candidates under such agreement could be delayed or terminated. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business.\nOur success will depend in significant part on our ability to attract and maintain strategic partners and strategic relationships with major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to support the development and commercialization of our product candidates. In these partnerships, we would expect our strategic partner to provide capabilities in research, development, marketing and sales, in addition to funding.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for any product candidates and programs because our product candidates may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort or third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential.\nIf we are not able to establish and maintain strategic partnerships:\n\u2022\nthe development of certain of our product candidates may be delayed or terminated;\n\u2022\nthe internal cash expenditures needed to develop such product candidates would increase significantly, and we may not have the cash resources to develop such product candidates on our own; and\n\u2022\nwe may have fewer resources with which to continue to operate our business.\nEven if we are successful in our efforts to establish new strategic partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain such strategic partnerships if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed, sales of an approved product are disappointing or the partner experiences its own financial or operational constraints or a change in business strategy. If any current or future strategic partners do not devote sufficient time and resources to their arrangements with us, we may not realize the potential commercial benefits of the arrangement, and our results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, if any strategic partner were to breach or terminate its arrangements with us, the development and commercialization of the affected product candidate could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue development and commercialization of the product candidate on our own. Our current partners and licensees can terminate their agreements with us under various conditions, including without cause, at which point they would no longer continue to develop our products. For example, following a change in strategic priorities, Novartis terminated the Novartis Agreement for our AV-380 program in August 2018 without cause. During the term of the Novartis Agreement, Novartis had been responsible for the costs and development of the AV-380 program worldwide. The transfer of the AV-380 program from Novartis has been completed and the AV-380 drug supply has been returned to us. We initiated preclinical toxicology studies in 2019 to support a potential IND filing with the FDA in the second half of 2020.\nMuch of the potential revenue from any of our strategic partnerships will likely consist of contingent payments, such as development milestones and royalties payable on sales of any successfully developed drugs. Any such contingent revenue will depend upon our, and our strategic partners\u2019, ability to successfully develop, introduce, market and sell new drugs. In some cases, we are not involved in these processes, and we depend entirely on our strategic partners. Any of our strategic partners may fail to develop or effectively commercialize these drugs because it:\n\u2022\ndecides not to devote the necessary resources because of internal constraints, such as limited personnel with the requisite scientific expertise, limited cash resources or specialized equipment limitations, or the belief that other product candidates may have a higher likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval or may potentially generate a greater return on investment;\n\u2022\ndoes not have sufficient resources necessary to carry the product candidate through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization; or\n\u2022\ncannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals.\nIf one or more of our strategic partners fails to develop or effectively commercialize product candidates for any of the foregoing reasons or any other reason, we may not be able to replace the strategic partner with another partner to develop and commercialize a product candidate under the terms of the strategic partnership. We may also be unable to obtain, on terms acceptable to us, a license from such strategic partner to any of its intellectual property that may be necessary or useful for us to continue to develop and commercialize a product candidate. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and our ability to achieve future profitability, and could cause our stock price to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nWe could be unsuccessful in obtaining or maintaining adequate patent protection for one or more of our product candidates, or the scope of our patent protection could be insufficiently broad, which could result in competition and a decrease in the potential market share for our product candidates.\nWe cannot be certain that patents will be issued or granted with respect to applications that are currently pending, or that issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid and/or unenforceable. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is generally uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards applied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. Consequently, patents may not issue from our pending patent applications. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have on our proprietary products and technology. The scope of patent protection that the USPTO will grant with respect to the antibodies in our antibody product pipeline is uncertain. It is possible that the USPTO will not allow broad antibody claims that cover closely related antibodies as well as the specific antibody. Upon receipt of FDA approval, competitors would be free to market antibodies almost identical to ours, including biosimilar antibodies, thereby decreasing our market share.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar non-U.S. legislation to extend the term of patents covering each of our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nPatents have a limited duration. The term of a U.S. patent, if granted from an application filed on or after June 8, 1995, is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patents expire, we may be open to competition from competitive medications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned or in-licensed patent rights may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nDepending upon the circumstances, the term of our owned and in-licensed patent rights that cover our product candidates may be extended in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act, by supplementary perfection certificates, or SPCs, in certain European countries, and by similar legislation in other countries for delays incurred when seeking marketing approval for a drug candidate. For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within the applicable deadline, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be materially reduced.\nThe U.S. patent covering the tivozanib molecule and its therapeutic use is scheduled to expire in 2022. In view of the length of time tivozanib has been under regulatory review at the FDA, however, a patent term extension of up to 5 years may be available, which, if granted, could extend the term of this patent until 2027. However, the length of the extension could be less than we request, or no extension may be granted at all. Currently, SPCs have been granted in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden that extend the term of the corresponding patents that cover the tivozanib molecule in each of those jurisdictions up to 2027. It is possible that our applications for SPCs in other European countries such as Belgium, Denmark, Finland, and Great Britain will be denied. If we are unable to obtain a patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period of time during which the patent rights covering tivozanib or its use can be enforced will be shortened, and our competitors may obtain approval to market a competing product sooner. As a result, our potential revenue from tivozanib could be materially reduced, causing material harm to our business.\nIssued patents covering one or more of our products could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in patent office proceedings, or in court.\nIf we or one of our strategic partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet one or more statutory requirements for patentability, including, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness, lack of written description or non-enablement. In addition, patent validity challenges may, under certain circumstances, be based upon non-statutory obviousness-type double patenting, which, if successful, could result in a finding that the claims are invalid for obviousness-type double patenting or the loss of patent term, including a patent term adjustment granted by the USPTO, if a terminal disclaimer is filed to obviate a finding of obviousness-type double patenting. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Additionally, third parties are able to challenge the validity of issued patents through administrative proceedings in the patent offices of certain countries, including the USPTO and the European Patent Office. Although we have conducted due diligence on patents we have exclusively in-licensed, and we believe that we have conducted our patent prosecution in accordance with the duty of candor and in good faith, the outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one of our products. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nClaims that our platform technologies, our products or the sale or use of our products infringe the patent rights of third parties could result in costly litigation or could require substantial time and money to resolve, even if litigation is avoided.\nWe cannot guarantee that our platform technologies, our products, or the use of our products, do not infringe third-party patents. Third parties might allege that we are infringing their patent rights or that we have misappropriated their trade secrets. Such third parties might resort to litigation against us. The basis of such litigation could be existing patents or patents that issue in the future.\nIt is also possible that we failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000, and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing, which is referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our products or platform technology could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies, our products or the use of our products.\nWith regard to ficlatuzumab, we are aware of two separate families of United States patents and foreign counterparts, with each of the two families being owned by a different third party, that contain broad claims related to anti-HGF antibodies having certain binding properties and their use. In the event that the owner of one or more of these patents were to bring an infringement action against us, we may have to argue that our product, its manufacture or use does not infringe a valid claim of the patent in question. Furthermore, if we were to challenge the validity of any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent. This means that in order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent\u2019s claims. There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity.\nIn order to avoid or settle potential claims with respect to any of the patent rights described above or any other patent rights of third parties, we may choose or be required to seek a license from a third party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our strategic partners were able to obtain a license, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly.\nDefending against claims of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets could be costly and time-consuming, regardless of the outcome. Thus, even if we were to ultimately prevail, or to settle at an early stage, such litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs. In addition, litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on the time and attention of our management team, distracting them from the pursuit of other company business.\nUnfavorable outcomes in an intellectual property litigation could limit our research and development activities and/or our ability to commercialize certain products.\nIf third parties successfully assert intellectual property rights against us, we might be barred from using aspects of our technology platform, or barred from developing and commercializing related products. Prohibitions against using specified technologies, or prohibitions against commercializing specified products, could be imposed by a court or by a settlement agreement between us and a plaintiff. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in defending against allegations of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets, we may be forced to pay substantial damage awards to the plaintiff. There is inevitable uncertainty in any litigation, including intellectual property litigation. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any intellectual property litigation, even if the case against us is weak or flawed. If litigation leads to an outcome unfavorable to us, we may be required to obtain a license from the patent owner in order to continue our research and development programs or our partnerships or to market our product(s). It is possible that the necessary license will not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. This could limit our research and development activities, our ability to commercialize specified products, or both.\nMost of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, in-license needed technology, or enter into strategic partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nIn addition, any future patent litigation, interference or other administrative proceedings will result in additional expense and distraction of our personnel. An adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us or our strategic partners to loss of our proprietary position, expose us to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nAn intellectual property litigation could lead to unfavorable publicity that could harm our reputation and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nDuring the course of any patent litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our products, programs, or intellectual property could be diminished. In such event, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nAV-380 and tivozanib are protected by patents exclusively licensed from other companies or institutions. If the licensors terminate the licenses or fail to maintain or enforce the underlying patents, our competitive position would be harmed and our partnerships could be terminated.\nCertain of our product candidates and out-licensing arrangements depend on patents and/or patent applications owned by other companies or institutions with which we have entered into intellectual property licenses. In particular, we hold exclusive licenses from St. Vincent\u2019s for therapeutic applications that benefit from inhibition or decreased expression or activity of MIC-1, which we refer to as GDF15 and which we use in our AV-380 program, and from KKC for tivozanib. We may enter into additional license agreements as part of the development of our business in the future. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute certain patent applications which we have licensed and on which our business depends or may prosecute them in a manner not in the best interests of our business. Even if patents issue from these applications, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may decide not to pursue litigation against third-party infringers, may fail to prove infringement, or may fail to defend against counterclaims of patent invalidity or unenforceability. In addition, in spite of our best efforts, a licensor could claim that we have materially breached a license agreement and terminate the license, thereby removing our or our licensees\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory approval for and to market any product covered by such license. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended market exclusivity, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, identical products. In addition, the partners to which we have sublicensed certain rights under these licenses, such as EUSA, would likely have grounds for terminating our partnerships if these licenses are terminated or the underlying patents are not maintained or enforced. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our competitive business position and our business prospects.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets, technical know-how, and proprietary information concerning our business strategy in order to protect our competitive position. In the course of our research, development and business activities, we often rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary information. Such confidentiality agreements are used, for example, when we talk to potential strategic partners. In addition, each of our employees is required to sign a confidentiality agreement upon joining our company. We take steps to protect our proprietary information, and we seek to carefully draft our confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary interests. Nevertheless, there can be no guarantee that an employee or an outside party will not make an unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary confidential information. This might happen intentionally or inadvertently. It is possible that a competitor will make use of such information, and that our competitive position will be compromised, in spite of any legal action we might take against persons making such unauthorized disclosures.\nTrade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, or outside scientific collaborators might intentionally or inadvertently disclose our trade secret information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States sometimes are less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nOur research and development strategic partners may have rights to publish data and other information to which we have rights. In addition, we sometimes engage individuals or entities to conduct research relevant to our business. The ability of these individuals or entities to publish or otherwise publicly disclose data and other information generated during the course of their research is subject to certain contractual limitations. These contractual provisions may be insufficient or inadequate to protect our confidential information. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication, or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized.\nWe rely significantly upon information technology, and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively and result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nWe could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of information maintained in the information systems and networks of our company, including personal information of our employees. In addition, outside parties may attempt to penetrate our systems or those of our partners or fraudulently induce our employees or employees of our partners to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data. Like other companies, we may experience threats to our data and systems, including malicious codes and computer viruses, cyber-attacks, or other system failures. Any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations, for us or our partners, could result in a material disruption of our product development programs and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and we could incur significant increases in costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate public disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we may incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates may be delayed. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to provide compensation for any losses associated with such events.\nThe number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. If a material breach of our security or that of our partners occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose business and our reputation and credibility could be damaged. We could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace information systems or networks. Although we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to prevent these events from occurring, and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the development and maintenance of these systems, controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely.\nAdditionally, the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with any European activities.\nIntellectual property rights may not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nOthers may be able to make compounds or antibodies that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u2022\nWe or our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u2022\nWe or our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions.\n\u2022\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights.\n\u2022\nOur pending patent applications might not lead to issued patents.\n\u2022\nIssued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with a competitive advantage; for example, our issued patents may not be broad enough to prevent the commercialization of competitive antibodies that are biosimilar to one or more of our antibody products, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors.\n\u2022\nOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our or our strategic partners\u2019 existing or potential commercial markets.\n\u2022\nWe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\n\u2022\nThe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological complexity and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, several events in the last decade have increased uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future and the value of patents once obtained. Among these, in September 2011, patent reform legislation passed by Congress was signed into law in the United States. The patent law introduced changes including a first-to-file system for determining which inventors may be entitled to receive patents, and post-grant challenges, such as inter-partes review and post-grant review proceedings that allow third parties to challenge newly issued patents. The burden of proof required for challenging a patent in these proceedings is lower than in district court litigation, and patents in the biopharmaceutical industry have been successfully challenged using these new post-grant challenges. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in specified circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in specified situations. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could further weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nEven if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. If we or our collaborators are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, export and import, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States, and by the EMA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third-party CROs to assist us in this process.\nSecuring marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the various regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the relevant regulatory authority. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive, may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. For example, in June 2013, the FDA issued the 2013 CRL informing us that it would not approve tivozanib for the first-line treatment of RCC based solely on the data from the TIVO-1 trial. Further, in January 2019, the FDA recommended that we not submit an NDA for tivozanib at that time as the first interim OS results from the TIVO-3 trial did not allay its concerns about a potential detriment in OS from the TIVO-1 trial. In August 2019, we performed a second prespecified interim OS analysis, which showed an updated OS hazard ratio of 0.99 (p=0.95), estimating that tivozanib resulted in a 1% lower risk of death for patients in the trial relative to sorafenib. Although the TIVO-3 trial met its primary endpoint of improving PFS, if the final OS analysis yields an OS hazard ratio above 1.00, or the FDA does not otherwise find the results of the TIVO-3 trial to adequately demonstrate a favorable risk-benefit profile for tivozanib in RCC, we may not be able to obtain marketing approval from the FDA to successfully commercialize tivozanib in the United States.\nIn addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we or our collaborators ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nAccordingly, if we or our collaborators experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed in such jurisdictions. In order to market and sell our medicines in the EU and many other jurisdictions, we or our collaborators must obtain marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, a product must be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We or our collaborators may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any particular market.\nAdditionally, on June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Following protracted negotiations, the United Kingdom left the EU on January 31, 2020. Under the withdrawal agreement, there is a transitional period until December 31, 2020 (extendable up to two years). Discussions between the United Kingdom and the EU have so far mainly focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements but have been extremely difficult to date. To date, only an outline of a trade agreement has been reached. Much remains open but the Prime Minister has indicated that the United Kingdom will not seek to extend the transitional period beyond the end of 2020. If no trade agreement has been reached before the end of the transitional period, there may be significant market and economic disruption. The Prime Minister has also indicated that the United Kingdom will not accept high regulatory alignment with the EU.\nSince the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime that applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and/or the EU for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nSince a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the approval of our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the EU. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the United Kingdom and/or the EU and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and/or the EU for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug designation or orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates, and, even if we do, that exclusivity may not prevent the FDA or the EMA from approving other competing products.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs and biologics for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. We or our collaborators may seek orphan drug designations for other product candidates and may be unable to obtain such designations.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for that candidate. Generally, a product with orphan drug designation only becomes entitled to orphan drug exclusivity if it receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, in which case the FDA or the EMA will be precluded from approving another marketing application for the same product for that indication for the applicable exclusivity period. The applicable exclusivity period is seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different products can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug or biologic for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later product is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, to be more effective or to make a major contribution to patient care.\nOn August 3, 2017, Congress passed the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA. FDARA, among other things, codified the FDA\u2019s pre-existing regulatory interpretation, to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate the clinical superiority of an orphan drug that is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously requires that the FDA recognize the orphan exclusivity period regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. The FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.\nEven if we or our collaborators obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nOnce marketing approval has been granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation. We and our collaborators must therefore comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription products are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we will not be able to promote any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved.\nIn addition, manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We and our collaborators and our contract manufacturers could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMPs.\nAccordingly, were we to receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we would continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control.\nIf we and our collaborators are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Further, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAny product candidate for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to substantial penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control and manufacturing, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the medicine, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.\nThe FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and DOJ impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription products may lead to investigations and enforcement actions alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on distribution or use of a product;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nrecall of products;\n\u2022\ndamage to relationships with collaborators;\n\u2022\nunfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure;\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u2022\nlitigation involving patients using our products.\nNon-compliance with EU requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the EU\u2019s requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nThe efforts of the Trump Administration to pursue regulatory reform may limit the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, and that could negatively impact our business.\nThe Trump Administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of executive orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications.\nFor example, on January 30, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order, applicable to all executive agencies, including the FDA, that required that for each notice of proposed rulemaking or final regulation to be issued in fiscal year 2017, the agency shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed, unless prohibited by law. These requirements are referred to as the \u201ctwo-for-one\u201d provisions. This executive order includes a budget neutrality provision that required the total incremental cost of all new regulations in the 2017 fiscal year, including repealed regulations, to be no greater than zero, except in limited circumstances. For fiscal years 2018 and beyond, the executive order requires agencies to identify regulations to offset any incremental cost of a new regulation. In interim guidance issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and on February 2, 2017, the Trump Administration indicated that the \u201ctwo-for-one\u201d provisions may apply not only to agency regulations, but also to significant agency guidance documents. In addition, on February 24, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing each affected agency to designate an agency official as a \u201cRegulatory Reform Officer\u201d and establish a \u201cRegulatory Reform Task Force\u201d to implement the two-for-one provisions and other previously issued executive orders relating to the review of federal regulations. However, it is difficult to predict how these requirements will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA\u2019s ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose constraints on FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which, in the event of a violation, could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties, currently set at $11,181 to $22,363 per false claim;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered products to annually report to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, (i) payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and (ii) certain physician ownership or investment interests; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency statutes, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by third-party payors, including private insurers.\nSome state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to other healthcare providers and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, integrity obligations, exclusion from funded healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any such penalties could adversely affect our financial results. We are developing and implementing a corporate compliance program designed to ensure that we will market and sell any future products that we successfully develop from our product candidates in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot guarantee that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, integrity obligations, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from government funded healthcare programs.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain.\nIn the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA. Among the provisions of the ACA of potential importance to our business and our product candidates are the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription products and biologic agents;\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u2022\na new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u2022\nexpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand products to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient products to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\nnew requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;\n\u2022\na new requirement to annually report product samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u2022\na new Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription products; and\n\u2022\nestablished the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.\nSince enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d The Congress may consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA during the next Congressional session.\nThe Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. One such executive order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. A second executive order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General have filed suit to stop the Trump Administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. On June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. This decision is under review by the U.S. Supreme Court during its current term. The full effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known.\nIn addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. On November 30, 2018, CMS announced a proposed rule that would amend the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs. Among other things, the proposed rule changes would allow Medicare Advantage plans to use pre authorization (PA) and step therapy (ST) for six protected classes of drugs, with certain exceptions, permit plans to implement PA and ST in Medicare Part B drugs; and change the definition of \u201cnegotiated prices\u201d while a definition of \u201cprice concession\u201d in the regulations. It is unclear whether these proposed changes we be accepted, and if so, what effect such changes will have on our business. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business.\nWhile Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise.\nOn December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Trump Administration and CMS have both stated\nthat the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the same judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. The Trump Administration thereafter represented to the Court of Appeals considering this judgment that it does not oppose the lower court's ruling. On July 10, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard oral argument in this case. In those arguments, the Trump Administration argued in support of upholding the lower court decision. On December 18, 2019, that court affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is unconstitutional and it remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration of the severability question and additional analysis of the provisions of the ACA. On January 21, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review this decision on an expedited basis. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.\nThe costs of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States, and members of Congress and the Trump Administration have stated that they will address such costs through new legislative and administrative measures. To date, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the federal level, the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2020 budget process or in other future legislation. In addition, on December 23, 2019, the Trump Administration published a proposed rulemaking that, if finalized, would allow states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and approval. Applicants would be required to demonstrate that their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost savings for consumers. At the same time, the FDA issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products).\nIn addition, CMS has proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. On November 30, 2018, CMS announced a proposed rule that would amend the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs. Among other things, the proposed rule changes would allow Medicare Advantage plans to use pre-authorization and step therapy for six protected classes of drugs, with certain exceptions, permit plans to implement pre-authorization and step therapy in Medicare Part B drugs; and change the definition of \u201cnegotiated prices\u201d while a definition of \u201cprice concession\u201d in the regulations. It is unclear whether these proposed changes we be accepted, and if so, what effect such changes will have on our business.\nAt the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nLaws and regulations governing any international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain products outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nIf we expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nWe maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any.\nIn some countries, such as the countries of the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control and access. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies could prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may prolong the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Potential Growth\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management, we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management, as well as others on our management team. The loss of services of employees, and in particular, of a member of management could delay or prevent our ability to successfully maintain or enter into new licensing arrangements or collaborations, the successful development of our product candidates, the completion of our planned clinical trials or the commercialization of our product candidates. We do not carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance covering any members of our senior management. Our employment arrangements with all of these individuals are \u201cat will,\u201d meaning they or we can terminate their service at any time.\nWe face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and other research institutions, many of which have substantially greater resources with which to reward qualified individuals than we do. We may face challenges in retaining our existing senior management and key employees and recruiting new employees to join our company as our business needs change. We may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals, and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our future business plans.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state health-care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nIn addition, during the course of our operations, our directors, executives and employees may have access to material, nonpublic information regarding our business, our results of operations or potential transactions we are considering. Despite the adoption of an insider trading policy, we may not be able to prevent a director, executive or employee from trading in our common stock on the basis of, or while having access to, material, nonpublic information. If a director, executive or employee was to be investigated, or an action was to be brought against a director, executive or employee for insider trading, it could have a negative impact on our reputation and our stock price. Such a claim, with or without merit, could also result in substantial expenditures of time and money, and divert attention of our management team from other tasks important to the success of our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf we fail to meet the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which would decrease the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur common stock is currently listed for quotation on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We are required to meet specified requirements to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, including, among other things, a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. On March 18, 2019, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until September 16, 2019, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. We did not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement as of September 16, 2019.\nOn September 17, 2019, we were provided an additional period of 180 calendar days, or until March 16, 2020, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If, at any time before March 16, 2020, the bid price for our common stock closes at $1.00 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, we may be eligible to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. Under certain circumstances, Nasdaq could require that the bid price exceed $1.00 for more than ten consecutive trading days before determining that we comply with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards.\nOn February 19, 2020, we effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of our common stock seeking to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards. As a result of the reverse stock split, the split-adjusted per share market price of our common stock increased and, from February 20, 2020 to March 4, 2020 (10 consecutive business days), the closing bid price of our common stock exceeded $1.00 per share. Accordingly, on March 5, 2020, we received a notice from Nasdaq indicating that we have regained compliance with Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) as of such date.\nAlthough we currently comply with the minimum bid requirement following the reverse stock split, our bid price could fall below $1.00 per share again in the future, in which event we would receive another deficiency notice from Nasdaq advising us that we have 180 days to regain compliance by maintaining a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. Under certain circumstances, Nasdaq could require that the minimum bid price exceed $1.00 for more than ten consecutive days before determining that a company complies. If we fail to satisfy the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s continued listing requirements, we may transfer to the OTC Bulletin Board. Having our common stock trade on the OTC Bulletin Board could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock. Any such transfer could make it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock, and there also would likely be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. We may also face other material adverse consequences in such event, such as negative publicity, a decreased ability to obtain additional financing, diminished investor and/or employee confidence, and the loss of business development opportunities, any of which may contribute to a further decline in our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to be, highly volatile, and could fall below the price you paid. A significant decline in the value of our stock price could also result in securities class-action litigation against us.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nnew products, product candidates or new uses for existing products introduced or announced by our strategic partners, or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated results from and any delays in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe results of regulatory reviews and other regulatory correspondence relating to our product candidates or our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe results of our efforts to develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us of material developments in our business, financial condition and/or operations;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures and capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies; and\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, as well as the overall trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market for biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nPeriods of volatility in the market for a company\u2019s stock are often followed by litigation against the company. For example, following our May 2, 2013 announcement regarding the ODAC vote, we and certain of our former officers and directors were involved in several legal proceedings. Currently, we, our directors, certain of our current and former officers are involved in several lawsuits following our announcements related to the TIVO-3 trial data. See Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d These proceedings, and other litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe and our collaborators may not achieve development and commercialization goals in the estimated time frames that we publicly announce, which could have an adverse impact on our business and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe set goals, and make public statements regarding our expected timing for certain accomplishments, such as statements we have made about the initiation and completion of clinical trials, filing and approval of regulatory applications and other developments and milestones under our research and development programs and those of our partners and collaborators for tivozanib, ficlatuzumab, AV-203, AV-380 and AV-353. The actual timing of these events can vary significantly due to a number of factors, including, without limitation, delays or failures in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, insufficient data or unsatisfactory results from trials, the amount of time, effort and resources committed to our programs and the uncertainties inherent in the regulatory approval process. As a result, there can be no assurance that our preclinical studies and clinical trials will advance or be completed in the time frames we expect or announce, that we will make regulatory submissions or receive regulatory approvals as planned or that we will be able to adhere to our currently anticipated schedule for the achievement of key milestones under any of our programs. If we fail to achieve one or more of the events described above as planned, our business could be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock could decline.\nOur management has broad discretion over our use of available cash and cash equivalents and might not spend our available cash and cash equivalents in ways that increase the value of your investment.\nOur management has broad discretion on where and how to use our cash and cash equivalents and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of our available cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations. Our management might not apply our cash and cash equivalents in ways that increase the value of your investment. We expect to use a substantial portion of our cash to fund existing and future research and development of our preclinical and clinical product candidates, with the balance, if any, to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may in the future include investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, partnerships, services or technologies. Our management might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of this cash. You will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use our cash reserves.\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. Some of the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate on a period-to-period basis include:\n\u2022\nthe status of our clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nthe level of expenses incurred in connection with our clinical development programs, including development and manufacturing costs relating to our clinical development candidates;\n\u2022\nthe implementation of restructuring and cost-savings strategies;\n\u2022\nthe implementation or termination of collaboration, licensing, manufacturing or other material agreements with third parties, and non-recurring revenue or expenses under any such agreement;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with lawsuits against us or other litigation in which we may become involved, including the current lawsuits described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under \u201cPart I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d;\n\u2022\nchanges in our 2017 Loan Agreement with Hercules, including the existence of any event of default that may accelerate then remaining principal payments and fees due thereunder;\n\u2022\nnon-cash changes in fair value related to re-valuations of our outstanding warrant liability as a result of fluctuations in our stock price; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements.\nPeriod-to-period comparisons of our historical and future financial results may not be meaningful, and investors should not rely on them as an indication of future performance. Our fluctuating results may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. Our failure to meet these expectations may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price.\nAs widely reported, global credit and financial markets have been experiencing extreme volatility, and in some cases, disruptions, over the past several years. Although certain of these trends have recently showed signs of reversing, there can be no assurance that rapid or extended periods of deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by external economic conditions and a volatile business environment or unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the equity and credit markets are not favorable at any time we seek to raise capital, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon clinical development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers or other partners may not survive economically turbulent times, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had approximately $47.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, consisting of cash on deposit with banks, a U.S. government money market fund and high-grade debt securities, including commercial paper. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any downgrades, material losses, or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or marketable securities. However, no assurance can be given that deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives. Dislocations in the credit market may adversely impact the value and/or liquidity of cash equivalents and marketable securities owned by us.\nThere is a possibility that our stock price may decline because of volatility of the stock market and general economic conditions.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of currently outstanding options and warrants, could negatively affect our stock price.\nA substantial portion of our outstanding common stock can be traded without restriction at any time. Some of these shares are currently restricted as a result of securities laws, but will be able to be sold, subject to any applicable volume limitations under federal securities laws with respect to affiliate sales, in the near future. As such, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell such shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, we have a significant number of shares that are subject to outstanding options and warrants. The exercise of these options or warrants and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock could cause a further decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us, or provide favorable coverage. A lack of research coverage may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. To the extent we do have analyst coverage, if one or more analysts downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price would likely decline. In addition, if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nA decline in our stock price may affect future fundraising efforts.\nWe currently have no product revenues, and depend entirely on funds raised through other sources. One source of such funding is future debt and/or equity offerings. Our ability to raise funds in this manner depends upon, among other things, our stock price, which may be affected by capital market forces, evaluation of our stock by securities analysts, product development success (or failure), and internal management operations and controls.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws or Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a rights plan, or a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that a stockholder could receive a premium for shares of our common stock held by a stockholder in an acquisition.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\nProxy contests have been waged against companies in the biopharmaceutical industry over the last few years. If faced with a proxy contest, we may not be able to successfully respond to the contest, which would be disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our business could be adversely affected by a proxy contest because:\n\u2022\nresponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders may be costly and time-consuming, and may disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to the potential outcome of any proxy contest may result in our inability to consummate potential acquisitions, collaborations or in-licensing opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and\n\u2022\nif individuals that have a specific agenda different from that of our management or other members of our board of directors are elected to our board as a result of any proxy contest, such an election may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce accurate financial statements and on our stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us, on an annual basis, to review and evaluate our internal controls, and requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls. Despite our efforts, we can provide no assurance as to our, or our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s, conclusions with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. There is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nIf we are unable to successfully remediate any material weaknesses in our internal control, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline as a result. We also could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nOur stockholders should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing operations. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends is currently prohibited by the terms of our debt financing arrangements and any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. As a result, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nWe might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $527.1 million, of which $502.6 million will, if not used, expire at various dates through 2037, and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $11.3 million, which will, if not used, expire at various dates through 2039. To the extent that they expire unused, these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will not be available to offset our future income tax liabilities. Federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such carryforwards is limited to 80% of our taxable income in the year in which such carryforwards are used.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss and credit carryforwards to reduce its tax liability for post-change periods may be limited. We have not determined if we have experienced Section 382 ownership changes in the past and if a portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. We also may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. In addition, we have not conducted a detailed study to document whether our historical activities qualify to support the research and development credits currently claimed as a carryforward. A detailed study could result in adjustment to our research and development credit carryforwards. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, or if our research and development carryforwards are adjusted, our use of those attributes to offset future income tax liabilities would be limited.", "PERMNO": 93301, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AVEO"}
