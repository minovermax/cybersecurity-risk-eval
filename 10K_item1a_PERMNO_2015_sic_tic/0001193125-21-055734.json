{"cik": "1286681", "company": "DOMINOS PIZZA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nFor a business as large and globally diverse as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the SEC, we believe the most significant risk factors affecting our business include the following:\nBusiness, Operational and Industry Risks\nThe quick service restaurant pizza category and the food service and food delivery markets in general are highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn the U.S., we compete primarily against regional and local companies as well as national chains Pizza Hut\u00ae\n, Papa John\u2019s\u00ae\nand Little Caesars Pizza\u00ae\n. Internationally, we compete primarily with Pizza Hut\u00ae\n, Papa John\u2019s\u00ae\nand country-specific national and local companies. We could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the delivery and carryout pizza category that could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share. Additionally, we face growing competition from the supermarket industry and meal kit and food delivery providers, with the improvement of prepared food and meal kit offerings, expansion in meal delivery platforms and services and the trend towards convergence in grocery, deli, retail and restaurant services.\nWe also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international, national, regional and local restaurants. Competition from order and delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years and order and delivery aggregators have continued to grow in size and scale. The overall food service market, food delivery market and the quick service restaurant market are intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price, service, image, convenience and concept, and are often affected by changes in:\n\u2022\nconsumer tastes;\n\u2022\ninternational, national, regional or local economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndisposable purchasing power;\n\u2022\nmarketing, advertising and pricing, including discounting;\n\u2022\ndemographic trends; and\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations related to international operations.\nWe compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant market not only for customers, but also for management and hourly employees, including store team members, drivers and qualified franchisees, as well as suitable real estate sites. Our supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers. While substantially all U.S. franchisees purchased food, equipment and supplies from us in 2020, U.S. franchisees are not required to purchase food, equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers. If other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and, as a result, our franchisees chose not to purchase from our U.S. supply chain centers, our financial condition, business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced margins, loss of management or hourly employees, disruption in our supply chain centers, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWorldwide economic activity has been and is expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19\npandemic, the scale and scope of which is ultimately unknown, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe global COVID-19\npandemic continues to impact worldwide economic activity. A public health pandemic such as COVID-19\nposes the risk that we and/or our employees, franchisees, supply chain centers, suppliers, customers and other partners may be, or may continue to be, prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing requirements, stay at home orders and advisories and other restrictions that have been or may be suggested or mandated by governmental authorities, or due to the impact of the disease itself on a business\u2019 workforces. In addition, COVID-19\nmay impact the willingness of customers to purchase food prepared outside of the home. The COVID-19\npandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described throughout this report, including but not limited to those relating to our growth strategy, our supply chain and increased food and labor costs, disruption in operations, loss of key employees, our indebtedness, general economic conditions and our international operations.\nIn response to governmental requirements, we and our franchisees have implemented a number of measures, including, among others, temporarily closing certain of our stores, modifying certain stores\u2019 hours and closing locations to in-store\ndining, and we continue to monitor additional developments. We have also made additional operating changes in response to changes in consumer behavior and preferences resulting from COVID-19,\nincluding offering contactless delivery and carryout options to our customers. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that COVID-19\ncould have on our business going forward, the continued spread of the virus and the measures taken in response have disrupted our operations and could disrupt our supply chain, including our access to face coverings for use in our operations, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19\npandemic and mitigation measures have also had an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The Company\u2019s sales and operating results may be affected by uncertain or changing economic and market conditions arising in connection with and in response to the COVID-19\npandemic, including inflation, deflation, prolonged weak consumer demand, political instability or other changes. While the Company has seen an increase in sales in certain markets, including within the U.S., during the COVID-19\npandemic, including increased sales related to heightened reliance on delivery and carry-out\nbusinesses, future sales are not possible to estimate and it is unclear whether and to what extent sales will return to more normalized levels if and when consumer behavior and general economic and business activity return to pre-pandemic\nlevels. The significance of the operational and financial impact to the Company will depend on how long and widespread the disruptions caused by COVID-19,\nand the corresponding response to contain the virus and treat those affected by it, prove to be.\nIf we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes opening new U.S. and international stores, our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected.\nA significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new U.S. (both Company-owned as well as franchised stores) and international franchised stores. We and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores, including, among others:\n\u2022\nconstruction, permitting or development delays relating to the COVID-19\npandemic;\n\u2022\navailability of financing with acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nselection and availability of suitable new store sites and the ability to renew leases in quality locations;\n\u2022\nnegotiation of acceptable lease or financing terms;\n\u2022\nsecuring required U.S. or foreign governmental permits, licenses and approvals;\n\u2022\nemployment and training of qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and business conditions.\nThe opening of additional franchise stores also depends, in part, upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria. Our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income. Additionally, our growth strategy and the success of new stores depend in large part on the availability of suitable store sites. If we and our franchisees are not able to secure leases in desired locations on favorable terms, or to renew such leases, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe and our franchisees are currently planning to expand our U.S. and international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in select new markets. This may require considerable management time as well as start-up\nexpenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated. Operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. In addition, we expect to continue our strategy of building additional stores in markets and regions where we have existing stores, a strategy we refer to as \u201cfortressing,\u201d which may negatively impact sales at existing stores. Therefore, as we continue to expand, we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect, our results of operations may be negatively impacted, and our common stock price may decline. Additionally, we have an equity investment in Dash Brands Ltd. (\u201cDash Brands\u201d), as further discussed elsewhere in this report. Through its subsidiaries, Dash Brands serves as the Company\u2019s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino\u2019s Pizza stores in that market. These types of investments are inherently risky. If Dash Brands does not succeed or is unable to successfully execute its growth strategy, we may be forced to record impairment charges and could lose some or all of our investment.\nWe may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business. If we are able to identify acquisition candidates, such acquisitions may be financed, to the extent permitted under our debt agreements, with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities.\nThe food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions. Changes in these preferences and perceptions may reduce the demand for our products, which would reduce sales and harm our business.\nFood service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes, international, national, regional and local economic conditions, marketing, advertising, pricing, including discounting, and demographic trends. For instance, if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as healthier, our business and operating results would be harmed. Moreover, because we are primarily dependent on a single product, if consumer demand for pizza should decrease, our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu, as many other food service businesses do. The preferences of customers also may change as a result of advances in technology or alternative delivery methods or channels. If we are not able to respond to these changes, or our competitors respond to these changes more effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nReports of food-borne illness or food tampering could reduce sales and harm our business.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as E. coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the quick service restaurant market and could in the future as well. The potential for acts of terrorism affecting our global food supply also exists and, if such an event occurs, could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits. In addition, our reputation is an important asset; as a result, anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits. Media reports of illnesses and injuries, whether accurate or not, could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores. Moreover, as described above, social media has dramatically increased the rate at which negative publicity, including as it relates to food-borne illness, can be disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to respond to or address an issue. Even reports of food-borne illnesses or food tampering occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could, by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry in general, adversely affect us on a local, regional, national or international basis. Further, the occurrence of a widespread illness, health epidemic or pandemic, such as COVID-19,\nor other general health concern could adversely affect us on a local, regional or international basis. A decrease in global retail sales as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of the closure of any Domino\u2019s stores could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with certain of our suppliers, and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver.\nWe do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with certain of our suppliers. Although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers, our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements, including those that may result from increases in volume, in a timely fashion or at all. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our supply chain centers to deliver necessary products to our stores and on our results of operations.\nShortages, interruptions or disruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our specifications. In addition, we have single suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for certain of our ingredients, including pizza cheese and meat toppings. While we believe there are adequate reserve quantities and potential alternative suppliers, shortages, interruptions or disruptions in the supply of food products caused by increased demand, capacity constraints, problems in production or distribution, product recalls, financial or other difficulties of suppliers, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients. We have in the past experienced disruptions within our supply chain resulting from, among other things, capacity, volume, staffing, operational and COVID-19-related\nchallenges and may experience such supply chain disruptions again in the future, which could adversely affect our business and operational results. Additionally, the effects of climate change could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations and could adversely affect our operating results.\nIncreases in food, labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.\nAn increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability and other operating results. Factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee health and benefit costs, increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs. Most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and, in many cases, we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees. Most ingredients used in our pizza, particularly cheese, are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality, weather, demand and other factors. For example, we have experienced increased volatility in prices for some ingredients during the COVID-19\npandemic, which may continue even if the pandemic recedes. Cheese is a significant cost to us, representing approximately 25% of the market basket purchased by our Company-owned stores.\nAdditionally, while we strive to engage in a competitive bidding process for our ingredients, because certain of these ingredients, including meat products, may only be available from a limited number of vendors, we may not always be able to do so effectively. Furthermore, if we need to seek new suppliers, we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable to us than those reflected in our current supply arrangements. Labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and, generally, are also a function of the availability of labor. Several jurisdictions in which we operate have recently approved minimum wage increases. Federal, state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters could, to the extent implemented, materially increase our labor and other costs. As more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases, we expect our labor costs will continue to increase. The advent of legislation aimed at predictive scheduling could impact labor for our stores and our franchisees\u2019 stores. Additionally, while we do not currently have any unionized employees, if a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized, our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other union requirements that increase our costs, disrupt our business, reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture. Labor costs and food costs, including cheese, generally represent approximately 50% to 60% of the sales at a typical Company-owned store.\nAny prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business.\nWe operate 21 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the U.S., two thin crust manufacturing facilities and one vegetable processing center in the U.S. and five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in Canada. We plan to continue investing in additional supply chain capacity in the future.\nOur U.S. dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our Company-owned and U.S. franchise stores. As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to technical, operational or labor difficulties, destruction or damage to the facility, real estate issues, limited capacity or other reasons, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business.\nThe use of social media platforms, including blogs, chat platforms, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other persons, including to our customers and the general public, and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other brand-damaging behaviors. Negative publicity related to our food products or stores or negative publicity related to actions by our executives, team members or franchisees and their team members could harm our business, brand, reputation, marketing partners, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the accuracy of such negative publicity. Failure to use or respond to social media campaigns effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue.\nIn addition, a failure of us, our employees, our franchisees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of social media could adversely impact our brand, reputation, marketing partners, financial condition, and results of operations or subject us or our franchisees to fines or other penalties. Other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information.\nOur success depends in part upon effective advertising, and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the Domino\u2019s Pizza brand.\nWe have been routinely named a Leading National Advertiser by Advertising Age\nand our success depends in part on continued effective advertising. Each Domino\u2019s store located in the U.S. is obligated to contribute 6% of its sales (subject, in certain instances, to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers) to DNAF, which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local market-level advertising. We currently anticipate that this 6% contribution rate will remain in place for the foreseeable future. While additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us, our franchisees and other third parties, none of these additional funds are legally required. The lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results.\nLoss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.\nOur success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Richard E. Allison Jr. and Russell J. Weiner, each of these executives may terminate his agreement on ninety days\u2019 notice. Our other executive officers may terminate their employment pursuant to their employment agreements at any time. As a result, we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management. While we do not have long-term employment agreements with our executive officers, for all of our executive officers we have non-compete\nand non-solicitation\nagreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer\u2019s employment. Our success will also continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores, dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations. The loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risk. Such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.\nWe conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the U.S. Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political, economic or other factors. These factors, over which neither we nor our franchisees have control, may include:\n\u2022\nrecessionary or expansive trends in international markets;\n\u2022\nchanging labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations;\n\u2022\nincreases in the taxes we pay and other changes in applicable tax laws both in the U.S. and globally;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers;\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory changes, and the burdens and costs of our compliance with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022\nchanges in inflation rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in exchange rates and the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in collecting our royalties and longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\nexpropriation of private enterprises;\n\u2022\nthe inherent risk of doing business in China resulting from our equity investment in Dash Brands;\n\u2022\nincreases in anti-American sentiment and the identification of the Domino\u2019s Pizza\nbrand as an American brand;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and uncertainty around the world, including uncertainty arising from the COVID-19\npandemic; and\n\u2022\nother external factors.\nOur earnings and business growth strategy depend on the success of our franchisees, and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees, or employees of our franchisees, that are outside of our control.\nA significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties and fees generated by our franchise stores. Franchisees are independent operators, and their employees are not our employees. We provide tools that franchisees can consider using in training their employees, but the quality of franchise store operations and our brand and branded products may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Consequently, franchisees may not operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or they or their employees may take other actions that adversely affect the value of our brand. In such event, our business and reputation may suffer, and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline.\nWhile we try to ensure that franchisees maintain the quality of the Domino\u2019s brand and branded products and comply with their franchise agreements, franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation or that are inconsistent with their contractual obligations. Although our franchise arrangements permit the applicable franchisor to terminate a franchise agreement under certain circumstances, including the failure by franchisees to uphold quality standards, there can be no assurance that such remedy will be available or sufficient to prevent harm to our brand and protect our intellectual property.\nAs of January 3, 2021, we had 762 U.S. franchisees operating 5,992 U.S. stores. As of that same date, 19 of these franchisees each owned and operated more than 50 U.S. stores, including our largest U.S. franchisee who owned and operated 178 stores and the average U.S. franchisee owned and operated approximately seven stores.\nOur international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our U.S. franchisees. As a result, our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our U.S. operations. As of January 3, 2021, our largest international master franchisee operated 2,797 stores in nine markets, which accounted for approximately 25% of our total international store count. Our U.S. and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully. If one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business.\nWe depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks in order to capitalize on our name recognition, increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both U.S. and international markets. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and they may never be registered in all of these countries. Some countries\u2019 laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all, or make them more difficult to enforce, and third parties may have filed for \u201cDomino\u2019s\u201d or similar marks in countries where Domino\u2019s has not registered its brand. Accordingly, we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks everywhere in the world and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition.\nAll of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and in foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.\nWe may, from time to time, be required to institute or defend litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights, or to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights.\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information, or damage to our employee and business relationships, any of which could subject us to loss and harm our brand.\nA cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers, franchisees, suppliers or employees. A number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. We could also be subject to negative impacts to our business caused by cyber incidents relating to our third-party service providers.\nThe three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationships with customers, franchisees and employees and private data exposure, including payment card or other financial data. In addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, we have also implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks. However, our cyber insurance coverage may not fully cover all of the costs associated with a cyber incident and these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our reputation and financial results will not be materially and adversely affected by such an incident.\nOur and our franchisees\u2019 operations depend upon our ability and the ability of franchisees and third-party service providers (as well as franchisees\u2019 third-party service providers), to protect computer equipment and systems against damage from theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure and other catastrophic or unanticipated events, as well as internal and external security incidents, viruses, denial-of-service\nattacks, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks and other intentional or unintentional disruptions. A significant portion of our retail sales depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems, including but not limited to Domino\u2019s PULSE\u2122\n, our online and mobile ordering platforms and our credit card processing systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, stemming from maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, a compromise in our security or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions to or delays in our and our franchisees\u2019 operations. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our system\u2019s disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in service. In addition, the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain and upgrade our systems, errors or vulnerabilities in our systems, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services and non-compliance\nwith certain laws or regulations, which could reduce our sales, revenues and profits and damage our business and brand. Furthermore, as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, certain of our employees have been required to work from home. The significant increase in remote working, particularly for an extended period of time, could exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased risk of cyber incidents and improper dissemination of personal or confidential information.\nBecause we and our franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers, our business requires the collection and retention of customer data, including sensitive financial data and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide payment processing. A weakness in such third party\u2019s systems or software products may provide a mechanism for a cyber threat. In recent years, a significant number of companies have experienced security data breaches in which customer information was stolen through vendor access channels. While we select our third-party suppliers carefully, cyber-attacks and security data breaches at a payment processing contractor could compromise confidential information or adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. These problems could negatively affect our results of operations, and remediation could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.\nWe also maintain important internal Company data, such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations. In addition, more than half of all global retail sales in 2020 were derived from digital channels, primarily through our online ordering website and mobile applications, where customers enter personally identifiable information that we retain. Our use and retention of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign, federal and state laws and regulations, as well as by certain third-party agreements. For example, the European Union adopted a new regulation that became effective in May 2018, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, and the State of California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act that became effective on January 1, 2020, both of which require companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations. If our security and information systems are compromised or if we, our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, or to successfully implement appropriate processes related to applicable requirements, laws and regulations governing cyber incidents could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, and could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and cash flows, increased fees payable to third parties and fines, penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations. Any other material disruption or other adverse event affecting one or more of our digital ordering platforms, including, for instance, power loss, technological failures, user error or cyber-attacks, could similarly result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and cash flows and other costs, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the impact that new or improved technologies, alternative methods of delivery, including autonomous vehicle delivery, or changes in consumer behavior facilitated by these technologies and alternative methods of delivery will have on our business.\nAdvances in technologies or alternative methods of delivery, including advances in digital ordering technology, or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery could have a negative effect on our business and market position. Moreover, technology and consumer offerings continue to develop, and we expect that new or enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future. We may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable customer proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model. However, we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these delivery channels or their impact on our business.\nIn addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources (financial or otherwise) than we do, may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of alternative methods of delivery, which could harm our competitive position. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences, including with respect to new technologies and alternative methods of delivery, or to effectively adjust our product mix, service offerings, and marketing and merchandising initiatives for products and services that address, and anticipate advances in, technology and market trends. If we are not able to successfully respond to these challenges, our business, market share, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to a variety of additional risks associated with our franchisees.\nOur franchise system subjects us to a number of additional risks, any one of which may impact our ability to collect royalty payments and fees from our franchisees, may harm the goodwill associated with our brand, and/or may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Such risks may also apply to us as owners of stores. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthose relating to the application of local, state, federal and foreign bankruptcy laws and other applicable laws governing creditors\u2019 rights generally and the impact such laws could have on our ability to collect payments and fees under applicable franchise agreements;\n\u2022\nthose relating to franchisees that are operating entities, which generally are not limited-purpose entities, including business, credit, financial and other risks in addition to risks related to unions;\n\u2022\nthose relating to franchisee changes in control and succession in general and the ability to find acceptable successors who would be able to perform a former franchisee\u2019s obligations under applicable franchise agreements or successfully operate impacted stores in the event of a change of control or other succession event;\n\u2022\nthose relating to franchisee insurance, including the inadequacy of, or inability to obtain, insurance coverage, losses in excess of policy limits or payments not being made on a timely basis, extraordinary hazards not being subject to coverage (or only being subject to coverage at prohibitively high rates) or third parties seeking to recover certain losses from us to the extent those losses experienced by such third parties are either not covered by the franchisee\u2019s insurance or exceed the policy limits of the franchisee\u2019s insurance;\n\u2022\nthose relating to instances of termination of or default under a franchisee\u2019s franchise agreement or the non-renewal\nthereof at the end of such agreement\u2019s expiration date and the corresponding impact on the franchisee\u2019s or our operations;\n\u2022\nthose relating to product liability exposure or noncompliance with health and safety regulations and the resulting impact such events could have on a franchisee\u2019s ability to make payments under applicable franchise agreements, on us if an aggrieved party seeks to recover their losses from us and on our brand\u2019s reputation;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of injunctive relief, fines, damage awards or capital expenditures under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, or other laws or regulations that could adversely affect the ability of a franchisee to make payments under applicable franchise agreements;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving franchisees, including litigation involving us or litigation involving a third-party directed at a franchisee, which could decrease the ability of a defendant-franchisee to make its royalty payments and divert our resources regardless of whether the allegations in such litigation are valid or whether we are liable; and\n\u2022\nthose relating to the reliance of a franchised store business on its franchisees and the nature of franchisees in general, including the retention of franchisees (especially including our top-performing\nfranchisees) in the future or our ability to attract, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers of franchisees of the same caliber in the future.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to credit card and debit card payments we accept.\nAs store operators, we and our franchisees accept payments through credit card and debit card transactions. For credit card and debit card payments, we and our franchisees pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time, potentially increasing our operating expenses and those of our franchisees and requiring an increase in the prices charged for our products, either of which could harm our operating results. If there are malfunctions or other problems with our or our franchisees\u2019 processing vendors, billing software or payment processing systems, our or our franchisees\u2019 customer satisfaction may be adversely affected and one or more of the major payment networks could disallow us or our franchisees\u2019 continued use of their payment methods. If we or our franchisees fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card and debit card transactions or to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, we or our franchisees may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our or their security measures, fines and assessments from the card brands, and significantly higher credit card and debit card related costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe termination of our ability to process payments through any major payment network would significantly impair our ability to operate our business. We and our franchisees may need to expand or change our or their information systems to support different or emerging forms of payment methods, which may be time-consuming and expensive, and we or they may not realize a return on the investment.\nOur current insurance coverage may not be adequate, insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates, or at all.\nFor certain periods prior to December 1998 and for periods after December 2001, we maintain insurance coverage for workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and owned and non-owned\nautomobile liabilities. We are generally responsible for up to $2.0 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers\u2019 compensation and general liability, depending on policy year and line of coverage. We are generally responsible for up to between $500,000 and $5.5 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and non-owned\nautomobile liabilities, depending on policy year and line of coverage. Total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to $110.0 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and non-owned\nautomobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers\u2019 compensation. These insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business. In addition, in the future our insurance premiums may increase, and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all. Any such inadequacy of, or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of January 3, 2021, our consolidated total indebtedness was approximately $4.12 billion. We may also incur additional debt, which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for our business and our shareholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers that may have less debt.\nFurther, a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), and there is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate certain loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). The first publication of SOFR was released in April 2018. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement remains a question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain.\nIn addition, the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, pay dividends and engage in other transactions, and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur debt is rated by credit rating agencies. These agencies may downgrade their credit ratings for us based on the performance of our business, our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding indebtedness will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant.\nA downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things, increase our cost of borrowing, limit our ability to access capital, result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares, or require us to provide collateral for future borrowings, and thereby adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, in the amounts projected or at all, or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity. If we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to affect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all, our business may be harmed.\nThe terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default, which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nUnless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt, we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings. The securitized debt, under which certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes, contain a number of covenants, with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation. These covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nalter the business we conduct;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;\n\u2022\ndeclare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nincur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nincur liens; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nThe securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter. These restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock. Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy such a test. A breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt. If amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts, the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets.\nDuring the term following issuance, the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest in accordance with the terms of the debt agreements. Additionally, our senior notes have original scheduled principal payments of $42.0 million in 2021, $897.0 million in 2022, $33.0 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $1.15 billion in 2025, $20.8 million in 2026, $1.28 billion in 2027, $6.8 million in 2028 and $614.3 million in 2029. In accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if the leverage ratios for the Company are less than or equal to 5.0x total debt, as defined, to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the indenture governing our securitized debt, and no catch-up\nprovisions are applicable. As of the fourth quarter of 2020, we met the leverage ratio of less than 5.0x and, in accordance with our debt agreements, did not make the previously scheduled debt payments beginning in the first quarter of 2021.\nIf we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the term, our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and, other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling, general and administrative expenses, would not be available for operating our business.\nNo assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. In addition, our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing.\nThe indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events, cash flow would be further restricted.\nIn the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of its term), the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.\nRegulatory, Legal and Compliance Risks\nWe face risks of litigation, investigations, enforcement actions and negative publicity from customers, franchisees, suppliers, employees, regulators and others in the ordinary course of business, which could divert our financial and management resources. Litigation, investigations, enforcement actions or publicity may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry, and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business. We are currently subject to these types of claims and have been subject to these types of claims in the past. Claims within our industry of improper supplier actions also occasionally arise that, if made against one of our suppliers, could potentially damage our brand image. In addition, class action lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, against various quick service restaurants alleging, among other things, that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with high-fat\nfoods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity. State attorney general offices or other regulators have initiated and may in the future initiate investigations or enforcement actions against us.\nIn addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources, adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially and adversely affect us and our brand, regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable, and could result in a substantial settlement, fine, penalty or judgment against us.\nFurther, we may be subject to employee, franchisee and other claims in the future based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment, working and safety conditions, wrongful termination and wage, expense reimbursement, rest break and meal break issues, including claims relating to overtime compensation. We have been and continue to be subject to these types of claims. If one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nWe and our franchisees are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as requirements issued by other groups, including those relating to:\n\u2022\nthe preparation, sale and labeling of food;\n\u2022\nbuilding and zoning requirements;\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection;\n\u2022\nlabor and employment, including minimum wage, overtime, insurance, discrimination and other labor requirements;\n\u2022\nworking and safety conditions;\n\u2022\nfranchise arrangements;\n\u2022\ntaxation;\n\u2022\nantitrust;\n\u2022\npayment card industry standards and requirements; and\n\u2022\ninformation privacy and consumer protection.\nWe are subject to an FTC rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises. These laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn August 2015, the National Labor Relations Board adopted a new and broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under the National Labor Relations Act. The National Labor Relations Board issued a final rule which became effective April 27, 2020 that reinstates the standard that was in place before August 2015. In December 2019, the National Labor Relations Board directed an administrative law judge to approve settlement agreements (rather than rejecting the settlement and allowing the claims asserting that the franchisor should be the joint employer of its franchisees\u2019 employees to proceed) in a decision related to another franchise system; however, an appeal of that decision is pending. If the August 2015 standard is restored or is adopted by other government agencies and/or applied generally to franchise relationships, it could cause us to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations of our franchisees and subject us to other liabilities, and require us to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of totally separate, independent employers, most notably our franchisees. In such event, our operating expenses may increase as a result of required modifications to our business practices, increased litigation, governmental investigations or proceedings, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil liability. Additionally, depending upon legal developments in California, franchisors may be subject to claims that their franchisees should be treated as employees and not as independent contractors in California and, potentially, certain other states and localities with similar employment laws. If such misclassification claims are successful against a franchisor, the franchisor could be liable to its franchisees (and potentially their employees) and, thereafter, have to treat its franchisees (and their employees) as the franchisor\u2019s employees under these laws.\nWe and our franchisees are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (the \u201cFair Labor Standards Act\u201d), which, along with the Family and Medical Leave Act, governs such matters as minimum wage and overtime requirements and other working conditions and various family leave mandates, as well as a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated, by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters. We and our franchisees have experienced and expect further increases in payroll expenses as a result of government-mandated increases in the minimum wage, and although such increases are not currently expected to be material, there may be material increases in the future. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for Domino\u2019s and franchisees\u2019 stores in a particular area or across the United States. In addition, third-party suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. Such increased expenses may cause our franchisees to exit the business or cause us to reduce the number of company-owned stores, or otherwise adversely affect the amount of royalty payments and license fees we receive.\nOn January 12, 2020, the U.S. Department of Labor announced a final rule to update and clarify the definition of joint employer under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Under the final rule, the general test for assessing whether a party can be deemed a joint employer would be based upon whether that party (i) hires or fires the employee; (ii) supervises and controls the employee\u2019s work schedule or conditions of employment; (iii) determines the employee\u2019s rate and method of payment; and (iv) maintains the employee\u2019s employment records. In the final rule, the Department of Labor describes instances in which joint employment would not be more or less likely to be found to exist under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which, according to the Department of Labor, includes the relationships that exist under the typical franchise business model. This rule may reduce a franchisor\u2019s risk of liability that currently exists under the joint employer standard now in effect under the Fair Labor Standards Act (though ultimately, the facts specific to the franchisor-franchisee model at issue would be considered when determining liability). On September 8, 2020, a federal district court struck down a significant portion of the final rule, and an appeal of that decision is currently pending. However, the U.S. Department of Labor rule is separate from the joint employer standard under the National Labor Relations Act, the final rule issued by the National Labor Relations Board, and, as described above, potential liability as a joint employer under the National Labor Relations Act.\nCertain governmental authorities and private litigants have recently asserted claims against franchisors, including us, for provisions in our prior franchise agreements that restrict franchisees from soliciting or hiring the employees of other franchisees or the applicable franchisor. Claims against franchisors for such clauses include allegations that these clauses violate state and federal antitrust and unfair practices laws by restricting the free movement of employees of franchisees and/or franchisor (including the employees of company-owned stores), thereby depressing the wages of those employees.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage. The majority of the increases in these costs began in 2015, and while the incremental costs of this program have not been material to us to date, we cannot predict what effect these costs will have on our results of operations and financial position, or the effects of the Affordable Care Act on some of our larger franchisees. Modifications to, or repeal of, all or certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act are possible, consistent with statements made by certain elected officials.\nChanges in tax laws or tax policy more broadly, increases in the enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere also has been increased public focus, including by U.S. and foreign governmental authorities, on environmental sustainability matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in taxes, restrictions on or increases in the costs of supplies, transportation and utilities, any of which could increase our operating costs and those of our franchisees, and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment. These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets, or establish additional goals to take actions to meet them, which could expose us and our franchisees to market, operational, execution and reputational costs or risks.\nWe may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax and/or regulate high-fat\nfoods, foods with high sugar and salt content, or foods otherwise deemed to be \u201cunhealthy,\u201d and our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation and compliance measures related to these laws or regulations.\nAdverse government regulations and enforcement efforts, including the examples mentioned above, or non-compliance\nby us or our franchisees with any of the foregoing laws and regulations could lead to various claims or governmental or judicial fines, sanctions or other enforcement measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket and General Risks\nAdverse global economic conditions subject us to additional risk.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control. An economic downturn, including deterioration in the economic conditions in the U.S. or international markets where we compete, may result in a reduction in the demand for our products, longer payment cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.\nPoor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue our growth strategy, which would reduce cash collections and in turn, may materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations.\nFluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings.\nExchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. International franchise royalties and fees represented approximately 6.1% of our total revenues in 2020, 6.7% of our total revenues in 2019 and 6.5% of our total revenues in 2018, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. Sales made by franchise stores outside the U.S. are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located, and this currency could become less valuable in U.S. dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the U.S. or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the U.S., or could result in lower revenues for us, on a U.S. dollar basis, from such customers and franchisees. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately $22.2 million in 2020.\nOur annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our share price may decline significantly or be subject to significant fluctuations.\nOur sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter\nand year-to-year\ndepending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things:\n\u2022\nvariations in the timing and volume of our sales and our franchisees\u2019 sales;\n\u2022\nthe timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;\n\u2022\nplanned or actual changes to our capital or debt structure;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as sales promotions, acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in our dividend policy or any share repurchase program;\n\u2022\nsignificant litigation;\n\u2022\nlegislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in competitive and economic conditions generally;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the cost or availability of our ingredients or labor; and\n\u2022\nforeign currency exposure.\nAs a result, our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products. Any such decline may cause us and our franchisees to experience lower sales revenue. We anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future, and such fluctuations may result in significant fluctuations or a significant decline in our share price.\nActions of activist investors could negatively impact our business and the value of our stock price.\nPublicly-traded companies have increasingly become subject to activist investor campaigns. Responding to actions of an activist investor may be a significant distraction for our management and staff and could require us to expend significant time and resources, including legal fees and potential proxy solicitation expenses. Any of these conditions could materially adversely affect our financial performance.", "PERMNO": 90248, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "DPZ"}
