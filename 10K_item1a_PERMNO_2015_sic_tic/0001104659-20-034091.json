Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in and incorporated into this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that may affect us. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the following events actually occur, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nBecause our loan portfolio consists largely of commercial business and commercial real estate loans, our portfolio carries a higher degree of risk than would a portfolio composed primarily of residential mortgage loans.\nOur loan portfolio is made up largely of commercial business loans and commercial real estate loans, most of which is collateralized by real estate. These types of loans generally expose a lender to a higher degree of risk of non-payment and loss than do residential mortgage loans because of several factors, including dependence on the successful operation of a business or a project for repayment, the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate, and loan terms with a balloon payment rather than full amortization over the loan term. In addition, commercial real estate and commercial loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Underwriting and portfolio management activities cannot completely eliminate all risks related to these loans. Any significant failure to pay on time by our customers or a significant default by our customers would materially and adversely affect us.\nWe make both secured and some unsecured commercial and industrial loans. Unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss than do secured loans because, without collateral, repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers\u2019 businesses. Secured commercial and industrial loans are generally collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and include a personal guaranty of the business owner. Compared to real estate, that type of collateral is more difficult to monitor, its value is harder to ascertain, it may depreciate more rapidly and it may not be as readily saleable if repossessed. Further, commercial and industrial loans generally will be serviced primarily from the operation of the business, which may not be successful, and commercial real estate loans generally will be serviced from income on the properties securing the loans.\nWhile any declines in the value of our real estate collateral securing loans have been reflected in existing reserves, the discounts and reserves we have taken against our loan portfolio based on our internal review of economic conditions and their impact on real estate values in our market areas may be insufficient. Deterioration in the real estate market or the economy could adversely affect the value of the properties securing the loans or revenues from borrowers\u2019 businesses, thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans and increased portfolio losses that could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe small businesses that make up the majority of our commercial borrowers generally do not have the cash reserves to help cushion them from an economic slowdown to the same extent that large borrowers do and thus may be more heavily impacted by an economic downturn. A return of recessionary conditions and/or other negative developments in the domestic or international credit markets or economies may have a negative effect on the ability of our commercial borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which could have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nConstruction loans are subject to risks during the construction phase that are not present in standard residential real estate and commercial real estate loans. These risks include:\n\u00b7 the viability of the contractor;\n\u00b7 the value of the project being subject to successful completion;\n\u00b7 the contractor\u2019s ability to complete the project, to meet deadlines and time schedules and to stay within cost estimates; and\n\u00b7 concentrations of such loans with a single contractor and its affiliates.\nReal estate construction and land loans also present risks of default in the event of declines in property values or volatility in the real estate market during the construction phase. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, we may not be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan, may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate amount of time. If any of these risks were to occur, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our commercial real estate loans were equal to 288% of our total risk-based capital. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance regarding high concentrations of commercial real estate loans within bank loan portfolios. The guidance requires financial institutions that exceed certain levels of commercial real estate lending compared with their total capital to maintain heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. If there is any deterioration in our commercial real estate or real estate construction and land portfolios or if our regulators conclude that we have not implemented appropriate risk management practices, it could adversely affect our business and result in a requirement that we increase our capital levels, and such capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Information security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As client, public, and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting and data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber-attacks.\nAs noted above, our business relies on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct its operations. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks, and our clients\u2019 devices may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. Third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including financial intermediaries, or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, and other third parties, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.\nWhile we have disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems of third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security involving these systems could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, third-party servicers accounting systems and mobile and online banking platforms. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, deposit processing systems and online banking platforms. While we have selected these vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Financial or operational difficulties of a vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our loan portfolio includes residential real estate loans, our earnings are sensitive to the credit risks associated with these types of loans.\nWhile we will cease originating residential first lien mortgage loans in early 2020, we will continue to originate home equity loans and home equity lines of credit within our local market area. In addition, we will purchase residential first lien mortgage loans in order to offset portfolio runoff. While residential real estate loans are more diversified than loans to commercial borrowers, and our local real estate market and economy have performed better than many other markets, a downturn could cause higher unemployment, more delinquencies, and could adversely affect the value of properties securing loans in our portfolio. In addition, should values begin to decline again, the real estate market may take longer to recover or not recover to previous levels. These risks increase the probability of an adverse impact on our financial results as fewer borrowers would be eligible to borrow and property values could be below necessary levels required for adequate coverage on the requested loan.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement a disposition or wind-down of certain business activities which no longer fit our strategic plan.\nIn December 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets related to our mortgage business, and we agreed to cease originating residential first lien mortgage loans and exit our mortgage banking activities in early 2020. In addition, we may engage in future dispositions or wind-downs of certain business. Key risks associated with exiting a business include:\n\u00b7 our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms;\n\u00b7 our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained business activities;\n\u00b7 our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business activity had with our retained business activities;\n\u00b7 our ability to replace legacy earnings from the exited business or activity with new revenues; and\n\u00b7 our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in significant legacy cash expenditures or financial loss.\nOur financial condition, earnings and asset quality could be adversely affected if we are required to repurchase loans originated for sale by our residential lending department.\nAs discussed in \u201cItem 1. Business - Mortgage Banking,\u201d most loans that we sell in the secondary market are with recourse. Therefore, we may be required to repurchase a previously sold mortgage loan or indemnify the purchaser if there is non-compliance with defined loan origination or documentation standards, including fraud, negligence or material misstatement in the loan documents, if the mortgagor has defaulted early in the loan term, or noncompliance with applicable law. While to date we have had to repurchase only a minimal amount of loans previously sold, should repurchases become a material issue, our earnings and asset quality could be adversely impacted, which could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.\nIf our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings would decrease.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans will not be sufficient to ensure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and ability to meet our obligations. Volatility and deterioration in domestic markets may also increase our risk for credit losses. We maintain an allowance for credit losses that we believe is adequate for absorbing any potential losses in our loan portfolio. Management, through a periodic review and consideration of our loan portfolio, determines the amount of the allowance for credit losses. We cannot, however, predict with certainty the amount of probable losses in our portfolio or be sure that our allowance will be adequate in the future. If management\u2019s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for credit losses is inadequate to absorb future losses, our losses will increase and our earnings will suffer.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance and a corresponding decrease to earnings. Material additions to the allowance could materially decrease our net income. If delinquencies and defaults should increase, we may be required to further increase our provision for loan losses.\nSignificant increases to our allowance would materially decrease our net income. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs to the allowance for credit losses. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNew accounting standards could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe measure of our allowance for credit losses is dependent on the adoption and interpretation of accounting standards. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, recently issued a new credit impairment model, the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL model, which will become applicable to us in 2023. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model currently required under GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for credit losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for credit losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for credit losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our estimates related to accounting for acquired loans may differ from actual results.\nThe application of the purchase method of accounting in our mergers and any future mergers or acquisitions will impact our allowance for credit losses. Under the purchase method of accounting, all acquired loans were recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements at their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition and any related allowance for loan loss was eliminated because credit quality, among other factors, was considered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that our estimates of fair value are too high, we will incur losses associated with the acquired loans. The allowance associated with our acquired credit impaired loans reflects deterioration in cash flows since acquisition resulting from our quarterly re-estimation of cash flows which involves complex cash flow projections and significant judgment on timing of loan resolution.\nIf the estimates we have made regarding the performance of loans we have acquired are inaccurate, the fair value estimates may exceed the actual collectability of the balances, and this may result in the related loans being considered by us as impaired, which would result in a reduction in interest income. The tangible book value we measure is based in part on these estimates, and if fair value estimates differ from actual collectability, then subsequent earnings may also differ from original estimates. Measures of tangible book value and earnings impact of business combinations are frequently used in evaluating the merits and value of business combinations. Numerous assumptions and estimates are integral to purchased loan accounting, and actual results could be different from prior estimates.\nOur growth strategy may not be successful, may be dilutive and may have other adverse consequences.\nAs previously mentioned, a key component of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches of other financial institutions, and we routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire additional financial institutions or branches or to open new branches. As consolidation of the banking industry continues, the competition for suitable acquisition candidates may increase. We compete with other banking companies for acquisition opportunities, and there are a limited number of candidates that meet our acquisition criteria. Consequently, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates for acquisitions. If we are unable to locate suitable acquisition candidates willing to sell on terms acceptable to us, our net income could decline and we would be required to find other methods to grow our business. We may also open additional branches organically and expand into new markets or offer new products and services.\nOur merger and acquisition activities could be material and could require us to use a substantial amount of common stock and dilute our existing stockholders, cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with our prior or potential future acquisitions were determined to be impaired, then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized.\nOur expansion activities could involve a number of additional risks, including:\n\u00b7 the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger partners;\n\u00b7 using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or its branches or assets;\n\u00b7 the time and expense associated with evaluating new markets for expansion, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices or branches as there may be a substantial time lag between these activities before we generate sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u00b7 operating in markets in which we have had no or only limited experience;\n\u00b7 taking a significant amount of time negotiating a transaction or working on expansion plans, resulting in management\u2019s time and attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u00b7 we may not be able to correctly identify profitable or growing markets for new branches;\n\u00b7 difficulty or unanticipated expense associated with converting the operating systems of the acquired or merged company into ours;\n\u00b7 the possibility that we will be unable to successfully implement integration strategies, due to challenges associated with integrating complex systems, technology, banking centers, and other assets of the acquired bank in a manner that minimizes any adverse effect on customers, suppliers, employees, and other constituencies;\n\u00b7 the possibility that the expected benefits of a transaction may not materialize in the timeframe expected or at all, or may be costlier to achieve;\n\u00b7 the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger or acquisition;\n\u00b7 creating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations;\n\u00b7 losing key employees and customers as a result of a merger or acquisition that is poorly received;\n\u00b7 the possibility of regulatory approval being delayed, impeded, conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues surrounding the Company, the target institution or the proposed combined entity as a result of, among other things, issues related to anti-money laundering/Bank Secrecy Act compliance, fair lending laws, fair housing laws, consumer protection laws, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations, or the CRA;\n\u00b7 delay in completing a merger or acquisition due to litigation;\n\u00b7 inability to obtain additional financing (including by issuing additional common equity), if necessary, on favorable terms or at all; and\n\u00b7 unforeseen adjustments, write-downs, write-offs or restructuring or other impairment charges.\nAlso, the costs to lease and start up new branch facilities or to acquire existing financial institutions or branches, and the additional costs to operate these facilities, may increase our noninterest expense. It also may be difficult to adequately and profitably manage the anticipated growth from the new branches. We can provide no assurance that any new branch sites will successfully attract a sufficient level of deposits and other banking business to offset their operating expenses.\nFurther, we plan to continue to make investments in our infrastructure in the future. We also currently plan to open additional branches in the areas where we now operate and in other markets over the next few years. We anticipate that this will have the short-term effect of, at least temporarily, increasing our expenses at a faster rate than revenue growth, which will have an adverse effect on net income.\nIf we grow too quickly and are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, growth could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we may not be successful in our growth strategy, which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing consumers to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, which may increase as consumers become more comfortable with these new technologies and offerings, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry within our market area is intense. In our market area, we compete with, among others, commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. There are also a number of smaller community-based banks that pursue similar operating strategies as the Bank. In addition, some of our competitors have recently offered loans with lower fixed rates and on more attractive terms than we have been willing to offer. Our continued profitability depends on our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and broader range of deposit and loan products offered by our competition may limit our ability to increase our interest earning assets and profitability. See \u201cItem 1. Business -Competition\u201d for more information about competition in our market area.\nWe expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Increased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services. Also, technological advances have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to compete in our market without a retail footprint by offering competitive rates and for non-banks to offer products and services that have traditionally been provided by banks. Additionally, due to their size, many of our competitors may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for certain products and services than we can, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends on our ability to successfully compete in our market area, and competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our ability to successfully implement our business plan, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the future. Further, if we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, competition in the banking and financial services industry is coming not only from traditional competitors but from technology-oriented financial services (\u201cFinTech\u201d) companies, which are subject to limited regulation. They offer user friendly front-end, quick turnaround times for loans and other benefits. While we are considering the possibility of developing relationships with FinTech companies for efficiency in processing and/or as a source of loans and other benefits, we cannot limit the possibility that our customers or future prospects will work directly with a FinTech company instead. This could impact our growth and profitability going forward.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven by new or modified products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must comply with extensive and complex governmental regulation, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our growth strategy, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state regulatory agencies. The Company is subject to FRB regulation, and the Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the FDIC and the Commissioner.\nMany of these regulations are intended to protect depositors, the public or the FDIC insurance funds, not stockholders. Regulatory requirements affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and many other aspects of our business. These requirements may constrain our operations, and changes in regulations could adversely affect us. The burden imposed by these federal and state regulations may place banks in general, and the Bank specifically, at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors. In addition, the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably or increase profitability. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d for more information about applicable banking laws and regulations.\nRegulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for credit losses. In addition, changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including, among other things, subjecting us to increased capital, liquidity and risk management requirements, creating additional costs, limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could also result in heightened regulatory scrutiny and in sanctions by regulatory agencies (such as a memorandum of understanding, a written supervisory agreement or a cease and desist order), civil money penalties and/or reputation damage. Any of these consequences could restrict our ability to expand our business or could require us to raise additional capital or sell assets on terms that are not advantageous to us or our shareholders and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, such violations may occur despite our best efforts.\nFurther, as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses in connection with compliance with rules of the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Patriot Act, the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nFinancial institutions are required under the PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act and other laws and regulations to, among other duties, institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nOur business may be adversely affected by economic conditions.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer and whose success we rely on to drive our growth, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the primary markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we are a regional bank that provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Great Baltimore Metropolitan area. The economic conditions in this local market may be different from, and in some instances worse than, the economic conditions in the United States as a whole. In addition, due to the proximity of our primary market area to Washington, D.C., decreases in spending by the Federal government or cuts to Federal government employment could impact us to a greater degree than banks that serve a larger or a different geographical area. Such risks are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the value of our common stock. Some elements of the business environment that affect our financial performance include short-term and long-term interest rates, the prevailing yield curve, inflation and price levels, monetary and trade policy, unemployment and the strength of the domestic economy and the local economy in the markets in which we operate. Unfavorable market conditions can result in a deterioration in the credit quality of our borrowers and the demand for our products and services, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, additional provisions for loan losses, adverse asset values of the collateral securing our loans and an overall material adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence\u037e limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital\u037e increases in inflation or interest rates\u037e high unemployment\u037e natural disasters\u037e epidemics or pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors.\nDuring 2019, the U.S. economy has continued to grow across a wide range of industries and regions in the United States. However, there are continuing concerns related to, among other things, the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address that debt, the potential effects of the novel coronavirus on international trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity and other economic activities, depressed oil prices and the U.S.-China trade disputes and related tariffs, that may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets and economic activity. There can be no assurance that current economic conditions will continue or improve, and economic conditions could worsen. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and saving habits. A return of recessionary conditions and/or other negative developments in the domestic or international credit markets or economies may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and high unemployment or underemployment may also result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs and the impacts of epidemics or pandemics, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere have been changes and discussions with respect to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could cause the prices of our customers\u2019 products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt\u037e which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future. It remains unclear what the U.S. Administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed, additional tariffs that may be imposed, or international trade agreements and policies. On January 26, 2020, President Trump signed a new trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. The full impact of this agreement on us, our customers and on the economic conditions in our primary banking markets is currently unknown. In addition, the novel coronavirus and concerns regarding the extent to which it may spread have affected, and may increasingly affect, international trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity and other economic activities. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies, as well as coronavirus or other potential epidemics or pandemics, have the potential to negatively impact ours and/or our customers\u2019 costs, demand for our customers' products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur profitability depends on interest rates, and changes in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations depends to a large extent on our \u201cnet interest income,\u201d which is the difference between the interest income received from our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities, such as interest on deposit accounts. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce loan demand and our ability to originate loans (which would also decrease our ability to generate noninterest income through the sale of loans into the secondary market), and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans or otherwise decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest earning assets, loan origination volume, loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios, and our overall results. Fluctuations in interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are not predictable or controllable. Therefore, while we attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, we might not be able to maintain a consistent positive spread between the interest that we receive and the interest that we pay. As a result, a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations.\nIn addition, as market interest rates rise, we will have competitive pressures to increase the rates we pay on deposits. Because interest rates we pay on our deposits could be expected to increase more quickly than the increase in the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income would be adversely affected.\nGovernmental economic and monetary policy will influence our results of operations. The rates of interest payable on deposits and chargeable on loans are affected by monetary policy as determined by various governmental and regulatory authorities, in particular the FRB, as well as by national, state and local economic conditions. The FRB, in an attempt to help the overall economy, has among other things kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. If the FRB increases the federal funds rate in the near term, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and U.S. economic growth. If rates remain relatively low it could create deflationary pressures, which while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a negative impact on our borrowers, especially our commercial borrowers, and the values of collateral securing our loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe also are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities.\nReforms to and uncertainty of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect us.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the LIBOR. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. The FRB in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing the U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. Whether or not SOFR attains traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question, although some transactions using SOFR have been completed in 2019, and the future of LIBOR remains uncertain as this time. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans, and securities in our portfolio. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers, we may experience significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers and creditors over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be subject to more stringent capital requirements in the future.\nWe are subject to regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that we must maintain. From time to time, the regulators change these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and we may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities.\nIn particular, the capital requirements applicable to the Bank under the Basel III rules become fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. The Bank is now required to satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy standards than it had in the past. While we expect to meet the requirements of the Basel III rules, we may fail to do so. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, these requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make acquisitions or make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases. Higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity.\nOur business may be adversely affected by increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.\nAs a financial institution, we are subject to risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We believe we have controls in place to detect and prevent such losses, but in some cases multi-party collusion or other sophisticated methods of hiding fraud may not be readily detected or detectable, and could result in losses that affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial crime is not limited to the financial services industry. Our customers could experience fraud in their businesses, which could materially impact their ability to repay their loans, and deposit customers in all financial institutions are constantly and unwittingly solicited by others in fraud schemes that vary from easily detectable and obvious attempts to high-level and very complex international schemes that could drain an account of millions of dollars and require detailed financial forensics to unravel. While we have controls in place, contractual agreements with our customers partitioning liability, and insurance to help mitigate the risk, none of these are guarantees that we will not experience a loss, potentially a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations.\nThe small and medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather a downturn in the economy, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan to the Bank that could materially harm our operating results.\nWe target our business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small and medium-sized businesses. These small and medium-sized businesses frequently have a smaller market share than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, may need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results. Any one or more of these factors may impair their ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on its business and its ability to repay a loan. As a result, economic downturns and other events that negatively impact our market areas and the businesses we serve could cause us to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, contain a number of provisions that could have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single family residential and multifamily residential real estate. Among the changes are: lower limits on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single family residential mortgages; limitations on deductibility of business interest expense; and limitations on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes. Such changes may have an adverse effect on the market for and valuation of single family residential properties and multifamily residential properties, as well as on the demand for such loans in the future. If home ownership or multifamily residential property ownership become less attractive, demand for mortgage loans would decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking operations and as a result on our revenues, net income, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the value of the properties securing loans in our portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership and multifamily residential ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for credit losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, certain borrowers could become less able to service their debts as a result of higher tax obligations. These changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to liquidity risks.\nMarket conditions could negatively affect the level or cost of available liquidity, which would affect our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences. Core deposits are our primary source of funding, but this is supplemented by overnight unsecured master notes, customer repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, the FRB Discount Window, subordinated debentures and other purchased funds. A significant decrease in our core deposits, an inability to renew FHLB advances or access the Discount Window, an inability to obtain alternative funding to core deposits or our other traditional sources of funds, or a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend heavily on key employees, Mary Ann Scully and Robert D. Kunisch, Jr., to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and the loss of their services could disrupt our operations and result in reduced earnings.\nMs. Scully is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Kunisch is our President. We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our senior management team. We believe these two executive officers possess valuable knowledge about and experience in the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be difficult to replicate. We have entered into an employment agreement with each of Ms. Scully and Mr. Kunisch and acquired key-person life insurance on each, but the existence of such agreements and insurance does not assure that we will be able to retain their services or recover losses associated with the loss of their services. The unexpected loss of the services of Ms. Scully or Mr. Kunisch could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and operating results, as well as the value of our common stock.\nWe may be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed on attractive terms, or at all.\nWe are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Our capital requirements for the foreseeable future are currently satisfied. We may at some point, however, need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth or if our liquidity is adversely affected by external factors such as a return of recessionary conditions and/or other negative developments in the domestic or international credit markets. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired, or the failure to raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, your interest in the Company could be diluted. Furthermore, if we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt securities, there can be no assurance that sufficient revenues or cash flow will exist to service such debt.\nOur investment securities portfolio is subject to credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk.\nOur investment securities portfolio is subject to risks beyond our control that may significantly influence its fair value. These include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults of the issuers of the securities, lack of market pricing of the securities, and instability in the credit markets. Lack of market activity with respect to some securities has, in certain circumstances, required us to base their fair market valuation on unobservable inputs. Any changes in these risk factors, in current accounting principles or interpretations of these principles could impact our assessment of fair value and thus the determination of other-than-temporary impairment of the securities in the investment securities portfolio. Investment securities that previously were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired could require further write-downs due to continued erosion of the creditworthiness of the issuer. Write-downs of investment securities would negatively affect our earnings and regulatory capital ratios.\nFurther, most of our securities investment portfolio as of December 31, 2019 has been designated as available for sale pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 320 - \u201cInvestments.\u201d ASC Topic 320 requires that unrealized gains and losses in the estimated value of the available for sale portfolio be \u201cmarked to market\u201d and reflected as a separate item in stockholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. If the market value of the investment portfolio declines, this could cause a corresponding decline in stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur lending limit may limit our growth.\nWe are limited in the amount we can loan to a single borrower by the amount of our capital. Generally, under current law, we may lend up to 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus to any one borrower. Based upon our current capital levels, such amount is significantly less than that of many of our competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of our lending limit from doing business with us. We accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy may not always be available.\nThe failure to maintain our reputation may materially adversely affect our ability to grow and generate revenue.\nOur reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. Damage to our reputation could undermines the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and therefore could negatively affect our earnings. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, mergers and acquisitions and cybersecurity incidents, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Damage to our reputation could affect the confidence of rating agencies, regulators, stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business. Failure to maintain our reputation ultimately would have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain and grow our business. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has increased the risk that our reputation could be negatively impacted in a short amount of time. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to any incidents negatively impacting our reputation, it could have a material and long-term negative impact on our business and, therefore, our operating results.\nWe are party to various claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties such that the expenses and ultimate exposure with respect to many of these matters cannot be ascertained.\nFrom time to time, we are the subject of various claims and legal actions by customers, employees, stockholders and others. Whether such claims and legal actions are legitimate or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. In light of the potential cost and uncertainty involved in litigation, we have in the past and may in the future settle matters even when we believe we have a meritorious defense. Certain claims may seek injunctive relief, which could disrupt the ordinary conduct of our business and operations or increase our cost of doing business. Our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Any judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future claims, litigation or investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time we are, or may become, involved in suits, legal proceedings, information-gatherings, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.\nMany aspects of the banking business involve a substantial risk of legal liability. From time to time, we are, or may become, the subject of information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings, and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, self-regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgements, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way we conduct our business or reputational harm.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nAnti-takeover provisions in our corporate documents and in federal and state law may make it difficult and expensive to remove current management.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and federal and state banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our stockholders. For example, we have a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board. In addition, directors may only be removed from office by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of all of the votes of our stockholders entitled to be cast. Our articles of incorporation also authorize our board to classify or reclassify shares of our stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock, and to amend our articles without stockholder approval to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock that we have authority to issue. The combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult and expensive for holders of our common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors or otherwise remove existing directors and management, even if current management is not performing adequately.\nMaryland law and our articles of incorporation limit the liability of our directors and officers and the rights of us and our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers.\nMaryland law provides that a director will not have any liability as a director as long as he or she performs his or her duties in accordance with the applicable standard of conduct. In addition, our articles of incorporation eliminate our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability to us and our stockholders for money damages to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws also require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to changes in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects. Factors that may affect market sentiment include:\n\u00b7 operating results that vary from the expectations of our management or of securities analysts and investors;\t\n\u00b7 developments in our business or in the financial service sector generally;\n\u00b7 regulatory or legislative changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations in particular;\n\u00b7 operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7 changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other material events by us or our competitors; and\n\u00b7 changes in financial markets and national and local economies and general market conditions, such as interest rates and stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.\nWhile the U.S. and other governments continue efforts to restore confidence in financial markets and promote economic growth, market and economic turmoil could still occur in the near- or long-term, negatively affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the price, trading volume and volatility of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to, or may continue to choose not to, pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends to holders of our common stock. Although we may pay cash dividends in the future, we currently intend to retain a large majority of any earnings to help fund our growth. Our ability to pay cash dividends may be limited by regulatory restrictions, by our Bank\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends to the Company and by our need to maintain sufficient capital to support our operations. The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the FRB\u2019s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The FRB\u2019s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nSince the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and does not conduct stand-alone operations, its ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to it. As a Maryland-chartered trust company, the Bank is subject to limitations on the amount of dividends that it is permitted to pay. The federal banking agencies have also issued policy statements which provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current earnings.\nIf our Bank is not permitted to pay cash dividends to the Company, it is unlikely that we would be able to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Moreover, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, and if declared by our board of directors. If we fail to pay dividends in the future, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be the sole opportunity for gains on an investment in our common stock. In addition, in the event the Bank becomes unable to pay dividends to the Company, we may not be able to service our debt or pay our other obligations. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s inability to receive dividends from the Bank could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe can sell additional shares of common stock without consulting stockholders and without offering shares to existing stockholders, which would result in dilution of our stockholders\u2019 interests and could depress our stock price.\nOur articles of incorporation currently authorize an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of common stock, 18,714,844 of which are outstanding as of February 27, 2020. As permitted by Maryland law, our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors can amend our articles of incorporation, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of any class of stock that we have the authority to issue. Our board of directors is further authorized to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, at such times and for such consideration as it may determine, without stockholder action. Because our common stockholders do not have preemptive rights to purchase shares of our capital stock (that is, the right to purchase a stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of any securities issued by us), any future offering of capital stock could have a dilutive effect on holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13532, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HBMD"}
