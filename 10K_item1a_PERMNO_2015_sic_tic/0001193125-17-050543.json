{"cik": "1060736", "company": "SEATTLE GENETICS INC /WA", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the events described in the following risk factors occurs, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur near-term prospects are substantially dependent on ADCETRIS. If we and/or Takeda are unable to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS for the treatment of patients in its approved indications and to continue to expand its labeled indications of use, our ability to generate significant revenue or potentially achieve profitability will be adversely affected.\nADCETRIS\u00ae, or brentuximab vedotin, is now approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Commission for three indications, encompassing several settings for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or sALCL. ADCETRIS is our only product approved for marketing and our ability to generate revenue from product sales and potentially achieve profitability is substantially dependent on our continued ability to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS for the treatment of patients in its approved indications and our ability to continue to expand its labeled indications of use. We may not be able to fully realize the commercial potential of ADCETRIS for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market ADCETRIS for any additional indications, including for relapsed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL, frontline Hodgkin lymphoma or frontline mature T-cell lymphoma, or MTCL, or to otherwise continue to expand its labeled indications of use;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results in our ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 phase 3 trials would negatively impact, or preclude altogether, our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize ADCETRIS in the frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline MTCL indications, respectively, either of which could limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize ADCETRIS in the ALCANZA treatment setting notwithstanding the positive data we reported from our ALCANZA trial, which would also limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS;\n\u2022\nresults from our required post-approval study, the ECHELON-2 trial, may fail to verify the clinical benefit of ADCETRIS in relapsed sALCL, which could result in the withdrawal of approval of ADCETRIS in the relapsed sALCL indication and which could negatively impact our potential future product sales for the relapsed sALCL indication;\n\u2022\nnew competitive therapies, including immuno-oncology agents such as PD-1 inhibitors (e.g., nivolumab and pembrolizumab), have been approved by regulatory authorities (as in the case of nivolumab) or may be submitted in the near term to regulatory authorities for approval in ADCETRIS\u2019 labeled indications in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, and these competitive products could negatively impact our commercial sales of ADCETRIS;\n\u2022\nour commercial sales of ADCETRIS could be lower than our projections due to a lower market penetration rate, increased competition by alternative products or biosimilars, or a shorter duration of therapy in patients in ADCETRIS\u2019 approved indications;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS in any new indications for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthere may be additional changes to the label for ADCETRIS, including ADCETRIS\u2019 boxed warning, that further restrict how we market and sell ADCETRIS, including as a result of data collected from our required post-approval study, or as the result of adverse events observed in that study or in other studies, including in the post-approval confirmatory studies that Takeda is required to conduct as a condition to the conditional marketing authorization of ADCETRIS by the European Commission or in investigator-sponsored studies;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to establish or demonstrate in the medical community the safety and efficacy of ADCETRIS and its potential advantages over and side effects compared to existing and future therapeutics;\n\u2022\nphysicians may be reluctant to prescribe ADCETRIS until results from our required post-approval study are available or other long term efficacy and safety data exist;\n\u2022\nthe estimated incidence rate of new patients in ADCETRIS\u2019 approved indications may be lower than our projections;\n\u2022\nthere may be adverse results or events reported in any of the clinical trials that we and/or Takeda are conducting or may in the future conduct for ADCETRIS;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to continue to effectively market, sell and distribute ADCETRIS;\n\u2022\nADCETRIS may be impacted by adverse reimbursement and coverage policies from government and private payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators, or may be subject to pricing pressures enacted by industry organizations or state and federal governments, including as a result of increased scrutiny over drug-pricing strategies by pharmaceutical companies or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe relative price of ADCETRIS may be higher than alternative treatment options;\n\u2022\nthere may be changed or increased regulatory restrictions;\n\u2022\nwe may not have adequate financial or other resources to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain adequate commercial supplies of ADCETRIS to meet demand or at an acceptable cost.\nIn December 2009, we entered into an agreement with Takeda to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS, under which we have commercial rights in the United States and its territories and Canada, and Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world. The success of this collaboration and the activities of Takeda will significantly impact the commercialization of ADCETRIS in countries other than the United States and in Canada. In October 2012, Takeda announced that it had received conditional marketing authorization for ADCETRIS from the European Commission for patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma or relapsed sALCL, and has since obtained marketing approvals for ADCETRIS in many other countries. Conditional marketing authorization by the European Commission includes obligations to provide additional clinical data at a later stage to confirm the positive benefit-risk balance. In July 2016, Takeda announced that it had received marketing authorization for ADCETRIS from the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma at increased risk of relapse or progression following autologous stem cell transplant. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources that Takeda dedicates to the commercialization of ADCETRIS, or to its marketing and distribution, and our ability to generate revenues from ADCETRIS product sales by Takeda depends on Takeda\u2019s ability to achieve market acceptance of, and to otherwise effectively market, ADCETRIS for its approved indications in Takeda\u2019s territory.\nWe believe that the level of our ongoing ADCETRIS sales in the United States is largely attributable to the incidence flow of patients eligible for treatment with ADCETRIS. We also believe that the incidence rate of new patients in ADCETRIS\u2019 approved indications is relatively low, particularly when compared to many other oncology indications. For these and other reasons, we expect that our ability to accelerate ADCETRIS sales\ngrowth, if at all, will depend primarily on our ability to continue to expand ADCETRIS\u2019 labeled indications of use. Accordingly, we are exploring the use of ADCETRIS as a single agent and in combination therapy regimens earlier in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma and MTCL, including sALCL, and in a range of CD30-expressing hematologic malignancies, including CD30-expressing relapsed CTCL. This will continue to require additional time and investment in clinical trials and there can be no assurance that we and/or Takeda will obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals to market ADCETRIS for any additional indications. In particular, negative or inconclusive results in our ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 trials would negatively impact, or preclude altogether, our ability to obtain regulatory approval in the frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline MTCL, indications, respectively, either of which could limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS. For example, in accordance with the terms of their respective SPA, the ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 trials are designed to continue until a specified number of events designated for each trial have occurred (i.e. progressions or deaths). If events do not occur at the rate which was anticipated in one or both of these trials, the final data analysis for the applicable trial could be delayed beyond the predicted ranges. In addition, we may choose for a variety of reasons to complete the applicable trial with fewer events than planned. If we choose to complete a trial with fewer events than planned, the FDA may treat the applicable SPA as rescinded and the statistical power of that trial based on the original statistical analysis plan could be negatively impacted, making it more difficult for us to demonstrate that ADCETRIS is safe and effective and to successfully obtain regulatory approval for the specific indication studied in that trial. We may also undertake additional discussions with regulatory authorities or amend the protocol for one or both of these trials, and we cannot predict the outcome of those discussions or whether we would be able to reach agreement with the regulatory authorities. Should this situation occur, there could be a delay in our ability to obtain data from the applicable trial or impact the ability of the applicable trial to support approval of ADCETRIS for the specific indication studied in that trial.\nIn addition, although we reported in August 2016 that the ALCANZA trial evaluating ADCETRIS in patients with relapsed CTCL met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the rate of objective response lasting at least four months and we plan to submit a supplemental Biologics License Application, or sBLA, to the FDA to seek approval for a new indication in CD30-expressing relapsed CTCL, there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept our planned sBLA for filing or that we will ultimately obtain approval of our planned sBLA in a timely manner or at all. Our failure to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize ADCETRIS in the ALCANZA treatment setting would also limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS. In addition, while ADCETRIS product sales grew from 2014 to 2015 and from 2015 to 2016, and our future plans assume that sales of ADCETRIS will increase, we cannot assure you that ADCETRIS sales will continue to grow or that we can maintain sales of ADCETRIS at or near current levels.\nWe and Takeda have formed a collaboration with Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., or Ventana, under which Ventana is working to develop, manufacture and commercialize a molecular companion diagnostic test with the goal of identifying patients who might respond to treatment with ADCETRIS based on CD30 expression levels in their tissue specimens. However, Ventana may not be able to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for a molecular companion diagnostic that may be required by regulatory authorities to support regulatory approval of ADCETRIS in other CD30-expressing malignancies in a timely manner or at all.\nEven if we and Takeda receive the required regulatory approvals to market ADCETRIS for any additional indications or in additional jurisdictions, we and Takeda may not be able to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS, including for the reasons set forth above. Our ability to grow ADCETRIS product sales in future periods is also dependent on price increases and we periodically increase the price of ADCETRIS. Price increases on ADCETRIS and negative publicity regarding drug pricing and price increases generally, whether on ADCETRIS or products distributed by other pharmaceutical companies, could negatively affect market acceptance of, and sales of, ADCETRIS. In any event, we cannot assure you that price increases we have taken or may take in the future will not in the future negatively affect ADCETRIS sales.\nReports of adverse events or safety concerns involving ADCETRIS or our product candidates could delay or prevent us from obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals, or could negatively impact sales of ADCETRIS or the prospects for our product candidates.\nReports of adverse events or safety concerns involving ADCETRIS could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of ADCETRIS, including the ongoing FDA-required ADCETRIS post-approval confirmatory study as well as the post-approval confirmatory studies that Takeda is required to conduct as a condition to the conditional marketing authorization of ADCETRIS by the European Commission. For example, during 2013 concerns regarding pancreatitis caused an investigator conducting an independent study involving ADCETRIS to temporarily halt enrollment in the trial and to amend the eligibility criteria and monitoring for the trial. Subsequently, we have revised our prescribing information to add pancreatitis as a known adverse event. In addition, reports of adverse events or safety concerns involving ADCETRIS could result in regulatory authorities denying or withdrawing approval of ADCETRIS for any or all indications, including the use of ADCETRIS for the treatment of patients in its approved indications. There are no assurances that patients receiving ADCETRIS will not experience serious adverse events in the future. Further, there are no assurances that patients receiving ADCETRIS with co-morbid diseases not previously studied, such as autoimmune diseases, will not experience new or different serious adverse events in the future.\nAdverse events may negatively impact the sales of ADCETRIS. We may be required to further update the ADCETRIS prescribing information, including boxed warnings, based on reports of adverse events or safety concerns or implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which could adversely affect ADCETRIS\u2019 acceptance in the market, make competition easier or make it more difficult or expensive for us to distribute ADCETRIS. For example, the prescribing information for ADCETRIS includes pancreatitis, impaired hepatic function, impaired renal function, pulmonary toxicity, and gastrointestinal complications as known adverse events as well as a boxed warning related to the risk that JC virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, and death can occur in patients receiving ADCETRIS. Further, based on the identification of future adverse events, we may be required to further revise the prescribing information, including ADCETRIS\u2019 boxed warning, which could negatively impact sales of ADCETRIS or adversely affect ADCETRIS\u2019 acceptance in the market.\nLikewise, reports of adverse events or safety concerns involving ADCETRIS or our product candidates could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of such product candidates, or could result in our inability to obtain regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates. For example, on December 27, 2016, we announced that we had received notice from the FDA that a full clinical hold or partial clinical hold had been placed on several early stage trials of SGN-CD33A in AML to evaluate the potential risk of hepatotoxicity following adverse medical events, including fatal events. We may be unable to submit to the FDA all required clinical follow-up information to respond to the clinical holds. Even if we are able to provide such information, the FDA may not deem the information to be sufficient to lift any or all of the clinical holds. In addition, we may encounter delays in reaching an agreement with the FDA regarding the terms under which these trials may be resumed, or we may elect to discontinue one or more of these trials for safety or any other reasons. Furthermore, the FDA may require us to implement additional, potentially burdensome pharmacovigilance procedures or conduct additional pre-clinical studies before it will consider lifting the clinical holds, if at all. In addition, although the FDA has not placed a clinical hold on the CASCADE trial or our phase 1/2 trial in MDS and we continue to enroll patients in these trials, we cannot assure you that the FDA or another regulatory authority will not place a clinical hold on one or both of these trials. If we are unable to submit required information to the FDA in a timely manner, or at all; if the FDA does not lift the clinical holds in a timely manner, or at all; if the FDA does not permit us to initiate additional trials of SGN-CD33A and/or the FDA imposes clinical holds on the CASCADE trial or our phase 1/2 trial in MDS; or if there are additional safety results, including from our ongoing trials of SGN-CD33A, that alter the benefit-risk profile of SGN-CD33A or cause it to become unacceptable, we would be further delayed or prevented from advancing the clinical development of SGN-CD33A, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nConcerns regarding the safety of ADCETRIS or our product candidates as a result of undesirable side effects identified during clinical testing or otherwise could cause the FDA to order us to cease further development or commercialization of ADCETRIS or the applicable product candidate. Undesirable side effects caused by ADCETRIS or our product candidates could also result in denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, the requirement of additional trials or the inclusion of unfavorable information in our product labeling, and in turn delay or prevent us from commercializing ADCETRIS or the applicable product candidate. In addition, actual or potential drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete a trial for ADCETRIS or our product candidates or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these events could prevent us from developing or commercializing ADCETRIS or the particular product candidate, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nEven though we have obtained approval to market ADCETRIS in three indications, we are subject to extensive ongoing regulatory obligations and review, including post-approval requirements that could result in the withdrawal of ADCETRIS from the market for certain indications if such requirements are not met.\nADCETRIS is approved for treating patients in one indication, the relapsed sALCL indication, under accelerated approval regulations in the U.S. and approval with conditions in two indications in Canada, which allow for approval of products for cancer or other serious or life threatening illnesses based on a surrogate endpoint or on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. Under these types of approvals, we are subject to certain post-approval requirements pursuant to which we are conducting an additional confirmatory phase 3 trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit of ADCETRIS. Our failure to complete this required post-approval study, or to confirm a clinical benefit during this post-approval study, could result in the withdrawal of approval of ADCETRIS in the relapsed sALCL indication in the U.S. and both indications in Canada, which would seriously harm our business. In addition, under the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval regulations, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion of ADCETRIS for the treatment of patients with relapsed sALCL is subject to extensive regulatory requirements all of which entails significant expense and may limit our ability to commercialize ADCETRIS for the relapsed sALCL indication. Similarly, the conditional marketing authorization of ADCETRIS for two indications by the European Commission includes obligations to provide additional clinical data at a later time to confirm the results of the two pivotal studies. Takeda\u2019s failure to provide these additional clinical data or to confirm the results of the pivotal studies, could result in the European Commission withdrawing approval of ADCETRIS in the European Union, which would negatively impact anticipated royalty revenue from ADCETRIS sales by Takeda in the European Union and could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensive ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review from applicable regulatory agencies with respect to any product for which we have obtained regulatory approval, including ADCETRIS in each of its approved indications, such as continued adverse event reporting requirements and the requirement to have some of our promotional materials pre-cleared by the FDA. There may also be additional post-marketing obligations, all of which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize ADCETRIS in the United States, Canada or potentially other jurisdictions.\nWe and the manufacturers of ADCETRIS are also required to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture ADCETRIS, and these facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspections. In addition, regulatory agencies subject an approved product, its manufacturer and the manufacturer\u2019s facilities to continual review and inspections, including periodic unannounced inspections. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with ADCETRIS, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facilities where ADCETRIS is manufactured, may result in restrictions on the marketing of ADCETRIS, up to and including withdrawal of ADCETRIS from the market. If our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such noncompliance could result in regulatory action and additional costs to us.\nFailure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u2022\nissuance of Form FDA 483 notices or Warning Letters by the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nimposition of fines and other civil penalties;\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecutions;\n\u2022\ninjunctions, suspensions or revocations of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of manufacturing;\n\u2022\ndelays in commercialization;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022\nrefusals to permit drugs to be imported into or exported from the United States;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and\n\u2022\nproduct recalls or seizures.\nThe policies of the FDA and other regulatory agencies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of ADCETRIS in any additional indications or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we or Takeda might not be permitted to market ADCETRIS and our business would suffer.\nIf we or our collaborators are not able to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals, we or our collaborators will not be able to successfully commercialize ADCETRIS or our product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. Neither we nor our collaborators are permitted to market our product candidates in the United States or foreign countries until we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities, and we or our collaborators may never receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates. In addition, part of our strategy is to continue to explore the use of ADCETRIS earlier in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma and MTCL and in other CD30-expressing malignancies, including CTCL, and we are currently conducting multiple clinical trials for ADCETRIS. However, we and/or Takeda may be unable to obtain or maintain any regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of ADCETRIS for any additional indications. Obtaining marketing approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process and approval is never assured, and we have only limited experience in preparing and submitting the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals. Further, the FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process, and determining when or whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any product candidate we develop, including any regulatory approvals for the potential commercial sale of ADCETRIS in additional indications or in any additional territories. In this regard, even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of ADCETRIS and our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or any other foreign regulatory authority. In addition, the FDA or their advisors may disagree with our interpretations of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. In this regard, based on the positive data we reported from the ALCANZA trial, we plan to submit an sBLA to the FDA to seek approval for a new indication in CD30-expressing relapsed CTCL. Even if the FDA accepts our planned sBLA for filing, the FDA may disagree with our interpretations of the data from the ALCANZA trial and/or may otherwise determine not to approve our planned sBLA in a timely manner\nor at all. Moreover, even though our ALCANZA, ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 trials are being conducted under SPA agreements with the FDA, this is not a guarantee or indication of approval, and we cannot be certain that the design of, or data collected from, any of our current or potential future clinical trials that were or are being conducted under SPAs with the FDA will be sufficient to support FDA approval. Further, an SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if public health concerns unrecognized at the time the SPA agreement is entered into become evident, other new scientific concerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise, new drugs are approved in the same indication, or if we have failed to comply with the agreed upon trial protocols. In addition, an SPA agreement may be changed by us or the FDA on written agreement of both parties, and the FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of an SPA agreement and the data and results from the applicable clinical trial. For example, even though we believe that the data from the ALCANZA trial are supportive of approval of ADCETRIS in the ALCANZA treatment setting, our SPA with the FDA covering the ALCANZA trial is not a guarantee or indication of approval of ADCETRIS in the ALCANZA treatment setting (or in any other indication). Regulatory agencies also may approve a product candidate for fewer indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-approval studies or REMS for a product candidate. Similarly, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of ADCETRIS in additional indications, including any indications in the ALCANZA treatment setting.\nIn addition, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols and/or related SPA agreements to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to institutional review boards, or IRBs, for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. In addition, as part of the U.S. Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has a goal to review and act on a percentage of all regulatory submissions in a given time frame. However, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA targeted action dates and if the FDA were to fail to meet a PDUFA targeted action date in the future for ADCETRIS or any of our product candidates, including in connection with our planned sBLA submission to seek approval to market ADCETRIS in the ALCANZA treatment setting, the commercialization of the affected product candidate or of ADCETRIS in any additional indications could be delayed or impaired. Due to these and other factors, ADCETRIS and our product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approvals than we expect or may never gain new regulatory approvals, which could delay or eliminate any potential product revenue from sales of our product candidates or of ADCETRIS in any additional indications, which could significantly delay or prevent us from achieving profitability.\nThe successful commercialization of ADCETRIS and product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities and health insurers establish adequate coverage and reimbursement levels and pricing policies.\nSuccessful sales of ADCETRIS and any future products will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. To manage healthcare costs, many governments and third-party payors increasingly scrutinize the pricing of new products and require greater levels of evidence of favorable clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness before extending coverage. In light of such challenges to prices, we cannot be sure that we will achieve and continue to have coverage available for ADCETRIS and any other product candidate that we commercialize and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, their marketability will be negatively and materially impacted.\nMoreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. In addition, obtaining and maintaining adequate coverage and reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly. Third-party payors may deny coverage and reimbursement status altogether of a given drug product, or cover the product but may also establish prices at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, one payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a product does\nnot assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Because the rules and regulations regarding coverage and reimbursement change frequently, in some cases at short notice, even when there is favorable coverage and reimbursement, future changes may occur that adversely impact the favorable status.\nThe unavailability or inadequacy of third-party coverage and reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on the market acceptance of ADCETRIS and any of our future products and the future revenues we may expect to receive from those products. In addition, we are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future, or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business. Recent negative publicity regarding pharmaceutical prices and the results of the 2016 United States presidential and congressional elections create significant uncertainty regarding regulation of the healthcare industry and third party coverage and reimbursement.\nHealthcare law and policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively PPACA, became law in the United States. PPACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry. The provisions of PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry include increased Medicaid rebates, expanded Medicaid eligibility, extension of Public Health Service eligibility, annual fees payable by manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, annual reporting of financial relationships with physicians and teaching hospitals, and a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. Many of these provisions have had the effect of reducing the revenue generated by our sales of ADCETRIS and will have the effect of reducing any revenue generated by sales of any future commercial products we may have. Further, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of PPACA In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of PPACA. The Budget Resolution is not a law; however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of PPACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of PPACA that are repealed. Because of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of PPACA, including the potential for further legal challenges or repeal of PPACA, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA or its repeal on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we anticipate that PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for ADCETRIS or any future approved product, which may harm our business. For example, increased discounts, rebates or chargebacks may be mandated by governmental or private insurers or fee caps and pricing pressures could be enacted by industry organizations or state and federal governments, any of which could significantly affect the revenue generated by sales of our products, including ADCETRIS. In addition, drug- pricing strategies by pharmaceutical companies have recently come under increased scrutiny. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. We expect further federal and state proposals and healthcare reforms to continue to be proposed to control increasing healthcare costs and to control the rising cost of prescription drugs. These proposals, if implemented, could limit the price for ADCETRIS or any future approved products. Commercial opportunity could be negatively impacted by legislative action that controls pricing, mandates price negotiations, or increases government discounts and rebates. For example, in March 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, proposed to conduct a demonstration project that would reduce the Medicare\npayment rates for most Part B drugs for approximately half of all providers. If implemented, this project could potentially limit our ability to change pricing for ADCETRIS and all drugs reimbursed under Medicare Part B. Implementation could negatively impact future revenue from sales of ADCETRIS. We cannot predict how this initiative will be affected by the change in U.S. presidential administrations.\nAlso, price increases on ADCETRIS and negative publicity regarding drug pricing and price increases generally, whether on ADCETRIS or products distributed by other pharmaceutical companies, could negatively affect market acceptance of, and sales of, ADCETRIS. In addition, although ADCETRIS is approved in the European Union, Japan and other countries outside of the United States, government austerity measures or further healthcare reform measures and pricing pressures in other countries could adversely affect demand and pricing for ADCETRIS, which would negatively impact anticipated royalty revenue from ADCETRIS sales by Takeda.\nOther legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes a 2% reduction in Medicare provider payments paid under Medicare Part B to physicians for physician-administered drugs, such as certain oral oncology drugs, which went into effect in April 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, legislation has been proposed to shorten the period of biologic data and market exclusivity granted by the FDA. If such legislation is enacted, we may face competition from biosimilars of ADCETRIS or any future approved products earlier than otherwise would have occurred.\nWe cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. However, we anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system. We also expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation; however, such changes or the ultimate impact of changes could negatively affect our revenue or sales of ADCETRIS or any future approved products.\nClinical trials are expensive and time consuming, may take longer than we expect or may not be completed at all, and their outcome is uncertain.\nWe are currently conducting multiple clinical trials for ADCETRIS and our product candidates and we plan to commence additional trials of ADCETRIS and our product candidates in the future. We are also conducting a phase 3 clinical trial for our product candidate SGN-CD33A, or the CASCADE trial, designed to evaluate SGN-CD33A in combination with hypomethylating agents, or HMAs, in previously untreated older AML patients. We initiated the CASCADE trial based on interim data presented at the December 2015 American Society of Hematology annual meeting from a cohort of a phase 1 trial that evaluated SGN-CD33A in combination with HMAs. While the interim phase 1 data may be promising, SGN-CD33A has not previously been evaluated in a randomized trial with other active agents and we cannot be certain that the design of, or data collected from, the CASCADE trial will be adequate to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of SGN-CD33A for the treatment of patients with AML, or will otherwise be sufficient to support FDA or any foreign regulatory approvals. In this regard, on December 27, 2016, we announced that we had received notice from the FDA that a full clinical hold or partial clinical hold had been placed on several early stage trials of SGN-CD33A in AML to evaluate the potential risk of hepatotoxicity following adverse medical events, including fatal events. We may be unable to submit to the FDA all required clinical follow-up information to respond to the clinical holds. Even if we are able\nto provide such information, the FDA may not deem the information to be sufficient to lift any or all of the clinical holds. In addition, we may encounter delays in reaching an agreement with the FDA regarding the terms under which these trials may be resumed, or we may elect to discontinue one or more of these trials for safety or any other reasons. Furthermore, the FDA may require us to implement additional, potentially burdensome pharmacovigilance procedures or conduct additional pre-clinical studies before it will consider lifting the clinical holds, if at all. In addition, although the FDA has not placed a clinical hold on the CASCADE trial or our phase 1/2 trial in MDS and we continue to enroll patients in these trials, we cannot assure you that the FDA or another regulatory authority will not place a clinical hold on one or both of these trials. If we are unable to submit required information to the FDA in a timely manner, or at all; if the FDA does not lift the clinical holds in a timely manner, or at all; if the FDA does not permit us to initiate additional trials of SGN-CD33A and/or the FDA imposes clinical holds on the CASCADE trial or our phase 1/2 trial in MDS; or if there are additional safety results, including from our ongoing trials of SGN-CD33A, that alter the benefit-risk profile of SGN-CD33A or cause it to become unacceptable, we would be further delayed or prevented from advancing the clinical development of SGN-CD33A, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nEach of our clinical trials requires the investment of substantial expense and time and the timing of the commencement, continuation and completion of these clinical trials may be subject to significant delays relating to various causes, including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria, failure of patients to complete the clinical trial, delays in accumulating the required number of clinical events for data analyses, delay or failure to obtain IRB approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site, and shortages of available drug supply. For example, in accordance with the terms of their respective SPA, the ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 trials are designed to continue until a specified number of events designated for each trial have occurred (i.e. progressions or deaths). If events do not occur at the rate which was anticipated in one or both of these trials, the final data analysis for the applicable trial could be delayed beyond the predicted ranges. In addition, we may choose for a variety of reasons to complete the applicable trial with fewer events than planned. If we choose to complete a trial with fewer events than planned, the FDA may treat the applicable SPA as rescinded and/or the statistical power of that trial based on the original statistical analysis plan could be negatively impacted, making it more difficult for us to demonstrate that ADCETRIS is safe and effective and to successfully obtain regulatory approval for the specific indication studied in that trial. We may also undertake additional discussions with regulatory authorities or amend the protocol for one or both of these trials, and we cannot predict the outcome of those discussions or whether we would be able to reach agreement with the regulatory authorities. Should this situation occur, there could be a delay in our ability to obtain data from the applicable trial or impact the ability of the applicable trial to support approval of ADCETRIS for the specific indication studied in that trial.\nAdditionally, patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the existence of competing clinical trials, perceived side effects and the availability of alternative or new treatments. Many of our future and ongoing ADCETRIS clinical trials are being or will be coordinated with Takeda, which may delay the commencement or affect the continuation or completion of these trials. From time to time, we have experienced enrollment-related delays in clinical trials and we will likely continue to experience similar delays in our current and future trials. We depend on medical institutions and clinical research organizations, or CROs, to conduct some of our clinical trials in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and to the extent they fail to enroll patients for our clinical trials, fail to conduct our trials in accordance with GCP, or are delayed for a significant time in achieving full enrollment, we may be affected by increased costs, program delays or both, which may harm our business. In addition, we conduct clinical trials in foreign countries which may subject us to further delays and expenses as a result of increased drug shipment costs, additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of foreign CROs, as well as expose us to risks associated with less experienced clinical investigators who are unknown to the FDA, different standards of medical care, and foreign currency transactions insofar as changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the foreign currency where the trial is being conducted may impact our actual costs.\nClinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA or other applicable foreign government guidelines and are subject to oversight by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies, the data safety monitoring boards for such trials and the IRBs for the institutions in which such trials are being conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with supplies of ADCETRIS or our product candidates produced under cGMP and other requirements in foreign countries, and may require large numbers of test patients. We, the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies or the applicable data safety monitoring boards and IRBs could delay, suspend, halt or modify our clinical trials of ADCETRIS or any of our product candidates, and we and/or the FDA could terminate or modify any related special protocol assessment, or SPA, agreements, for numerous reasons, including:\n\u2022\nADCETRIS or the applicable product candidate may have unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, including fatalities, or a determination may be made that a clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trial, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, GCP or clinical protocols;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the clinical trial operations or trial sites resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u2022\nthe time required to determine whether ADCETRIS or the applicable product candidate is effective may be longer than expected;\n\u2022\nfatalities or other adverse events arising during a clinical trial due to medical problems that may not be related to clinical trial treatments;\n\u2022\nADCETRIS or the applicable product candidate may not appear to be more effective than current therapies;\n\u2022\nthe quality or stability of ADCETRIS or the applicable product candidate may fall below acceptable standards;\n\u2022\nour inability to produce or obtain sufficient quantities of ADCETRIS or the applicable product candidate to complete the trials;\n\u2022\nour inability to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain IRB approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions that adversely affect our ability to continue to conduct or to complete clinical trials;\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties;\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit and enroll patients to participate in clinical trials for reasons including competition from other clinical trial programs for the same or similar indications;\n\u2022\nour inability to retain patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy or personal issues, or who are lost to further follow-up; or\n\u2022\nour inability to ensure adequate statistical power to detect statistically significant treatment effects, whether through our inability to enroll or retain patients in trials or as a result of our determination to choose to complete trials with fewer events than planned.\nIn addition, we may experience significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials, including unexpected adverse events that may occur when our product candidates are combined with other therapies. For example, on December 27, 2016, we announced that we had received notice from the\nFDA that a full clinical hold or partial clinical hold had been placed on several early stage trials of SGN-CD33A in AML to evaluate the potential risk of hepatotoxicity following adverse medical events, including fatal events. We may be unable to submit to the FDA all required clinical follow-up information to respond to the clinical holds, or even if we are able to provide such information, the FDA may not deem the information to be sufficient to lift any or all of the clinical holds. In addition, we may encounter delays in reaching an agreement with the FDA regarding the terms under which these trials may be resumed, or we may elect to discontinue one or more of these trials for safety or any other reasons. Furthermore, the FDA may require us to implement additional, potentially burdensome pharmacovigilance procedures or conduct additional pre-clinical studies before it will consider lifting the clinical holds, if at all. In addition, although the FDA has not placed a clinical hold on the CASCADE trial or our phase 1/2 trial in MDS and we continue to enroll patients in these trials, we cannot assure you that the FDA or another regulatory authority will not place a clinical hold on one or both of these trials. If we are unable to submit required information to the FDA in a timely manner, or at all; if the FDA does not lift the clinical holds in a timely manner, or at all; if the FDA does not permit us to initiate additional trials of SGN-CD33A and/or the FDA imposes clinical holds on the CASCADE trial or our phase 1/2 trial in MDS; or if there are additional safety results, including from our ongoing trials of SGN-CD33A, that alter the benefit-risk profile of SGN-CD33A or cause it to become unacceptable, we would be further delayed or prevented from advancing the clinical development of SGN-CD33A, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nNegative or inconclusive clinical trial results could adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of our product candidates or to market ADCETRIS and/or expand ADCETRIS into other indications. In particular, negative or inconclusive results in our ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 trials would negatively impact or preclude altogether, our ability to obtain regulatory approval in the frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline MTCL indications, respectively, either of which could limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS. Likewise, the imposition of a clinical hold on, or the termination of, or otherwise negative or inconclusive results in our CASCADE trial, would negatively impact or preclude altogether, our ability to obtain regulatory approval of SGN-CD33A. In addition, clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. For example, although we reported that our ALCANZA trial met its primary endpoint and we plan to submit an sBLA to the FDA to seek approval for a new indication in CD30-expressing relapsed CTCL, regulatory agencies, including the FDA, or their advisors, may disagree with our interpretations of data from the ALCANZA trial and may not approve the expansion of ADCETRIS\u2019 labeled indications of use based on the results of the ALCANZA trial or any other of our clinical trials. Adverse medical events during a clinical trial, including patient fatalities, such as those hepatotoxicity events and patient fatalities observed in certain of our early stage trials of SGN-CD33A resulting in the imposition by the FDA of clinical holds on those trials, could cause a trial to be redone or terminated, curtail or end the development of a product candidate, and may result in other negative consequences to us. Further, some of our clinical trials, including the CASCADE trial, are overseen by an independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, and an IDMC may determine to delay or suspend one or more of these trials due to safety or futility findings based on events occurring during a clinical trial.\nWe face intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Many third parties compete with us in developing various approaches to treating cancer. They include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than we do. In addition, many of these competitors are active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements in anticipation of collecting royalties for use of technology that they have developed. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative\narrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs.\nWith respect to ADCETRIS, there are several other FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma or sALCL, including Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo for Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of auto-HSCT and ADCETRIS and Celgene\u2019s Istodax and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Folotyn for relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Merck is also developing a PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab, and is conducting a clinical trial in relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma comparing pembrolizumab with ADCETRIS. In addition, we are aware of multiple investigational agents that are currently being studied, including Pfizer\u2019s crizotinib, AbbVie\u2019s ibrutinib, Kyowa\u2019s mogamulizumab, and Gilead\u2019s idelalisib, which, if successful, may compete with ADCETRIS in the future. Data have also been presented on several developing technologies, including bispecific antibodies and CAR modified T-cell therapies that may compete with ADCETRIS in the future. Further, there are many competing approaches used in the treatment of patients in ADCETRIS\u2019 three approved indications, including auto-HSCT, conventional therapies, combination chemotherapy, clinical trials with experimental agents and single-agent regimens.\nWith respect to SGN-CD33A, there are several investigational agents that, if approved, could be competitive with our product candidate, including AbbVie\u2019s venetoclax, which received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA in January 2016 for use in combination with HMAs in treatment-na\u00efve patients with AML who are not eligible for standard high-dose induction treatment, Jazz\u2019s Vyxeos, Pfizer\u2019s Mylotarg, Astex\u2019s guadecitabine (SGI-110), and agents targeting biomarkers such as FLT3 and IDH1/2.\nMany other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing and/or marketing therapies for the same types of cancer that our product candidates are designed and being developed to treat. For example, we believe that companies including AbbVie, ADC Therapeutics, Affimed, Agios, Amgen, Astellas, Bayer, Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Eisai, Genentech, GSK, Gilead, ImmunoGen, Immunomedics, Infinity, Karyopharm, MedImmune, MEI Pharma, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Takeda, Teva, and Xencor are developing and/or marketing products or technologies that may compete with ours. In addition, our ADC collaborators may develop compounds utilizing our technology that may compete with product candidates that we are developing.\nWe are aware of other companies that have technologies that may be competitive with ours, including Astellas, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, ImmunoGen, Immunomedics, MedImmune, Mersana and Pfizer, all of which have ADC technology. ImmunoGen has several ADCs in development that may compete with our product candidates. ImmunoGen has also established partnerships with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to allow those other companies to utilize ImmunoGen\u2019s technology, including Sanofi-Aventis, Genentech, Novartis, Takeda and Lilly. We are also aware of a number of companies developing monoclonal antibodies directed at the same antigen targets or for the treatment of the same diseases as our product candidates. For example, we believe Bristol-Myers Squibb has an anti-CD30 antibody program that may be competitive with ADCETRIS, and Amgen and Xencor have anti-CD19 programs that may be competitive with our product candidates.\nIn addition, in the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be \u201chighly similar\u201d or \u201cbiosimilar\u201d to or \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with an FDA-approved biological product. This pathway allows competitors to reference the FDA\u2019s prior approvals regarding innovative biological products and data submitted with a BLA to obtain approval of a biosimilar application 12 years after the time of approval of the innovative biological product. The 12-year exclusivity period runs from the initial approval of the innovator product and not from approval of a new indication. In addition, the 12-year exclusivity period does not prevent another company from independently developing a product that is highly similar to the innovative product, generating all the data necessary for a full BLA and seeking approval. Exclusivity only assures that another company cannot rely on the FDA\u2019s prior\napprovals in approving a BLA for an innovator\u2019s biological product to support the biosimilar product\u2019s approval. Further, under the FDA\u2019s current interpretation, it is possible that a biosimilar applicant could obtain approval for one or more of the indications approved for the innovator product by extrapolating clinical data from one indication to support approval for other indications. The FDA approved the first biosimilar product in the United States in May 2015. In the European Union, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued since 2005. We are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology and other companies that are actively engaged in research and development of biosimilars or interchangeable products.\nIt is possible that our competitors will succeed in developing technologies that are more effective than ADCETRIS, SGN-CD33A or our other product candidates or that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive, or will succeed in developing biosimilar or interchangeable products for ADCETRIS, SGN-CD33A or our other product candidates. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter our market and scientific developments surrounding biosimilars and other cancer therapies continue to accelerate. We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilars or other competing products will impact potential future sales of ADCETRIS, SGN-CD33A or our other product candidates.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate. If our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our stock could decline.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. In addition, although we provide sales guidance for ADCETRIS from time to time, you should not rely on ADCETRIS sales results in any period as being indicative of future performance. Such guidance is based on assumptions that may be incorrect or that may change from quarter to quarter. Sales of ADCETRIS have, on occasion, been below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and have been below prior period sales, and sales of ADCETRIS in the future may also be below prior period sales, our own guidance and/or the expectations of securities analysts and investors. To the extent that we do not meet our guidance or the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price may be adversely impacted, perhaps significantly. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\ncustomer ordering patterns for ADCETRIS, which may vary significantly from period to period;\n\u2022\nthe overall level of demand for ADCETRIS including the impact of any competitive or biosimilar products and the duration of therapy for patients receiving ADCETRIS;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which coverage and reimbursement for ADCETRIS is available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers, managed care programs and other third-party payers;\n\u2022\nchanges in the amount of deductions from gross sales, including government-mandated rebates, chargebacks and discounts that can vary because of changes to the government discount percentage, including increases in the government discount percentage resulting from price increases we have taken or may take in the future, or due to different levels of utilization by entities entitled to government rebates and discounts and changes in patient demographics;\n\u2022\nincreases in the scope of eligibility for customers to purchase ADCETRIS at the discounted government price or to obtain government-mandated rebates on purchases of ADCETRIS;\n\u2022\nchanges in our cost of sales;\n\u2022\nthe incidence rate of new patients in ADCETRIS\u2019 approved indications;\n\u2022\nthe timing, cost and level of investment in our sales and marketing efforts to support ADCETRIS sales;\n\u2022\nthe timing, cost and level of investment in our research and development and other activities involving ADCETRIS, SGN-CD33A and our other product candidates by us or our collaborators;\n\u2022\nexpenditures we will or may incur to develop and/or commercialize any additional products, product candidates, or technologies that we may develop, in-license, or acquire.\nIn addition, we have entered into licensing and collaboration agreements with other companies that include development funding and milestone payments to us, and we expect that amounts earned from our collaboration agreements will continue to be an important source of our revenues. Accordingly, our revenues will also depend on development funding and the achievement of development and clinical milestones under our existing collaboration and license agreements, including, in particular, our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda, as well as entering into potential new collaboration and license agreements. These upfront and milestone payments may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and any such variance could cause a significant fluctuation in our operating results from one quarter to the next.\nFurther, changes in our operations, such as increased development, manufacturing and clinical trial expenses in connection with our expanding pipeline programs, including several phase 3 trials, or our undertaking of additional programs, business activities or entry into strategic transactions, including potential additional acquisitions of products, technologies or businesses, such as our anticipated in-licensing of IMMU-132, may also cause significant fluctuations in our expenses. In addition, we measure compensation cost for stock-based awards made to employees at the grant date of the award, based on the fair value of the award, and recognize the cost as an expense over the employee\u2019s requisite service period. As the variables that we use as a basis for valuing these awards change over time, including our underlying stock price, the magnitude of the expense that we must recognize may vary significantly. Additionally, we have implemented long-term incentive plans for our employees, and the incentives provided under these plans are contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. Costs of performance-based compensation under our long-term incentive plans are not recorded as an expense until the achievement of the applicable milestones is deemed probable of being met, which may result in large fluctuations to the expense we must recognize in any particular period.\nFor these and other reasons, it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future sales of ADCETRIS, collaboration and license agreement revenues, royalty revenues, operating expenses or future profits or losses. As a result, our operating results in future periods could be below our guidance or the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, perhaps substantially.\nWe have a history of net losses. We expect to continue to incur net losses and may not achieve profitability for some time, if at all.\nWe have incurred substantial net losses in each of our years of operation. We have incurred these losses principally from costs incurred in our research and development programs and from our selling, general and administrative expenses. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on research and development, including amounts for conducting required post-approval and other clinical trials of, and seeking additional regulatory approvals for, ADCETRIS as well as commercializing ADCETRIS for the treatment of patients in its three approved indications. In addition, we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and potentially commercialize SGN-CD33A and our other product candidates. Likewise, in connection with our anticipated in-licensing of IMMU-132, we expect to incur substantial upfront and milestone payment obligations and to make to make substantial expenditures to potentially further develop and potentially commercialize IMMU-132. Accordingly, we expect to continue to incur net losses and may not achieve profitability for some time, if at all. Although we recognize revenue from ADCETRIS product sales and we continue to earn amounts under our collaboration agreements, our revenue and profit potential is unproven and our limited commercialization history makes our future operating results difficult to predict. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline.\nWe depend on collaborative relationships with other companies to assist in the research and development of ADCETRIS and for the development and commercialization of product candidates utilizing or incorporating our technologies. If we are not able to locate suitable collaborators or if our collaborators do not perform as expected, this may negatively affect our ability to commercialize ADCETRIS, develop other product candidates and/or generate revenues through technology licensing, or may otherwise negatively affect our business.\nWe have established collaborations with third parties to develop and market ADCETRIS and some of our current and future product candidates. For example, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda in December 2009 that granted Takeda rights to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS outside of the United States and Canada. In addition, we have entered into a 50/50 co-development agreement with Astellas for the development of ADCs, including ASG-22ME. We also have ADC collaborations with AbbVie, Bayer, Celldex, Genentech, GSK, Pfizer and Progenics, and an ADC co-development agreement with Genmab. In addition, we have entered into a collaboration agreement with Unum to develop and commercialize novel antibody-coupled T-cell receptor, or ACTR, therapies incorporating our antibodies for cancer. Our dependence on collaborative arrangements to assist in the development and commercialization of ADCETRIS and for the development and commercialization of product candidates utilizing or incorporating our technologies subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nwe are not able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators or co-development partners devote to the development or commercialization of products and product candidates utilizing or incorporating our technologies, or to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and our collaborators or co-development partners that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of the applicable products and product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\nwith respect to collaboration and co-development arrangements under which we have an active role, such as our ADCETRIS collaboration and our 50/50 co-development agreement with Astellas, we may have differing opinions or priorities than our collaborators or co-development partners, or we may encounter challenges in joint decision making, which may result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of the applicable products and product candidates, including ADCETRIS and ASG-22ME;\n\u2022\nour current and potential future collaborators and co-development partners may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\nsignificant delays in the development of product candidates by current and potential collaborators and co-development partners could allow competitors to bring products to market before product candidates utilizing or incorporating our technologies are approved and impair the ability of current and potential future collaborators and co-development partners to effectively commercialize these product candidates;\n\u2022\nour relationships with our collaborators and co-development partners may divert significant time and effort of our scientific staff and management team and require the effective allocation of our resources to multiple internal, collaborative and co-development projects;\n\u2022\nour current and potential future collaborators and co-development partners may not be successful in their efforts to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nour current and potential future collaborators and co-development partners may receive regulatory sanctions relating to other aspects of their business that could adversely affect the development, approval or commercialization of the applicable products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nour current and potential future collaborators and co-development partners may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s or co-development partner\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect such party\u2019s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement;\n\u2022\na collaborator or co-development partner could independently move forward with competing products, therapeutic approaches or technologies to develop treatments for the diseases targeted by us or our collaborators or co-development partners that are developed by such collaborator or co-development partner either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors;\n\u2022\nour current and potential collaborators and co-development partners may experience financial difficulties; and\n\u2022\nour collaborations and co-development agreements may be terminated, breached or allowed to expire, or our collaborators or co-development partners may reduce the scope of our agreements with them, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position by reducing or eliminating the potential for us to receive technology access and license fees, milestones and royalties, and/or reimbursement of development costs, and which could require us to devote additional efforts and to incur the additional costs associated with pursuing internal development and commercialization of the applicable products and product candidates.\nIf our collaborative or co-development arrangements are not successful as a result of any of the above factors, or any other factors, then our ability to advance the development and commercialization of the applicable products and product candidates and to otherwise generate revenue from these arrangements and to become profitable will be adversely affected, and our business and business prospects may be materially harmed. In particular, if Takeda were to terminate the ADCETRIS collaboration, we would not receive milestone payments, co-funded development payments or royalties for the sale of ADCETRIS outside the United States and Canada. As a result of such termination, we may have to engage another collaborator to complete the ADCETRIS development process and to commercialize ADCETRIS outside the United States and Canada, or to complete the development process and undertake commercializing ADCETRIS outside the United States and Canada ourselves, either of which could significantly delay the continued development and commercialization of ADCETRIS and increase our costs. In turn, this could significantly harm our financial position, adversely affect our stock price and require us to incur all the costs of developing and commercializing ADCETRIS, which are now being co-funded by Takeda.\nIn the future, we may not be able to locate third-party collaborators or co-development partners to develop and market products and product candidates utilizing or incorporating our technologies, and we may lack the capital and resources necessary to develop and market these products and product candidates alone.\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in strategic transactions that increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks.\nWe actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or otherwise acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses, and we recently announced our entry into the Immunomedics License pursuant to which, if consummated, we would be granted an exclusive worldwide license to IMMU-132. Any potential acquisitions or in-licensing transactions, such as our anticipated in-licensing of IMMU-132, may entail numerous risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nrisks associated with satisfying the closing conditions relating to such transactions and realizing their anticipated benefits;\n\u2022\nincreased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating acquired technologies, products, operations, and personnel with our existing business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention in connection with both negotiating the acquisition or license and integrating the business, technology or product;\n\u2022\nretention of key employees;\n\u2022\nuncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships of any acquired entities;\n\u2022\nstrain on managerial and operational resources;\n\u2022\ndifficulty implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting at businesses that we acquire, particularly if they are not located near our existing operations;\n\u2022\nexposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies or companies in which we invest; and\n\u2022\npotential costly and time-consuming litigation, including stockholder lawsuits.\nAs a result of these or other problems and risks, businesses, technologies or products we acquire or invest in or obtain licenses to may not produce the revenues, earnings or business synergies that we anticipated, acquired or licensed technologies may not result in regulatory approvals, and acquired or licensed products may not perform as expected. As a result, we may incur higher costs and realize lower revenues than we had anticipated. We cannot assure you that any acquisitions or investments we have made or may make in the future, including our anticipated in-licensing of IMMU-132, will be completed or that, if completed, the acquired business, licenses, investments, products, or technologies will generate sufficient revenue to offset the negative costs or other negative effects on our business. Failure to manage effectively our growth through acquisition or in-licensing transactions could adversely affect our growth prospects, business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow.\nIn addition, we may spend significant amounts, issue dilutive securities, assume or incur significant debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets in connection with acquisitions and in-licensing transactions that could result in significant future amortization expense and write-offs. Moreover, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business. Even if appropriate opportunities are available, we may not be able to successfully identify them or we may not have the financial resources necessary to pursue them, and if pursued, we may be unable to structure and execute transactions in the anticipated timeframe, or at all. Other pharmaceutical companies, many of which may have substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, compete with us for these opportunities.\nEven if we are able to successfully identify and acquire complementary products, technologies or businesses, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with integrating acquired products, technologies or businesses or the risks arising from anticipated and unanticipated problems in connection with an acquisition or in-licensing transaction. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of potential acquisitions and in-licensing transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. Any failure in identifying and managing these risks and uncertainties effectively, including in connection with the anticipated in-licensing of IMMU-132, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, including the possibility that expected synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time frame.\nOur current product candidates are in various stages of clinical development, and it is possible that none of these product candidates will ever become commercial products.\nOur current product candidates are in various stages of clinical development, and other than SGN-CD33A, our product candidates are in relatively early stages of development. Our product candidates will require significant further development, financial resources and personnel to obtain regulatory approval and develop into commercially viable products, if at all. In 2016, we initiated the CASCADE trial, which is designed to evaluate SGN-CD33A in combination with HMAs in previously untreated older AML patients. SGN-CD33A has not\npreviously been evaluated in a randomized trial with other active agents and we cannot be certain that the design of, or data collected from, the CASCADE trial will be adequate to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of SGN-CD33A for the treatment of patients with AML, or will otherwise be sufficient to support FDA or any foreign regulatory approvals. In addition, certain early stage trials of SGN-CD33A are currently under clinical holds to evaluate the potential risk of hepatotoxicity following adverse medical events, including fatal events. We may be unable to submit to the FDA all required clinical follow-up information to respond to the clinical holds. Even if we are able to provide such information, the FDA may not deem the information to be sufficient to lift any or all of the clinical holds. In addition, we may encounter delays in reaching an agreement with the FDA regarding the terms under which these trials may be resumed, or we may elect to discontinue one or more of these trials for safety or any other reasons. Furthermore, the FDA may require us to implement additional, potentially burdensome pharmacovigilance procedures or conduct additional pre-clinical studies before it will consider lifting the clinical holds, if at all. In addition, although the FDA has not placed a clinical hold on the CASCADE trial or our phase 1/2 trial in MDS and we continue to enroll patients in these trials, we cannot assure you that the FDA or another regulatory authority will not place a clinical hold on one or both of these trials. If we are unable to submit required information to the FDA in a timely manner, or at all; if the FDA does not lift the clinical holds in a timely manner, or at all; if the FDA does not permit us to initiate additional trials of SGN-CD33A and/or the FDA imposes clinical holds on the CASCADE trial or our phase 1/2 trial in MDS, or if there are additional safety results, including from our ongoing trials of SGN-CD33A that alter the benefit-risk profile of SGN-CD33A or cause it to become unacceptable, we would be further delayed or prevented from advancing the clinical development of SGN-CD33A, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nCurrently, our other clinical-stage product candidates include seven ADC programs, which consist of ASG-22ME, SGN-LIV1A, SGN-CD19A, SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A, SGN-352A, and ASG-15ME, as well as two immuno-oncology agents, SEA-CD40, which is based on our sugar-engineered antibody, or SEA, technology, and SGN-2FF, which is a novel small molecule. If a product candidate fails at any stage of development or we otherwise determine to discontinue development of that product candidate, we will not have the anticipated revenues from that product candidate to fund our operations, and we may not receive any return on our investment in that product candidate. Moreover, we still have only limited data from our phase 1 trials of our product candidates. In this regard, preclinical studies and any encouraging or positive preliminary and interim data from our clinical trials of our product candidates may not necessarily be predictive of the results of ongoing or later clinical trials. Even if we are able to complete our planned clinical trials of our product candidates according to our current development timeline, the encouraging or positive results from clinical trials of our product candidates in earlier stage trials may not be replicated in subsequent clinical trial results. As a result, we may conduct lengthy and expensive clinical trials of our product candidates only to learn that a product candidate is not an effective treatment or is not superior to existing approved therapies, or has an unacceptable safety profile, which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval for such product candidate. Also, our later-stage clinical trials could differ in significant ways from earlier stage clinical trials, which could cause the outcome of the later-stage trials to differ from our earlier stage clinical trials. For instance, though we reported phase 1 interim efficacy data that supported our decision to initiate the CASCADE trial, we may not receive positive results for SGN-CD33A even if we complete the CASCADE trial. Differences in earlier and later stage clinical trials may include changes to inclusion and exclusion criteria, efficacy endpoints and statistical design. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including us, have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving encouraging or positive results in early-stage development. We cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks in our ongoing clinical trials, for instance, in the CASCADE trial. We have not yet completed any late-stage clinical trials for our current product candidates, and if we fail to produce positive results in our ongoing or planned clinical trials of any of our product candidates, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for our product candidates, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, would be materially adversely affected.\nDue to the uncertain and time-consuming clinical development and regulatory approval process, we may not successfully develop any of our product candidates and it is possible that none of our current product candidates will ever become commercial products. In addition, we expect that much of our effort and many of our\nexpenditures over the next few years will be devoted to the additional clinical development of and commercialization activities associated with ADCETRIS, which may restrict or delay our ability to develop our clinical and preclinical product candidates.\nTo date, we have depended on a small number of collaborators for a substantial portion of our revenue. The loss of any one of these collaborators or changes in their product development or business strategy could result in a material decline in our revenue.\nWe have collaborations with a limited number of companies. To date, a substantial portion of our revenue has resulted from payments made under agreements with our corporate collaborators, and although ADCETRIS sales currently comprise a greater proportion of our revenue, we expect that a portion of our revenue will continue to come from corporate collaborations. Even though we market ADCETRIS in the United States and Canada, our revenues still depend in part on Takeda\u2019s ability and willingness to market ADCETRIS outside of the United States and Canada. The loss of our collaborators, especially Takeda, changes in product development or business strategies of our collaborators, or the failure of our collaborators to perform their obligations under their agreements with us for any reason, including paying license or technology fees, milestone payments, royalties or reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Payments under our existing and potential future collaboration agreements are also subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount, which could cause our revenue to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and cause a decrease in our stock price.\nWe are dependent upon a small number of distributors for a significant portion of our net sales, and the loss of, or significant reduction or cancellation in sales to, any one of these distributors could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nIn the United States and Canada, we sell ADCETRIS through a limited number of pharmaceutical distributors. Customers order ADCETRIS through these distributors. We generally receive orders from distributors and ship product directly to the customer. We do not promote ADCETRIS to these distributors and they do not set or determine demand for ADCETRIS; however, our ability to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS will depend, in part, on the performance of these distributors. Although we believe we can find alternative distributors on relatively short notice, the loss of a major distributor could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently rely on third-party manufacturers and other third parties for production of our drug products and our dependence on these manufacturers may impair the continued development and commercialization of ADCETRIS.\nWe do not currently have the internal ability to manufacture the drug products that we sell or need to conduct our clinical trials, and we therefore rely on corporate collaborators and contract manufacturing organizations to supply drug product for commercial supply and our IND-enabling studies and clinical trials. For the monoclonal antibody used in ADCETRIS, we have contracted with AbbVie for clinical and commercial supplies. For the drug linker used in ADCETRIS, we have contracted with Sigma Aldrich Fine Chemicals, or SAFC, for clinical and commercial supplies. We have multiple contract manufacturers for conjugating the drug linker to the antibody and producing the ADCETRIS product. For our ADC product candidates, multiple contract manufacturers, including AbbVie and SAFC, perform antibody and drug-linker manufacturing and several other contract manufacturers perform conjugation of the drug-linker to the antibody and fill/finish of the drug product. In addition, we rely on other third parties to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process, including shipping and storage of ADCETRIS and our product candidates. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce, vial and store sufficient quantities of ADCETRIS for use in our clinical trials and for commercial sale. If our contract manufacturers or other third parties fail to deliver ADCETRIS for clinical use or sale on a timely basis, with sufficient quality, and at commercially reasonable prices, and we fail to find replacement manufacturers or to develop our own manufacturing capabilities, we may be required to delay or suspend clinical trials or otherwise discontinue development, production and sale of ADCETRIS. Moreover, contract manufacturers have a limited number of\nfacilities in which ADCETRIS can be produced and any interruption of the operation of those facilities due to events such as equipment malfunction or failure or damage to the facility by natural disasters or as the result of regulatory actions could result in the cancellation of shipments, loss of product in the manufacturing process, a shortfall in ADCETRIS supply, or the inability to sell our products in the U.S. or abroad. In addition, we have committed to provide Takeda with their needs of certain parts of the ADCETRIS supply chain for a limited period of time, which may require us to arrange for additional manufacturing supply. Moreover, we depend on outside vendors for the supply of raw materials used to produce ADCETRIS. If the third-party suppliers were to cease production or otherwise fail to supply us with quality raw materials and we were unable to contract on acceptable terms for these raw materials with alternative suppliers, our ability to have ADCETRIS manufactured to meet commercial and clinical requirements would be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various state and federal laws and regulations, including healthcare laws and regulations, that may impact our business and could subject us to significant fines and penalties or other negative consequences.\nOur operations may be directly or indirectly subject to various state and federal healthcare laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, federal civil and criminal false claims laws, HIPAA/HITECH, the federal civil monetary penalties statute, and the federal transparency requirements under the PPACA. These laws may impact, among other things, the sales, marketing and education programs for ADCETRIS.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willingly soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. Additionally, PPACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.\nThe federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from or approval by the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Suits filed under the civil False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have recently been investigated or subject to lawsuits by whistleblowers and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing or other activities, including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees, grants, free travel, and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company\u2019s products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug reimbursement rates under government healthcare programs.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to\nexecute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, PPACA amended the intent requirement of the criminal healthcare fraud statutes such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or intent to violate it.\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, governs certain types of individuals and entities with respect to the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and imposes certain obligations with respect to the security and privacy of protected health information.\nThe federal civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.\nThe federal transparency requirements under PPACA, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to annually report to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and physician ownership and investment interests.\nThere are foreign and state law equivalents of these laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback, false claims, and data privacy and security laws, to which we are currently and/or may in the future, be subject. We may also be subject to state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Many of these state laws differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThe FDA and other governmental authorities also actively investigate allegations of off-label promotion activities in order to enforce regulations prohibiting these types of activities. In recent years, private whistleblowers have also pursued False Claims Act cases against a number of pharmaceutical companies for causing false claims to be submitted as a result of off-label promotion. If we are found to have promoted an approved product, including ADCETRIS, for off-label uses we may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative financial penalties and other remedies as well as criminal financial penalties and other sanctions. Even when a company is not determined to have engaged in off-label promotion, the allegation from government authorities or market participants that a company has engaged in such activities could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s sales, business and financial condition. The U.S. government has also required companies to enter into complex corporate integrity agreements and/or non-prosecution agreements that impose significant reporting and other burdens on the affected companies.\nWe are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations that are not specific to the healthcare industry. For instance, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits companies and individuals from engaging in specified activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under the FCPA, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, governmental staff members, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.\nThe number and complexity of both U.S. federal and state laws continue to increase. In addition to enforcement by governmental agencies, we also expect a continuation of the trend of private plaintiff lawsuits\nagainst pharmaceutical manufacturers under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act and state equivalents or other laws and regulations such as securities rules and the evolution of new theories of liability under those statutes. Government agencies will likely continue to intervene in such private whistleblower lawsuits and such intervention typically raises the company\u2019s cost significantly. For example, federal enforcement agencies have recently scrutinized product and patient assistance programs, including manufacturer reimbursement support services as well as relationships with specialty pharmacies. Several investigations have resulted in government enforcement authorities intervening in related whistleblower lawsuits and obtaining significant civil and criminal settlements.\nIn order to comply with these laws, we have implemented a comprehensive compliance program to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and by promoting a culture of compliance. Although we take our obligation to maintain our compliance with these various laws and regulations seriously and our compliance program is designed to prevent the violation of these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that our compliance program will be sufficient or effective, that our employees will comply with our policies and that our employees will notify us of any violation of our policies, that we will have the ability to take appropriate and timely corrective action in response to any such violation, or that we will make decisions and take actions that will necessarily limit or avoid liability for whistleblower claims that individuals, such as employees or former employees, may bring against us or that governmental authorities may prosecute against us based on information provided by individuals. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations described above or other applicable state and federal healthcare laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, imprisonment, diminished profits and future earnings, exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws is costly and time-consuming for our management.\nAs we expand our operations internationally, we are subject to an increased risk of conducting activities in a manner that violates applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws. We are also subject to foreign laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. These laws and regulations could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, and we currently have subsidiaries in the U.K., Switzerland and Canada. Though we are at an early stage with our international expansion, our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA, which is described above, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we currently and may in the future operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act. The U.K. Bribery Act prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes to any person, including non-U.K. government officials and private persons, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person. In addition, under the U.K. Bribery Act, companies which carry on a business or part of a business in the U.K. may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including non-U.K. government officials and private persons, by employees and persons associated with such company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for such company. In the course of expanding our operations internationally, we will need to establish and expand business relationships with various third parties, such as independent contractors, distributors, vendors, advocacy groups and physicians, and we will interact more frequently with foreign officials, including regulatory authorities and physicians employed by state-run healthcare institutions who may be deemed to be foreign officials under the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act or similar laws of other countries that may govern our activities. Any interactions with any such parties or individuals where compensation is provided that are found to be in violation of such laws could result in substantial fines and penalties and could materially harm our business. Furthermore, any finding of a violation\nunder one country\u2019s laws may increase the likelihood that we will be prosecuted and be found to have violated another country\u2019s laws. If our business practices outside the United States are found to be in violation of the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act or other similar laws, we may be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. We are also subject to foreign laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. In this regard, European Union member states and other foreign jurisdictions, including Switzerland, have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. Failure to comply with these laws could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAny failures or further setbacks in our ADC development program would negatively affect our business and financial position.\nADCETRIS and our SGN-CD33A, ASG-22ME, SGN-LIV1A, SGN-CD19A, SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A, SGN-CD352A, and ASG-15ME product candidates are all based on our ADC technology, which utilizes proprietary stable linkers and potent cell-killing synthetic agents. Our ADC technology is also the basis of our collaborations with AbbVie, Astellas, Bayer, Celldex, Genentech, GSK, Pfizer, and Progenics, and our co-development agreements with Takeda, Astellas, and Genmab. Although ADCETRIS has received marketing approval in the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan and other countries, ADCETRIS is our first and only ADC product that has been approved for commercial sale in any jurisdiction. Any failures or further setbacks in our ADC development program, including adverse effects resulting from the use of this technology in human clinical trials and/or the imposition of additional clinical holds on our trials of SGN-CD33A or any of our other product candidates, could have a detrimental impact on the continued commercialization of ADCETRIS in its current or any potential future approved indications and on our internal product candidate pipeline, as well as our ability to maintain and/or enter into new corporate collaborations regarding our ADC technology, which would negatively affect our business and financial position.\nWe have been named a defendant in a purported securities class action lawsuit and a lawsuit in connection with the Immunomedics License. This, and potential similar or related litigation, could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nOn January 10, 2017, a purported securities class action lawsuit was commenced in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, naming as defendants us and certain of our officers. The lawsuit alleges material misrepresentations and omissions in public statements regarding our business, operational and compliance policies, violations by all named defendants of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks compensatory damages of an undisclosed amount. The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that we made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that SGN-CD33A presents a significant risk of fatal hepatotoxicity and that we had therefore overstated the viability of SGN-CD33A as a treatment for AML. It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from stockholders, with respect to these same matters and also naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants.\nIn addition, on February 13, 2017, we were named a co-defendant in a lawsuit filed by venBio in the Delaware Chancery Court against the members of the board of directors of Immunomedics. The lawsuit, or the venBio lawsuit, alleges that the members of the Immunomedics board breached their fiduciary duties toward their stockholders by hastily licensing IMMU-132 to us. We are alleged to have aided and abetted the breach of fiduciary duties. Among other things, venBio seeks to enjoin the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. As a result of the pending litigation challenging the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License, Immunomedics and we have committed to the Court not to close the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License prior to March 10, 2017. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of the venBio lawsuit or the impact it may have on the Immunomedics License or the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. However, it is possible that, in connection with the venBio lawsuit, the Immunomedics License could be rescinded or reformed in a way that is disadvantageous to us, including by\nrequiring us to increase the transaction consideration payable to Immunomedics under the Immunomedics License, or that otherwise adversely affects the anticipated benefits to us of the Immunomedics License.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously. These lawsuits and any other related lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual costs to be incurred relating to the lawsuits will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcome of the litigation is necessarily uncertain, and we could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these suits, and we may not prevail. Monitoring and defending against legal actions is time-consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities, which could result in delays of our clinical trials or our development and commercialization efforts. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with the litigation. We are also generally obligated, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify our current and former directors and officers who are named as defendants in these and similar lawsuits. We are not currently able to estimate the possible cost to us from this matter, as these lawsuits are currently at an early stage and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve these matters or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to pay. We have not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to these lawsuits. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. Decisions adverse to our interests in these lawsuits could result in the payment of substantial damages, or possibly fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial position. Decisions adverse to our interests in the venBio lawsuit could also result in the termination of the Immunomedics License or otherwise frustrate our ability to, or increase our costs to, consummate the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. In addition, the uncertainty of the currently pending litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price.\nWe may need to raise significant amounts of additional capital that may not be available to us.\nWe expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees, support our preclinical development, manufacturing and clinical trial activities for ADCETRIS and our other pipeline programs, and expand internationally, as well as commercialize ADCETRIS and position ADCETRIS for potential additional regulatory approvals. In addition, we anticipate committing substantial capital resources to the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License and the anticipated transfer, integration and development activities related to IMMU-132, including with respect to our upfront and milestone payment obligations to Immunomedics. Our commitment of resources to the continuing development, regulatory and commercialization activities for ADCETRIS, the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License and the anticipated transfer, integration and development activities related to IMMU-132, and the research, continued development and manufacturing of our product candidates will likely require us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital. In addition, we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or otherwise acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses, such as our anticipated in-licensing of IMMU-132, and we may require significant additional capital in order to complete or otherwise provide funding for any additional acquisitions. We may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods: corporate collaborations, licensing arrangements, and public or private debt or equity financings. We do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs, which may adversely affect our business and operations. Our future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of sales and market acceptance of ADCETRIS;\n\u2022\nthe rate of progress and cost of the confirmatory post-approval study that we are required to conduct as a condition to the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval of ADCETRIS in the relapsed sALCL indication;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals of ADCETRIS in additional indications, if any;\n\u2022\nthe size, complexity, timing, progress and number of our clinical programs;\n\u2022\nthe timing, receipt and amount of milestone-based payments or other revenue from our collaborations or license arrangements, including royalty revenue generated from commercial sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda;\n\u2022\nthe cost of establishing and maintaining clinical and commercial supplies of ADCETRIS;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with acquisitions or licenses of additional technologies, products, or companies, as well as licenses we may need to commercialize our products, including the actual costs to us of our anticipated in-licensing of IMMU-132;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any future collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022\nexpenses associated with the pending and potential additional related purported securities class action lawsuits, as well as any other potential litigation;\n\u2022\nthe potential costs associated with international, state and federal taxes; and\n\u2022\ncompeting technological and market developments.\nIn addition, changes in our spending rate may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner, such as increased development, manufacturing and clinical trial expenses in connection with our expanding pipeline programs, including several phase 3 trials, or our undertaking of additional programs, business activities or entry into strategic transactions, including potential additional acquisitions of products, technologies or businesses such as our anticipated in-licensing of IMMU-132. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nDuring the past several years, domestic and international financial markets have experienced extreme disruption from time to time, including, among other things, high volatility and significant declines in stock prices and severely diminished liquidity and credit availability for both borrowers and investors. For example, in June 2016, the electorate in the U.K. voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty. The U.K. government has announced that it intends to deliver a notice of withdrawal by the end of March 2017. It is likely that the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union will involve a process of lengthy negotiations between the U.K and European Union member states to determine the future terms of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the European Union. This could lead to a period of considerable uncertainty, particularly in relation to global financial markets which in turn could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. Such adverse capital and credit market conditions could make it more difficult to obtain additional capital on favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.\nWe rely on license agreements for certain aspects of ADCETRIS and our ADC technology. Failure to maintain these license agreements or to secure any required new licenses could prevent us from continuing to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS and our product candidates.\nWe have entered into agreements with third-party commercial and academic institutions to license technology for use in ADCETRIS and our ADC technology. Currently, we have license agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb and the University of Miami, among others. In addition to royalty provisions, some of these license agreements contain diligence and milestone-based termination provisions, in which case our failure to meet any agreed upon royalty or diligence requirements or milestones may allow the licensor to terminate the agreement. Many of our license agreements grant us exclusive licenses to the underlying technologies. If our licensors terminate our license agreements or if we are unable to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive license agreements, we may be unable to continue to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS or our product candidates.\nFurther, we have had in the past, and may in the future have, disputes with our licensors, which may impact our ability to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS or our product candidates or require us to enter into additional licenses. An adverse result in potential future disputes with our licensors may impact our ability to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS and our product candidates, or may require us to enter into additional licenses or to incur additional costs in litigation or settlement. In addition, continued development and commercialization of ADCETRIS and our product candidates will likely require us to secure licenses to additional technologies. We may not be able to secure these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nIf we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights or if we fail to sustain and further build our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to successfully commercialize ADCETRIS or future products and competitors may be able to develop competing therapies.\nOur success depends, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and successfully enforcing these patents and defending them against third-party challenges in the United States and other countries. We own multiple U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications for our technologies. We also have rights to issued U.S. patents, patent applications, and their foreign counterparts, relating to our monoclonal antibody, linker and drug-based technologies. Our rights to these patents and patent applications are derived in part from worldwide licenses from third parties. In addition, we have licensed certain of our U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications to third parties.\nThe standards that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent offices use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Consequently, our pending patent applications may not be allowed and, if allowed, may not contain the type and extent of patent claims that will be adequate to conduct our business as planned. Additionally, any issued patents we currently own or obtain in the future may have a shorter patent term than expected or may not contain claims that will permit us to stop competitors from using our technology or similar technology or from copying our products. Similarly, the standards that courts use to interpret patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and may evolve, particularly as new technologies develop. In addition, changes to patent laws in the United States or other countries may be applied retroactively to affect the validation enforceability, or term of our patent. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently modified some legal standards applied by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examination of U.S. patent applications, which may decrease the likelihood that we will be able to obtain patents and may increase the likelihood of challenges to patents we obtain or license. In addition, changes to the U.S. patent system have come into force under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, including changes from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system, changes to examination of U.S. patent applications and changes to the processes for challenging issued patents. These changes include provisions that affect the way patent applications are being filed, prosecuted and litigated. For example, the America Invents Act enacted proceedings involving post-issuance patent review procedures, such as inter partes review, or IPR, and post-grant review and covered business methods. These proceedings are conducted before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. Each proceeding has different eligibility criteria and different patentability challenges that can be raised. In this regard, the IPR process permits any person (except a party who has been litigating the patent for more than a year) to challenge the validity of some patents on the grounds that it was anticipated or made obvious by prior art. As a result, non-practicing entities associated with hedge funds, pharmaceutical companies who may be our competitors and others have challenged certain valuable pharmaceutical U.S. patents based on prior art through the IPR process. A decision in such a proceeding adverse to our interests could result in the loss of valuable patent rights which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In any event, the America Invents Act and any other potential future changes to the U.S. patent system could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets and other proprietary information are difficult to protect. We\nhave taken measures to protect our unpatented trade secrets and know-how, including the use of confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements with our employees, consultants and certain contractors. It is possible, however, that these persons may breach the agreements or that our competitors may independently develop or otherwise discover our trade secrets or other proprietary information. Our research collaborators may publish confidential data or other restricted information to which we have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations, then our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information may be impaired.\nWe may incur substantial costs and lose important rights or may not be able to continue to commercialize ADCETRIS or to commercialize any of our product candidates that may be approved for commercial sale as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights, and we may be required to obtain patent and other intellectual property rights from others.\nWe may face potential lawsuits by companies, academic institutions or others alleging infringement of their intellectual property. Because patent applications can take a few years to publish, there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that adversely affect the continued commercialization of ADCETRIS or future commercialization of our product candidates in development. In addition, we are monitoring the progress of multiple pending patent applications of other organizations that, if granted, may require us to license or challenge their enforceability in order to continue commercializing ADCETRIS or to commercialize our product candidates that may be approved for commercial sale. Our challenges to patents of other organizations may not be successful, which may affect our ability to commercialize ADCETRIS or our product candidates. As a result of the patent infringement lawsuits that have been filed or may be filed against us in the future by third parties alleging infringement by us of patent or other intellectual property rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including lost profits, royalties, treble damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, the results may be unpredictable. In addition, defending lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Further, we may be stopped from developing, manufacturing or selling our products until we obtain a license from the owner of the relevant technology or other intellectual property rights, or be forced to undertake costly design-arounds, if feasible. If such a license is available at all, it may require us to pay substantial royalties or other fees.\nWe are or may be from time to time involved in the defense and enforcement of our patent or other intellectual property rights in a court of law, USPTO interference, IPR, post-grant review or reexamination proceeding, foreign opposition proceeding or related legal and administrative proceeding in the United States and elsewhere. In addition, if we choose to go to court to stop a third party from infringing our patents, that third party has the right to ask the court to rule that these patents are invalid, not infringed and/or should not be enforced. Under the America Invents Act, a third party may also have the option to challenge the validity of certain patents at the PTAB, whether they are accused of infringing our patents or not, and certain entities associated with hedge funds, pharmaceutical companies and other entities have challenged valuable pharmaceutical patents through the IPR process. These lawsuits and administrative proceedings are expensive and consume time and other resources, and we may not be successful in these proceedings or in stopping infringement. In addition, there is a risk that a court will decide that these patents are not valid or not infringed or otherwise not enforceable, or that the PTAB will decide that certain patents are not valid or should have a shorter term, and that we do not have the right to stop a third party from using the patented subject matter. Successful challenges to our patent or other intellectual property rights through these proceedings could result in a loss of rights in the relevant jurisdiction and may allow third parties to use our proprietary technologies without a license from us or our collaborators, which may also result in loss of future royalty payments. Furthermore, if such challenges to our rights are not resolved promptly in our favor, our existing business relationships may be jeopardized and we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing potential products, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we may challenge the patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties and if we are unsuccessful in actions we bring against the rights of such parties, through litigation or otherwise, and it is\ndetermined that we infringe the intellectual property rights of such parties, we may be prevented from commercializing potential products in the relevant jurisdiction, or may be required to obtain licenses to those rights or develop or obtain alternative technologies, any of which could harm our business.\nIf we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, our future growth and ability to compete would suffer.\nWe are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management. Additionally, we have scientific personnel with significant and unique expertise in monoclonal antibodies, ADCs and related technologies. The loss of the services of any one of the principal members of our managerial or scientific staff may prevent us from achieving our business objectives.\nIn addition, the competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense, and our future success depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled scientific, technical and managerial employees. In order to commercialize ADCETRIS, we have been required to expand our workforce, particularly in the areas of manufacturing, clinical trials management, regulatory affairs, business development, sales and marketing. These activities required the addition of new personnel, including sales and marketing management, and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel. We continue to face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and other research institutions. To the extent we are not able to retain these individuals on favorable terms or attract any additional personnel that may be required, our business may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and in the scope of our operations. This growth places significant demands on our management, operational and financial resources, and our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our growth. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls and must expand, train and manage our growing employee base, and there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage our growth without experiencing operating inefficiencies or control deficiencies. We expect that we may need to increase our management personnel to oversee our expanding operations, and recruiting and retaining qualified individuals is difficult. In addition, the physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and capital resources. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, or are unsuccessful in recruiting qualified management personnel, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nProduct liability and product recalls could harm our business, and we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us against product liability losses.\nThe current and future use of ADCETRIS by us and our corporate collaborators in clinical trials and the sale of ADCETRIS, expose us to product liability claims. These claims have and may in the future be made directly by consumers or healthcare providers or indirectly by pharmaceutical companies, our corporate collaborators or others selling such products. We may experience substantial financial losses in the future due to product liability claims. We have obtained product liability coverage, including coverage for human clinical trials and product sold commercially. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against all losses. If a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured amounts, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired.\nProduct recalls may be issued at our discretion, or at the discretion of government agencies and other entities that have regulatory authority for pharmaceutical sales. Any recall of ADCETRIS could materially adversely affect our business by rendering us unable to sell ADCETRIS for some time and by adversely affecting our reputation.\nRisks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, and we currently have subsidiaries in the U.K., Switzerland and Canada. Consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries. Risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include:\n\u2022\ndiverse regulatory, financial and legal requirements, and any future changes to such requirements, in one or more countries where we are located or do business;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences, including changes in applicable tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022\napplicable trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions and any changes to them;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political or economic instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses or reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country;\n\u2022\nliabilities for activities of, or related to, our international operations;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; and\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information.\nFor example, since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the U.K. is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially change the regulatory regime applicable to our operations and those of our collaborators, including with respect to marketing authorizations for ADCETRIS and our product candidates. We may also face new regulatory costs and challenges as result of Brexit that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Depending on the terms of Brexit, the U.K. could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members, which may result in increased trade barriers which could make our doing business in Europe more difficult. In addition, currency exchange rates for the British Pound and the Euro with respect to each other and the U.S. dollar have already been affected by Brexit. Should this foreign exchange volatility continue, it could cause volatility in our quarterly financial results. In any event, we cannot predict to what extent these changes will impact our business or results of operations, or our ability to conduct operations in Europe.\nThese and other risks described elsewhere in these risk factors associated with expanding our international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur operations involve hazardous materials and are subject to environmental, health and safety controls and regulations.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use of hazardous materials, and we spend considerable time complying with such laws and regulations. Our business activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and although we take precautions to prevent accidental contamination or injury from these materials, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of using these materials. In the event of an accident or environmental discharge, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, which may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any of our facilities are damaged or our clinical, research and development or other business processes are interrupted, our business could be seriously harmed.\nWe conduct most of our business in a limited number of facilities in a single geographical location in Bothell, Washington. Damage or extended periods of interruption to our corporate, development or research\nfacilities due to fire, natural disaster, power loss, communications failure, unauthorized entry or other events could cause us to cease or delay development of some or all of our product candidates or interrupt the sales process for ADCETRIS. Although we maintain property damage and business interruption insurance coverage on these facilities, our insurance might not cover all losses under such circumstances and our business may be seriously harmed by such delays and interruption.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or breaches of data security, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on information technology systems to keep financial records, capture laboratory data, maintain clinical trial data and corporate records, communicate with staff and external parties and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to disruption due to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses or other disruptive events including but not limited to natural disaster. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in our information technology systems or those of certain of our vendors, it could delay or negatively impact the development and commercialization of ADCETRIS and our product candidates, which could adversely impact our business. Although we maintain offsite back-ups of our data, if operations at our facilities were disrupted, it may cause a material disruption in our business if we are not capable of restoring function on an acceptable timeframe. In addition, our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches-whether by employees or others-which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, customers and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, a security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of, personally identifiable information, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. In addition, a data security breach could result in loss of clinical trial data or damage to the integrity of that data. If we are unable to prevent such security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other negative consequences because of lost or misappropriated information. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above.\nIncreasing use of social media could give rise to liability.\nWe are increasingly relying on social media tools as a means of communications. To the extent that we continue to use these tools as a means to communicate about ADCETRIS and our product candidates or about the diseases that ADCETRIS and our product candidates are intended to treat, there are significant uncertainties as to either the rules that apply to such communications, or as to the interpretations that health authorities will apply to the rules that exist. As a result, despite our efforts to comply with applicable rules, there is a significant risk that our use of social media for such purposes may cause us to nonetheless be found in violation of them. Such uses of social media could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative actions and new accounting pronouncements are likely to impact our future financial position or results of operations.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse, unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our financial position or results of operations. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency in the past and are expected to occur again in the future and as a result we may be required to make changes in our accounting policies. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues and expenses, future profitability or financial position. Compliance with new regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nFor example, in May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an Accounting Standards Update entitled \u201cASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d which will replace the existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018. Our preliminary assessment of this new standard is that it will generally not change the way in which we recognize product revenue from sales of ADCETRIS. However, we expect that sales-based royalties will be recorded in the period of the related sale based on estimates, rather than recording them as reported by the customer. In addition, the achievement of development milestones under our collaborations will be recorded in the period their achievement becomes probable, which may result in their recognition earlier than under current accounting principles. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the new standard on all of our revenues, including those mentioned above, and our assessments may change in the future based on our continuing evaluation. In any event, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenues and costs, could have a significant impact on our reported results. In addition, compliance with new regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses. As a result, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from science and business activities to compliance activities.\nRisks Related to the Immunomedics License\nFailure to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nWe announced on February 10, 2017 that we had entered into the Immunomedics License pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Immunomedics License, we would receive exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize IMMU-132. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License, which has not yet occurred, is subject to customary closing conditions, including expiration of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, there being no pending court or administrative challenges to the Immunomedics License and there being no court or administrative orders blocking the closing. On February 20, 2017, Immunomedics and we entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which Immunomedics irrevocably waived to the extent applicable to Immunomedics the condition precedent to the closing and effectiveness of the Immunomedics License that there be no pending court or administrative challenges to the transaction. Additionally, under the terms of the Immunomedics License, Immunomedics had the right to continue discussions with a small number of parties that previously expressed interest in licensing IMMU-132 until 11:59 p.m. New York City time on February 19, 2017. If a third party had provided Immunomedics with a financially superior licensing offer, we would have had the right to match any such offer, and if we had decided not to match, Immunomedics would have had the right to accept the superior offer and terminate the Immunomedics License upon payment of a termination fee to us. We have not received notice from Immunomedics of any such third party offers during this limited time period, and on February 21, 2017, Immunomedics announced that it is subject to customary \u201cno-shop\u201d restrictions on its and its representatives\u2019 ability to solicit, discuss or negotiate alternative licensing agreement proposals from third parties with regard to IMMU-132. On February 13, 2017, we were named a co-defendant in a lawsuit filed by venBio in the Delaware Chancery Court against the members of the board of directors of Immunomedics, pursuant to which, among other things, venBio seeks to enjoin the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. venBio has also initiated a proxy contest with respect the Immunomedics annual meeting to be held on March 3, 2017, seeking to have its nominees elected to the Immunomedics board of directors in lieu of Immunomedics\u2019 management nominees. As a result of the pending litigation challenging the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License, Immunomedics and we have committed to the Court not to close the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License prior to March 10, 2017. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of the venBio lawsuit or the impact it may have on the Immunomedics License or the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. Likewise, we cannot predict the effect a potential change in the board of directors of Immunomedics could have on our ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. However, it is possible that, in connection with the venBio lawsuit and/or the proxy contest, the Immunomedics License could be rescinded or reformed in a way\nthat is disadvantageous to us, including by requiring us to increase the transaction consideration payable to Immunomedics under the Immunomedics License, or that otherwise adversely affects the anticipated benefits to us of the Immunomedics License. If the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License are not consummated, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having consummated the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe current price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License will occur, such that a failure to complete such transactions could result in a decline in our stock price;\n\u2022\nwe have made an equity investment of approximately $14.7 million in Immunomedics (which investment may never result in a financial return to us) in contemplation of securing exclusive development and commercialization rights to IMMU-132 without realizing any of the benefits of securing such rights;\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the Immunomedics License have required and will continue to require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and other employees, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to reimburse Immunomedics for certain expenses incurred by Immunomedics in connection with the Immunomedics License if it is not consummated; and\n\u2022\nwe may incur significant costs and potential additional harms in connection with the lawsuit brought by venBio.\nWe also could be subject to additional litigation related to any failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License or to perform our obligations under the Immunomedics License. If the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License are not consummated, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nObtaining required approvals necessary to satisfy the conditions to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License and the effect of the venBio lawsuit and the outcome of the Immunomedics proxy contest may delay or prevent completion of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License, result in additional expenditures of money and resources and/or reduce or eliminate the anticipated benefits to us of the Immunomedics License.\nThe closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License is subject to customary closing conditions. These closing conditions include, among others, the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, compliance with antitrust-related filing requirements in certain other countries, there being no pending court or administrative challenges to the Immunomedics License and there being no court or administrative orders blocking the closing. On February 20, 2017, Immunomedics and we entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which Immunomedics irrevocably waived to the extent applicable to Immunomedics the condition precedent to the closing and effectiveness of the Immunomedics License that there be no pending court or administrative challenges to the transaction. Additionally, under the terms of the Immunomedics License, Immunomedics had the right to continue discussions with a small number of parties that previously expressed interest in licensing IMMU-132 until 11:59 p.m. New York City time on February 19, 2017. If a third party had provided Immunomedics with a financially superior licensing offer, we would have had the right to match any such offer, and if we had decided not to match, Immunomedics would have had the right to accept the superior offer and terminate the Immunomedics License upon payment of a termination fee to us. We have not received notice from Immunomedics of any such third party offers during this limited time period, and on February 21, 2017, Immunomedics announced that it is subject to customary \u201cno-shop\u201d restrictions on its and its representatives\u2019 ability to solicit, discuss or negotiate alternative licensing agreement proposals from third parties with regard to IMMU-132. The governmental agencies from which the parties will seek approvals have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. As a condition to their approval, agencies may impose\nrequirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our IMMU-132 activities after the closing. These requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License or may reduce the anticipated benefits to us of the Immunomedics License. If we and Immunomedics agree to any material requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions in order to obtain any approvals required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License, these requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions could adversely affect the anticipated benefits of the Immunomedics License. In addition, it is possible that, in connection with the venBio lawsuit and/or the proxy contest, the Immunomedics License could be rescinded or reformed in a way that is disadvantageous to us, including by requiring us to increase the transaction consideration payable to Immunomedics under the Immunomedics License, or that otherwise adversely affects the anticipated benefits to us of the Immunomedics License. Any of these factors could result in a failure to consummate these transactions or have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate IMMU-132 or any other potential future product candidates we may acquire or license rights to, or we may otherwise fail to realize their full potential.\nWe actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or otherwise acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses, and we recently announced our entry into the Immunomedics License with Immunomedics pursuant to which, if consummated, we would be granted an exclusive worldwide license to IMMU-132. However, we cannot ensure that we would be able to manage the risks associated with the transfer of development, regulatory and manufacturing activities for IMMU-132 from Immunomedics to us or manage the risks associated with integrating IMMU-132 into our existing business and infrastructure. We may encounter unexpected difficulties during the transfer, integration or further development of IMMU-132, any of which may cause us to expend greater funds and efforts or may slow, delay or limit the progress of IMMU-132\u2019s development. Unexpected difficulties may further be disruptive to our ongoing development and commercialization efforts, put a strain on our existing personnel, infrastructure and business and divert management\u2019s time and attention. As a result of these or other problems and risks, even if the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License are consummated, we may never receive regulatory approval for IMMU-132, we may not realize the full potential of IMMU-132 or we may never generate significant value or revenues from IMMU-132.\nIn addition, the market price of our common stock may decline if the integration or further development of IMMU-132 is unsuccessful, takes longer than expected or fails to result in benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors, or the effect of our license of IMMU-132 on our financial position and results of operations is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile and our shares may suffer a decline in value.\nThe market price of our stock has in the past been, and is likely to continue in the future to be, very volatile. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our closing stock price fluctuated between $26.87 and $73.71 per share. As a result of fluctuations in the price of our common stock, you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them. The market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of ADCETRIS sales in the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan and other countries in which Takeda has received approval by relevant regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding the results of discovery efforts and preclinical, clinical and commercial activities by us, or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of FDA or foreign regulatory approval or non-approval of ADCETRIS, or specific label indications for or restrictions, warnings or limitations in its use, or delays in the regulatory review or approval process, including in connection with our planned sBLA submission to the FDA to seek approval of ADCETRIS in the ALCANZA treatment setting;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding the results of the clinical trials we and/or Takeda are conducting or may in the future conduct for ADCETRIS, including our ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 phase 3 trials;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding, or negative publicity concerning, adverse events associated with the use of ADCETRIS or our product candidates, including announcements similar to our December 2016 announcement that the FDA had placed a clinical hold or a partial clinical hold on several early stage trials of SGN-CD33A in AML to evaluate the potential risk of hepatotoxicity following adverse medical events, including fatal events;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or changed analysts\u2019 reports and recommendations regarding us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ntermination of or changes in our existing collaborations or licensing arrangements, especially our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda or establishment of new collaborations or licensing arrangements;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding the Immunomedics License, or the termination of or other changes to the Immunomedics License and the related lawsuit brought by venBio;\n\u2022\nour entry into additional material strategic transactions including licensing or acquisition of products, businesses or technologies;\n\u2022\nactions taken by regulatory authorities with respect to our product candidates, our clinical trials or our regulatory filings, including the imposition or lifting of clinical trial holds on trials of SGN-CD33A and our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour raising of additional capital and the terms upon which we may raise any additional capital;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions for equity investments in general, or the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries in particular;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ndevelopments regarding the pending and potential additional related purported securities class action lawsuits, as well as any other potential litigation;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations; and\n\u2022\neconomic or other external factors.\nThe stock markets in general, and the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks in particular, have historically experienced significant volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. For example, negative publicity regarding drug pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. Likewise, as a result of Brexit and/or significant changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade and health care spending and delivery, including the potential repeal and/or replacement of all or portions of PPACA or greater restrictions on free trade stemming from Trump Administration policies, the financial markets could experience significant volatility that could also negatively impact the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, class action or derivative litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. In this regard, we have become, and may in the future again become, subject to claims and litigation alleging violations of the securities laws or other related claims, which could harm our business and require us to incur significant costs. The pending purported securities class action lawsuit and any additional lawsuits brought against us could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and results of operations and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could result in delays of our clinical trials or our development and commercialization efforts.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock or equity-related securities could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the public market, including sales by members of our management or board of directors or entities affiliated with such members, could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-related securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. As of February 16, 2017, we had 142,493,676 shares of common stock outstanding, all of which shares are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in some cases to the volume limitations and manner of sale and other requirements under Rule 144. In addition, we may issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock or equity- related securities, including convertible debt, to meet our capital needs, including in connection with funding acquisition or licensing opportunities, capital expenditures or product development costs, which issuances could be substantially dilutive and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Likewise, future issuances by us of our common stock upon the exercise, conversion or settlement of equity-based awards or other equity-related securities would dilute existing stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in our company and any sales in the public market of these shares, or the perception that these sales might occur, could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nMoreover, we have in the past and may in the future grant rights to some of our stockholders that require us to register the resale of our common stock or other securities on behalf of these stockholders and/or facilitate public offerings of our securities held by these stockholders, including in connection with potential future acquisition or capital-raising transactions. For example, in connection with our September 2015 public offering of common stock, we entered into a registration rights agreement with entities affiliated with Baker Bros. Advisors LP, or the Baker Entities, that together, based on information available to us, collectively beneficially owned approximately 32.1% of our common stock as of February 16, 2017. Under the registration rights agreement, if at any time and from time to time the Baker Entities demand that we register their shares of our common stock for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, we would be obligated to effect such registration. On October 12, 2016, pursuant to the registration rights agreement, we registered for resale, from time to time, up to 44,059,594 shares of our common stock held by the Baker Entities. Our registration obligations under the registration rights agreement cover all shares now held or hereafter acquired by the Baker Entities, will continue in effect for up to ten years, and include our obligation to facilitate certain underwritten public offerings of our common stock by the Baker Entities in the future. If the Baker Entities, by its exercise of these registration and/or underwriting rights in the future, or otherwise, sell a large number of our shares, or the market perceives that the Baker Entities intend to sell a large number of our shares, including in connection with our October 2016 registration of shares held by the Baker Entities for resale, this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have also filed registration statements to register the sale of our common stock reserved for issuance under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements.\nOur existing stockholders have significant control of our management and affairs.\nOur executive officers and directors and holders of greater than five percent of our outstanding voting stock, together with entities that may be deemed affiliates of, or related to, such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 68.1% of our voting power as of February16, 2017. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, are able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, which might affect the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders, which authority could be used to adopt a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that could act to prevent a change of control of Seattle Genetics that has not been approved by our Board of Directors. The rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of Seattle Genetics without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. Further, certain provisions of our charter documents, including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of Seattle Genetics, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock. In addition, our charter documents provide for a classified board, which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors. Similarly, state anti-takeover laws in Delaware and Washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of Seattle Genetics.", "PERMNO": 88949, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SGEN"}
