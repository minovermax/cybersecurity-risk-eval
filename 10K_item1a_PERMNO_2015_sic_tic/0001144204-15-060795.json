{"cik": "1385508", "company": "Lightlake Therapeutics Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-10-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nLightlake has generated limited revenue to date and expects to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nLightlake was incorporated on June 21, 2005. The Company operates as a specialty pharmaceutical company developing opioid antagonist treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders. The Company has generated limited revenues from inception through the date of this report. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays encountered in connection with the clinical trials that will be conducted and on the development of new solutions to common addictions and related disorders. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the clinical trials, changes in the regulatory and competitive landscape, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current budget estimates for the completion of the trials. Prior to completion of any Phase III clinical trials with respect to treating obesity and eating disorders, the Company anticipates that the Company will incur increased operating expenses. The Company expects to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. The Company recognizes that if the Company is unable to generate funding or sufficient revenues, the Company will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that the Company will prove successful. If the Company is unsuccessful in addressing these risks, then the Company will most likely fail.\nLightlake may not succeed in completing the development of its products, commercializing its products, and generating significant revenues.\nSince commencing operations, Lightlake has focused on the research and development of using naloxone to: (i) reverse opioid overdoses, (ii) treat overweight and obese patients with Binge Eating Disorder; and (iii) treat Cocaine Use Disorder. The Company\u2019s products have generated limited revenues. The Company\u2019s ability to generate significant revenues and achieve profitability depends on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully complete the development of its products, obtain market approval, and generate significant revenues. On December 15, 2014, the Company and Adapt entered into the Adapt Agreement that provides Adapt with a global license to develop and commercialize the Company\u2019s intranasal naloxone opioid overdose reversal treatment. The loss for any reason of Adapt as a key partner could have a significant and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business. If the Company is unable to retain Adapt as a partner on commercially acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to commercialize the Company\u2019s products as planned and the Company may experience delays in or suspension of the Company\u2019s marketing launch of the Company\u2019s products.\nThe future success of Lightlake\u2019s business cannot be determined at this time, and the Company does not anticipate generating revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company expects to generate revenues from the treatment using naloxone to reverse opioid overdoses, for which the Company is dependent on many factors, including the performance of the Company\u2019s licensing partner Adapt. In addition, the Company has no experience in commercializing its treatments on its own and faces a number of challenges with respect to its commercialization efforts, including, among others, that:\n\u2022 the Company may not have adequate financial or other resources to complete the development of its products;\n\u2022 the Company may not be able to manufacture its products in commercial quantities, at an adequate quality, or at an acceptable cost;\n\u2022 the Company may not be able to establish adequate sales, marketing, and distribution channels;\n\u2022 healthcare professionals and patients may not accept the Company\u2019s treatments;\n\u2022 the Company may not be aware of possible complications from the continued use of its products since the Company has limited clinical experience with respect to the actual use of its products;\n\u2022 technological breakthroughs in reversing opioid overdoses, treating overweight and obese patients with Binge Eating Disorder, and treating Cocaine Use Disorder may reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s products;\n\u2022 changes in the market for reversing opioid overdoses, treating overweight and obese patients with Binge Eating Disorder, and treating Cocaine Use Disorder, new alliances between existing market participants, and the entrance of new market participants may interfere with the Company\u2019s market penetration efforts;\n\u2022 third-party payors may not agree to reimburse patients for any or all of the purchase price of the Company\u2019s products, which may adversely affect patients\u2019 willingness to purchase the Company\u2019s products;\n\u2022 uncertainty as to market demand may result in inefficient pricing of the Company\u2019s products;\n\u2022 the Company may face third-party claims of intellectual property infringement;\n\u2022 the Company may fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for its products in the Company\u2019s target markets or may face adverse regulatory or legal actions relating to its products even if regulatory approval is obtained; and\n\u2022 the Company is dependent upon the results of clinical studies relating to its products and the products of its competitors.\nIf Lightlake is unable to meet any one or more of these challenges successfully, the Company\u2019s ability to effectively commercialize its products could be limited, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGiven Lightlake\u2019s limited revenue and cash flow, the Company may need to raise additional capital, which may be unavailable to the Company or, even if consummated, may cause dilution or place significant restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to operate.\nSince Lightlake may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or cash flow to fund its operations for the foreseeable future, the Company may need to seek additional equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to maintain or expand its operations. The Company may also need additional funding to continue the development of its products, increase its sales and marketing capabilities, promote brand identity, or develop or acquire complementary companies, technologies and assets, as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes.\nLightlake does not currently have any arrangements or credit facilities in place as a source of funds, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient additional capital if needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, the Company may be required to delay, scale back, or eliminate the development of business opportunities and its ability to achieve its business objectives, its competitiveness, and its operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. The Company\u2019s inability to fund its business could thus lead to the loss of your investment.\nIf Lightlake raises additional capital by issuing equity securities and/or equity-linked securities, the percentage ownership of the Company\u2019s existing stockholders may be reduced, and accordingly these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. The Company may also issue equity securities and/or equity-linked securities that provide for rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of its Common Stock. Given the Company\u2019s need for cash and that equity and equity-linked issuances are very common types of fundraising for companies like the Company, the risk of dilution is particularly significant for stockholders of the Company.\nDebt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on Lightlake\u2019s assets and covenants limiting or restricting the Company\u2019s ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt. Debt financing could also be required to be repaid regardless of the Company\u2019s operating results.\nIf Lightlake raises additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, the Company may be required to relinquish some rights to its products, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to the Company.\nLightlake has no experience as a company in obtaining regulatory approval for, or commercializing, any product candidate.\nAs a company, Lightlake has never obtained regulatory approval for, or commercialized, any product candidate. It is possible that the FDA may conclude after review of the Company\u2019s data from clinical studies that the data is insufficient to obtain regulatory approval. The FDA may also conclude that the Company has not met the requirements to obtain regulatory approval for its treatments. If the FDA does not accept or approve the Company\u2019s treatments, it may require that the Company conduct additional clinical, preclinical, or manufacturing validation studies, which may be costly, and submit that data before it will reconsider the Company\u2019s application. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA required studies, approval of any NDA or other application that the Company submits may be significantly delayed, possibly for several years, or may require the Company to expend more resources than it has available. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, regulatory approvals would prevent the Company from commercializing its products, generating significant revenues in the case of the Company\u2019s treatment using naloxone to reverse opioid overdoses, or generating any revenues at all in the case of the Company\u2019s other treatments, and achieving and sustaining profitability. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA to approve any NDA the Company submits. The Company faces similar risks for any approval in a foreign jurisdiction.\nLightlake\u2019s current and future operations substantially depend on the Company\u2019s management team and the Company\u2019s ability to hire other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt the Company\u2019s business operations.\nLightlake\u2019s business depends and will continue to depend in substantial part on the continued service of Dr. Roger Crystal and Kevin Pollack. The loss of the services of either of these individuals would significantly impede implementation and execution of the Company\u2019s business strategy and may result in the failure to reach its goals. The Company does not carry key person life insurance on any of its management, which would leave the Company uncompensated for the loss of any of its management.\nIn addition, although Dr. Crystal devotes 35 hours per week to his work for Lightlake, he has a job as part of the management team, albeit not as an executive officer, of a private company to which he also devotes 35 hours per week. Dr. Crystal will abide by the doctrine of corporate opportunity, and will only take for himself a business opportunity if: (1) the opportunity is offered to Dr. Crystal in his individual capacity and not in his capacity as an officer and director of the Company; (2) the opportunity is not essential to the Company; (3) the Company has no interest or expectancy with regard to the opportunity; and (4) Dr. Crystal has not employed the resources of the Company in pursuing or exploiting the opportunity.\nLightlake\u2019s future viability and ability to achieve sales and profits will also depend on the Company\u2019s ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required for continuing its operations. There is a risk that the Company will be unable to attract, train, retain, or motivate qualified personnel, both near term or in the future, and the Company\u2019s failure to do so may severely damage its prospects.\nLightlake\u2019s independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for the Company which includes a statement describing the Company\u2019s going concern status. The Company\u2019s financial status creates a doubt whether the Company will continue as a going concern.\nBased on Lightlake\u2019s financial history since inception, the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has generated limited revenue to date.\nLightlake\u2019s products may have undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require it to be taken off the market, require it to include safety warnings or otherwise limit sales of the product.\nUnforeseen side effects from Lightlake\u2019s products could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the Company\u2019s products has been marketed. This could cause regulatory approvals for, or market acceptance of, the Company\u2019s products harder and more costly to obtain.\nTo date, no serious adverse events have been attributed to Lightlake\u2019s products. The results of the Company\u2019s planned or any future clinical trials may show that the Company\u2019s products causes undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and result in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or result in marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities with restrictive label warnings.\nIf Lightlake\u2019s products receive marketing approval and the Company or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by the use of the Company\u2019s products:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the products, which would force the Company to remove its products from the market;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication, or field alerts to physicians, pharmacies, and others;\n\u2022 the Company may be required to change instructions regarding the way the products are administered, conduct additional clinical trials, or change the labeling of the products;\n\u2022 the Company may be subject to limitations on how it may promote the products;\n\u2022 sales of the products may decrease significantly;\n\u2022 the Company may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022 the Company\u2019s reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent Lightlake or its potential future collaborators from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the Company\u2019s products or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent the Company from generating significant revenues from the sale of its products.\nLightlake currently has no marketing and sales organization and has no experience as a company in marketing pharmaceutical products. If the Company is unable to establish its own marketing and sales capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties, to market and sell its products after they are approved, the Company may not be able to generate product revenues.\nLightlake does not have a sales organization for the marketing, sales, and distribution of any pharmaceutical products. In order to commercialize the Company\u2019s products or any other product candidate the Company may develop or acquire in the future, the Company must develop these capabilities on its own or make arrangements with third parties for the marketing, sales, and distribution of its products. The establishment and development of the Company\u2019s own sales force would be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and the Company cannot be certain that it would be able to successfully develop this capability. As a result, the Company may seek one or more licensing partners to handle some or all of the sales and marketing of its products in the U.S. and elsewhere. There also may be certain markets within the U.S. for the Company\u2019s products for which the Company may seek a co-promotion arrangement. However, the Company may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell its products on favorable terms or at all. In the event the Company is unable to develop its own marketing and sales force or collaborate with a third-party marketing and sales organization, the Company would not be able to commercialize its products or any other product candidates that it develops, which would negatively impact its ability to generate product revenues. Furthermore, whether the Company commercializes products on its own or relies on a third party to do so, the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue would be dependent on the effectiveness of the sales force. In addition, to the extent the Company relies on third parties to commercialize its approved products, the Company would likely receive less revenues than if the Company commercialized these products itself.\nLightlake relies heavily on the Adapt Agreement and Adapt to develop and commercialize its intranasal naloxone opioid overdose reversal treatment.\nOn December 15, 2014, Lightlake and Adapt entered into the Adapt Agreement that provides Adapt with a global license to develop and commercialize the Company\u2019s intranasal naloxone opioid overdose reversal treatment. The Company may be unable to establish or maintain this relationship on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all. In addition, Adapt may have similar or more established relationships with the Company\u2019s competitors or larger customers. Moreover, the loss for any reason of Adapt as a key partner could have a significant and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business. If the Company is unable to retain Adapt as a partner on commercially acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to commercialize its products as planned and it may experience delays in or suspension of its marketing launch of its products. The same could apply to other product candidates the Company may develop or acquire in the future. The Company\u2019s dependence upon third parties may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate profits or acceptable profit margins and the Company\u2019s ability to develop and deliver such products on a timely and competitive basis.\nLightlake is exposed to product liability, non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon the Company, should lawsuits be filed against the Company.\nLightlake\u2019s business exposes the Company to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. The Company expects that such claims are likely to be asserted against it at some point. In addition, the use in the Company\u2019s clinical trials of pharmaceutical formulations and products and the subsequent sale of these formulations or products by the Company or its potential collaborators may cause the Company to bear a portion of or all product liability risks. The Company currently does not have adequate insurance coverage relating to personal injury, product liability, medical expenses, and office premises. However, any claim under any existing insurance policies or future insurance policies may be subject to certain exceptions, and may not be honored fully, in part, in a timely manner, or at all, and may not cover the full extent of liability the Company may actually face. Therefore, a successful liability claim or series of claims brought against the Company could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Lightlake\u2019s Common Stock\nThe trading in Lightlake\u2019s shares is regulated by Securities and Exchange Commission rule 15g-9 which established the definition of a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nAlthough Lightlake\u2019s shares are currently traded at a price higher than $5.00, the Company\u2019s shares have frequently traded in the past at a price lower than $5.00. If the Company\u2019s share price goes below $5.00, the shares will be defined as a \u201cPenny Stock\u201d under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and rules of the Commission. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system). Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in the Company\u2019s securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of the Company\u2019s securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell the Company\u2019s common stock and may affect your ability to resell Company\u2019s common stock.\nLightlake will incur ongoing costs and expenses for SEC reporting and compliance. Without sufficient revenue the Company may not be able to remain in compliance, making it difficult for investors to sell their shares, if at all.\nLightlake\u2019s shares are quoted on the OTCQB Market under the symbol \u201cLLTP.\u201d To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for the Company to remain in compliance the Company will require cash to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s available cash resources. If the Company is unable to remain in compliance it may be difficult for the Company\u2019s stockholders to resell any shares, if at all.\nLightlake does not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on its Common Stock.\nLightlake currently intends to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of its business. Accordingly, the Company does not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, but will review this policy as circumstances dictate.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under applicable law, Lightlake is subject to lessened disclosure requirements, which could leave its stockholders without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies.\nFor as long as Lightlake remains an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which is referred to herein as the JOBS Act), the Company has elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022 taking advantage of an extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards;\n\u2022 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the Company\u2019s periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u2022 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nLightlake expects to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until it is no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Because of these lessened regulatory requirements, the Company\u2019s stockholders would be left without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies.\nBecause Lightlake has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d its financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nLightlake has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows the Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, the Company\u2019s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates, and thus investors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing the Company\u2019s business, performance or prospects in comparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nLightlake will incur ongoing costs and expenses for SEC reporting and compliance. Without significant revenue the Company may not be able to remain in compliance, making it difficult for investors to sell their shares, if at all.\nLightlake\u2019s shares are quoted on the OTCQB Market under the symbol \u201cLLTP.\u201d To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for the Company to remain in compliance the Company will require cash to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s available cash resources. If the Company is unable to remain in compliance it may be difficult for the Company\u2019s shareholders to resell any shares, if at all.", "PERMNO": 16904, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "OPNT"}
