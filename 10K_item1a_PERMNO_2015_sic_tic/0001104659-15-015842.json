RISK FACTORS\nThe nature of the business activities we conduct subjects us to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities. Other risks are described in \u201cItem 1. Business - Freight Transportation (ABF Freight) Segment - Competition, Pricing, and Industry Factors\u201d and \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of these risks or circumstances actually occurs, it could materially harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations and impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe are subject to business risks affecting the transportation industry in general as well as risks specific to our company that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to business factors affecting the transportation industry. General and industry-specific factors that could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors: cyber incidents; disruptions or failures of services essential to the use of information technology platforms in our business; violation of international, federal, or state regulations and increasing costs for compliance with such regulations; an increasingly competitive industry and freight rate environment; general economic factors and instability in financial and credit markets; difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified employees, drivers, dockworkers, and/or independent owner operators; volatile fuel prices as well as the rates of change in associated fuel surcharges, the effect of fuel surcharge changes on securing increases in base freight rates, and the inability to collect fuel surcharges; the inability to obtain sufficient fuel supplies; shortage of third-party service providers or our inability to obtain reliable services from third-parties at reasonable prices; loss of market share to freight transportation service providers outside the motor carrier sector; increasing capital requirements; increases in the frequency and/or the severity of workers\u2019 compensation, third-party casualty, cargo loss, and/or self-insurance medical claims; increases in workers\u2019 compensation, third-party casualty, and/or cargo loss insurance premiums; violations and costs of complying with environmental laws or regulations; emissions-control regulations; increases in the cost of, or decreases in the availability of, new equipment and decreases in the amount we are able to obtain for sales of our used equipment; increasing costs of maintenance for revenue equipment; weather or seasonal fluctuations, including any influence of climate change; risks associated with conducting international business; and/or antiterrorism measures.\nWe are also subject to company-specific risks that could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations including, but not limited to, the following factors: a failure of our information systems; costs or liabilities associated with legal proceedings; increases in the required contributions under ABF Freight\u2019s collective bargaining agreements with the IBT for wage and/or benefit contributions to multiemployer plans or the assessment of a multiemployer plan withdrawal liability; unfavorable terms of or the inability to reach an agreement on future collective bargaining agreements or a workforce stoppage by our employees covered under ABF Freight\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with the IBT; loss of key employees; default on covenants of financing arrangements and the availability and terms of future financing arrangements; excess or insufficient capacity resulting from timing of capital investments; potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; damage to our brands or corporate reputation; unsuccessful implementation or delayed increases in business volumes of our service and growth initiatives and non-asset-based businesses; and/or unsuccessful business acquisitions.\nIn addition to the aforementioned factors, each of which is discussed in further detail in this Risk Factors section, we may also be negatively impacted by a sustained interruption in our systems or operations, including, but not limited to, infrastructure damage, the loss of a key location such as a distribution center, or a significant disruption to the electric grid, or by a significant decline in demand for our services, each of which may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, or lightning strikes; illegal acts, including terrorist attacks; and/or other market disruptions.\nThe foregoing risks are largely out of our control and any one of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nOur information technology systems are subject to cyber risks, some of which are beyond our control, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nWe depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems, including communications and data processing systems, in operating our business. These systems include proprietary software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. It is important that the data processed by these systems remain confidential, as it often includes competitive customer information, confidential customer transaction data, employee records, and key financial and operational results and statistics. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant impact on our operations. Certain of our software applications or underlying data are utilized by third parties who provide certain outsourced administrative functions, which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident.\nWe have experienced incidents involving attempted denial of service, malware attacks, and other events intended to disrupt information systems, wrongfully obtain valuable information, or cause other types of malicious events that could have resulted in harm to our business. To date, the systems we have employed have been effective in identifying these types of events at a point when the impact on our business could be minimized. We have made and continue to make significant financial investment in technologies and processes to mitigate these risks, and our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as backup systems considered appropriate by management. However, it is not practicable to protect against the possibility of power loss, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity attacks, and other cyber incidents in every potential circumstance that may arise.\nOur business interruption insurance, which would offset losses up to certain coverage limits in the event of a catastrophe, would not specifically extend to losses arising from a cyber incident. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nWe may also be negatively impacted by a sustained interruption in our systems or operations, including, but not limited to, infrastructure damage, the loss of a key location such as a distribution center, or a significant disruption to the electric grid, each of which may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, or lightning strikes; illegal acts, including terrorist attacks; and/or other market disruptions.\nCosts incurred and/or loss of business associated with disruptions or failures of essential services upon which our information technology platforms rely could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business requires the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology, computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure, including our proprietary information technology platforms, which depend upon the Internet, global communications providers, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, electric utility providers, and telecommunications providers. Our communications system is critical to understanding customer demands, accepting and planning loads, dispatching equipment and drivers, and billing and collecting for our services. Our operations and those of our technology and communications and other related service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, lightning strikes, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, Internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. We have no control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of services provided by our vendors or whether they will improve their services or continue to provide services that are essential to our business. Disruptions or failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely, or in other services provided to us by outside service providers upon which we rely to operate our business, may adversely affect the services we provide, which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business operations are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nVarious federal and state agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, generally governing such activities as operations of and authorization to engage in motor carrier freight transportation, operations of non-vessel-operating common carriers, safety, contract compliance, insurance requirements, tariff and trade policies, employment practices, taxation, and financial reporting. We could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, such\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nas regulations relating to engine emissions, drivers\u2019 hours of service, occupational safety and health, ergonomics, or cargo security. Compliance with such regulations could substantially reduce equipment productivity, and the costs of compliance could increase our operating expenses.\nThe DOT rules regulating driving time for commercial truck drivers have had a minimal impact upon our operations. Implementation of the new hours-of-service rules has had a slightly negative impact on driver utilization for ABF Freight and Panther. Future changes in these rules could have further adverse effects on our operating efficiency and increase costs.\nOur drivers and dockworkers, including those employed by third-party contract carriers, also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. The TSA has adopted regulations that require all drivers who carry hazardous materials to undergo background checks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation when they obtain or renew their licenses.\nCSA regulations could potentially result in a loss of business to other carriers, driver shortages, increased costs for qualified drivers, and driver and/or business suspension for noncompliance. A resulting decline in the availability of qualified drivers, coupled with additional personnel required to satisfy future revisions to hours-of-service regulations, could adversely impact our ability to hire drivers and contract third-party carriers to adequately meet current or future business needs. Shippers may be influenced by the publicly-available scores in selecting a carrier to haul their freight and, although ABF Freight is recognized in the industry for its commitment to safety, carriers with better CSA scores may be selected in certain cases. In addition, because substantially all of the network capacity for the operations of Panther and ABF Logistics is provided by third-party contract carriers, we are impacted by CSA scores of their contracted owner operators and third-party carriers. Unsatisfactory CSA scores could result in a DOT intervention or audit, resulting in the assessment of fines, penalties, or a downgrade of our safety rating. Our failures, or the failures of our contracted owner operators and third-party carriers, to comply with DOT safety regulations or downgrades in our safety rating could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. A downgrade in our safety rating could cause us to lose the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs or we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage.\nWe are also subject to operating regulations related to environmental matters, such as our operation under non-discharge certifications or storm water permits of the federal Clean Water Act at certain ABF Freight facilities. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. Violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to cleanup costs and liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of our applicable insurance coverage, including substantial fines, civil penalties, or civil and criminal liability, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFor the global operations of our ABF Logistics segment, we are licensed as an ocean freight forwarder by and registered as an ocean transportation intermediary with the Federal Maritime Commission (the \u201cFMC\u201d). The FMC has established qualifications for shipping agents, including surety bonding requirements. The FMC is also responsible for the economic regulation of non-vessel operating common carriers that contract for space and sell that space to commercial shippers and other non-vessel operating common carriers for freight originating or terminating in the United States. If we fail to comply with the regulations of the FMC, we may be subject to penalties or revocation of our permits or licenses, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of global logistics operations.\nMany states have initiated enforcement programs to evaluate the classification of independent contractors, and class actions and other lawsuits have arisen in our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers\u2019 compensation, wage-and-hour, and health care coverage. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations resulting in the reclassification of the owner operators of our Panther segment as employees. In the event of such reclassification of our owner operators, we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. These liabilities and additional costs could include exposure, for both future and prior periods, under federal, state, and local tax laws, and workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of our Panther segment.\nIncreases in license and registration fees, bonding requirements, or taxes, including federal fuel taxes, or the implementation of new forms of operating taxes on the industry could also have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nThe ongoing development of data privacy laws may require changes to our data security policies and procedures, and the associated costs of the changes required to maintain our compliance with standards in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur non-asset-based segments utilize third-party service providers who are subject to similar regulation requirements as previously mentioned. If the operations of these providers are impacted to the extent that a shortage of quality third-party service providers occurs, there could be a material adverse effect on the operating results and business growth of our non-asset-based segments. Also, activities by these providers that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in government or third party actions against us. Although third-party service providers with whom we contract agree to abide by our policies and procedures, we may not be aware of, and therefore unable to remedy, violations by them.\nWe are subject to litigation risks that could result in significant expenditures and have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, competitive matters, personal injury, property damage, cargo claims, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability, and other matters. We are subject to risk and uncertainties related to liabilities which may result from the cost of defending against class-action litigation, such as alleged violations of anti-trust laws, wage-and-hour and discrimination claims, and any other legal proceedings. Some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle, or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost and ability to obtain insurance in the future. Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business reputation and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, and employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in legal proceedings. For more information related to the Company\u2019s legal proceedings, see Note P to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans.\nABF Freight contributes to multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans to provide benefits for its contractual employees. ABF Freight\u2019s contributions generally are based on the time worked by its contractual employees, in accordance with its collective bargaining agreement with the IBT, and other related supplemental agreements.\nThe multiemployer plans to which ABF Freight contributes, which have been established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, are jointly-trusteed (half of the trustees of each plan are selected by the participating employers, the other half by the IBT) and cover collectively-bargained employees of multiple unrelated employers. Due to the inherent nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets received by the plans are not segregated by employer, and contributions made by one employer can be and are used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan completely withdraws from the plan, it owes to the plan its proportionate share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A complete withdrawal generally occurs when the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan. A withdrawal liability is also owed in the event the employer withdraws from a plan in connection with a mass withdrawal, which generally occurs when all or substantially all employers withdraw from the plan pursuant to an agreement in a relatively short period of time. Were ABF Freight to completely withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, whether in connection with a mass withdrawal or otherwise, under current law, it would have material liabilities for its share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan. However, ABF Freight currently has no intention to withdraw from any such plan, which generally would have to be effected through collective bargaining.\nThe 25 multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes vary greatly in size and in funded status. ABF Freight\u2019s contribution obligations to these plans are specified in the ABF NMFA, which was implemented on November 3, 2013 and will remain in effect through March 31, 2018. The funding obligations to the multiemployer pension plans are intended to satisfy the requirements imposed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \u201cPPA\u201d), which was permanently extended by the Reform Act under the CFCAA. Among other things, the PPA requires that \u201cendangered\u201d (generally less than 80% funded and commonly called \u201cyellow zone\u201d) plans adopt \u201cfunding improvement plans\u201d and that \u201ccritical\u201d (generally less than 65% funded and commonly called \u201cred zone\u201d) plans adopt \u201crehabilitation plans\u201d that are intended to improve the plan\u2019s funded status over time. The Reform Act also created a new designation of \u201ccritical and declining\u201d status (applicable to critical status plans that are projected to become insolvent anytime in the current plan year or during the next 14 plan years, or during the next 19 plan years\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nand either the plan\u2019s ratio of inactive participants to active participants exceeds two to one or the plan\u2019s funded percentage is less than 80%), which qualifies a fund for certain self-correcting provisions of the Reform Act, subject to various requirements and restrictions, to address severely underfunded plans (see Note J to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight\u2019s contribution obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. However, we cannot determine with any certainty the contributions that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements for its contractual employees.\nSeveral of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes are underfunded and, in some cases, significantly underfunded. The underfunded status of these plans developed over many years, and we believe that an improved funded status will also take time to be achieved. In addition, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact the viability of contributing employers. The reduction or loss of contributions by member employers, the impact of market risk on plan assets and liabilities, and the effect of any one or combination of the aforementioned business risks, which are outside our control, have the potential to adversely affect the funded status of the multiemployer pension plans, potential withdrawal liabilities, and our future contribution requirements. We believe that the trustees of these funds will take appropriate measures to fulfill their fiduciary duty to preserve the integrity of the plans, or in certain cases, to extend the solvency of the funds by utilizing a combination of several possible initiatives as they have done in the past. Furthermore, certain provisions of the Reform Act or additional legislative changes or action taken by governmental agencies could provide relief. However, we cannot make any assurances regarding these issues, including whether the funds will exercise the options available to them under the Reform Act to improve their severe underfunding situations.\nBased on the most recent annual funding notices we have received, most of which are for plan years ended December 31, 2013, approximately 64% of ABF Freight\u2019s contributions to multiemployer pension plans are made to plans that are in \u201ccritical status,\u201d including the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (the \u201cCentral States Pension Plan\u201d), and approximately 3% of our contributions are made to plans that are in \u201cendangered status,\u201d as defined by the PPA.\nApproximately one-half of ABF Freight\u2019s multiemployer pension contributions were made to the Central States Pension Plan. The funded percentage of the Central States Pension Plan, as set forth in information provided by the Central States Pension Plan, was 48.4%, 47.6%, and 53.9% as of January 1, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In 2005, the IRS granted an extension of the period of time over which the Central States Pension Plan amortizes unfunded liabilities by ten years, subject to the condition that a targeted funding ratio is maintained by the plan. Based on information currently available to us, the Central States Pension Plan has not received notice of revocation of the ten-year amortization extension granted by the IRS. In the unlikely event that the IRS were to revoke the extension, the revocation would apply retroactively to the 2004 plan year, which would result in a material liability for ABF Freight\u2019s share of the resulting funded deficiency, the extent of which is currently unknown to us. We believe that the occurrence of a revocation that would require recognition of liabilities for ABF Freight\u2019s share of a funded deficiency is remote.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete in the transportation industry.\nWe face significant competition in local, regional, national, and, to a lesser extent, international markets. Numerous factors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively in the transportation and logistics industry, retain our existing customers, or attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These competitive factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 ABF Freight competes with many other LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads. Our Panther and ABF Logistics businesses compete with domestic and global logistics service providers which compete in one or more segments of the transportation industry. Some of our competitors have greater capital resources or a lower cost structure than we do or have other competitive advantages.\n\u00b7 Our nonunion competitors generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure for their freight-handling and driving personnel than union carriers, and our nonunion competitors may have greater operating flexibility. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors allow for a lower cost structure than ours and may impact our competitiveness in the LTL industry.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\n\u00b7 Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices. If customers select transportation service providers based on price alone rather than the total value offered, we may be unable to maintain our operating margins or to maintain or grow tonnage levels.\n\u00b7 Customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors.\n\u00b7 Customers may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting \u201ccore carriers\u201d as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected.\n\u00b7 Certain of our competitors may offer a broader portfolio of services or more effectively bundle their service offerings, which could impair our ability to maintain or grow our share of one or more markets in which we compete.\n\u00b7 Competition in the LTL industry from non-asset-based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect customer relationships and prices in our ABF Freight operations. Conversely, our ABF Logistics and Panther businesses may be adversely impacted if customers develop their own logistics operations, thus reducing demand for our services, or if shippers shift business to truckload brokerage companies or asset-based trucking companies that also offer brokerage services in order to secure access to those companies\u2019 trucking capacity, particularly in times of tight industry-wide capacity.\n\u00b7 The trend toward consolidation in the transportation industry could continue to create larger LTL carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size. ABF Freight could experience some competitive difficulties if the remaining LTL carriers, in fact, realize advantages because of their size. Industry consolidations could also result in our competitors providing a more comprehensive set of services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u00b7 Based on economic conditions and industry trends, customers may transition traditional LTL business to truckload shipments. As the economy improves, shipment sizes can increase, prompting shippers to utilize truckload carriers rather than LTL carriers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our results of operations could be negatively impacted if our long-haul LTL business is reduced by the trend toward truckload consolidation, whereby a customer gathers groups of shipments, which were traditionally transported by long-haul LTL, into full loads which are tendered to a truckload carrier that will transport them to a distant distribution point where they are then transferred to various carriers as short-haul LTL shipments to the ultimate consignees.\nOur business is cyclical in nature, and we are subject to general economic factors and instability in financial and credit markets that are largely beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions. Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers\u2019 business cycles, and changes in their business practices. Our business is directly affected by levels of industrial production and manufacturing, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, primarily in the North American economy, and capacity in the trucking industry. Recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. Economic conditions could adversely affect our customers\u2019 business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, thus negatively impacting our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements. Because a portion of our costs are fixed, it may be difficult for us to quickly adjust our structure proportionately with fluctuations in volume levels. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. For our non-asset-based logistics businesses, our obligation to pay third-party service providers is not contingent upon payment from our customers, to certain of whom we extend credit which increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables.\nWe depend on suppliers for equipment, parts, and services that are critical to our operations. A disruption in the availability or a significant increase in the cost to obtain these supplies, resulting from the effect of adverse economic conditions or related financial constraints on our suppliers\u2019 business levels or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets that from time to time has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets in recent years. We have historically been subject to market risk due to variable interest rates on all or a part of our borrowings under bank credit lines and the secured term loan (\u201cTerm Loan\u201d) under our prior credit agreement, and continue to be subject to such risk on our accounts receivable securitization program and the revolving\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\ncredit facility outstanding under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which we entered into on January 2, 2015. Although we have an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk by effectively converting $50.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, of which $70 million remains outstanding at the end of February 2015, from variable-rate interest to fixed rate interest, changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs related to our revolving credit facility, future borrowings against our accounts receivable securitization program, new capital lease or note payable arrangements, or additional sources of financing. Furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing. If any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by economic conditions or disruption to the capital and credit markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow additional funds, and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. (See Note H to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our financing arrangements.)\nOur qualified nonunion defined benefit pension plan trust holds investments in equity and debt securities. Declines in the value of plan assets resulting from instability in the financial markets, general economic downturn, or other economic factors beyond our control could further diminish the funded status of the nonunion defined benefit pension plan and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plan. A change in the interest rates used to calculate our funding requirements under the PPA may impact contributions required to fund our plan. Significant plan contribution requirements could reduce the cash available for working capital and other business needs and opportunities. An increase in required pension plan contributions may adversely impact our financial condition and liquidity. Substantial future investment losses on pension plan assets would increase pension expense in the years following the losses. In addition, a change in the discount rate used to calculate our obligations for our nonunion defined benefit pension plan and postretirement health benefit plan for financial statement purposes would impact the accumulated benefit obligation and expense for these plans. An increase in expense for these pension and postretirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations. We could also experience losses on investments related to our cash surrender value of variable life insurance policies, which may negatively impact our results of operations.\nEconomic volatility could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position. Furthermore, it is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, or political and/or civil unrest on the economy or on consumer confidence in the United States or the impact, if any, on our future results of operations or financial condition.\nWe depend on our employees to support our business operations and future growth opportunities. If our relationship with our employees deteriorates; if we have difficulty attracting and retaining employees, and/or independent owner operators for Panther\u2019s operations; or if ABF Freight is unable to reach agreement on future collective bargaining agreements, we could be faced with labor inefficiencies, disruptions, or stoppages, or delayed growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reduce our operating results, and place us at a further disadvantage relative to nonunion competitors.\nAs of December 2014, approximately 79% of ABF Freight\u2019s employees were covered under the ABF NMFA, the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT which extends through March 31, 2018. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements or the inability to agree on acceptable terms for the next contract period may result in a work stoppage, the loss of customers, or other events that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. We could also experience a loss of customers or a reduction in our potential share of business in the markets we serve if shippers limit their use of unionized freight transportation service providers because of the risk of work stoppages.\nABF Freight operates in a highly competitive industry which consists predominantly of nonunion motor carriers. ABF Freight\u2019s nonunion competitors have a lower fringe benefit cost structure and less stringent labor work rules, and certain carriers also have lower wage rates for their freight-handling and driving personnel. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors also allow for a lower cost structure than that of ABF Freight. Under its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry. We have not historically experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers and freight-handling personnel for ABF Freight, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage levels. Difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and freight-handling personnel or increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs could affect our profitability and our ability to grow. Government regulations or the\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nadverse impact of certain legislative actions which result in shortages of qualified drivers could also impact our ability to grow the company. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business. In addition to difficulties we may experience in driver retention, if we are unable to effectively manage our relationship with the IBT, we could be less effective in ongoing relations and future negotiations, which could lead to operational inefficiencies and increased operating costs.\nThe driver fleet of our Panther segment is made up of independent owner operators and individuals. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified owner operators from the available pool of drivers and fleets, and we may be required to increase owner operator compensation or take other measures to remain an attractive option for owner operators, which may negatively impact our results of operations. If we are not able to maintain our delivery schedules due to a shortage of drivers or if we are required to increase our rates to offset increases in labor costs, our services may be less competitive which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to maintain and grow our business will also depend, in part, on our ability to retain and attract additional sales representatives and other key operational personnel and properly incentivize them to obtain new customers, maintain existing customer relationships, and efficiently manage our business. If we are unable to maintain or expand our sales and operational workforce, our ability to increase our revenues and operate our business could be negatively impacted.\nOur management team is an important part of our business and loss of key employees could impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and other key employees and depend on their continued services to successfully implement our business strategy. The unexpected loss of key employees could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business. If we are unable to continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and execute succession planning strategies, our business could be negatively impacted in the future.\nWe depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. Fuel shortages, increases in fuel costs, and the inability to collect fuel surcharges or obtain sufficient fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. We have not experienced a lack of available fuel but could be adversely impacted if a fuel shortage develops. A disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters, armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, actions by producers, or other factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at our distribution centers and certain other terminals; however, we may experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules.\nOur ABF Freight and Panther segments charge a fuel surcharge based on changes in diesel fuel prices compared to a national index. Although revenues from fuel surcharges generally more than offset increases in direct diesel fuel costs, other operating costs have been, and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. The total impact of higher energy prices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. We cannot predict, with reasonable certainty, future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of higher energy prices on other cost elements, recoverability of higher fuel costs through fuel surcharges, the effect of fuel surcharges on our overall rate structure, or the total price that we will receive from our customers.\nFuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. During periods of changing diesel fuel prices, the fuel surcharge and associated direct diesel fuel costs also vary by different degrees. Depending upon the rates of these changes and the impact on costs in other fuel- and energy-related areas, operating results could be impacted. Whether fuel prices fluctuate or remain constant, operating results may be adversely affected if competitive pressures limit our ability to recover fuel surcharges. Throughout 2014, the fuel surcharge mechanism generally continued to have market acceptance among our customers, although certain nonstandard arrangements have limited the amount of fuel surcharge recovered. During periods of increasing fuel costs, the negative impact on operating margins of capped fuel surcharge revenue is more evident as fuel prices remain above maximum levels recovered through the fuel surcharge mechanism on certain accounts. In periods of declining fuel prices, which we have experienced since third quarter 2014, our fuel surcharge percentages also decrease, which negatively impacts our revenues, and the revenue decline may be disproportionate to our fuel costs. While the fuel surcharge is one of\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nseveral components in our overall rate structure, the actual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces based on value provided to the customer. When fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. Prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase.\nHigher fuel prices cause customers of our FleetNet segment to seek cost savings throughout their businesses which may result in a reduction of miles driven and/or a deferral of maintenance practices that may reduce the volume of our maintenance service events, resulting in an adverse impact on the segment\u2019s operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nFuel represents a significant operating expense for us, and we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. Significant changes in diesel fuel prices and the associated fuel surcharge may increase volatility in our fuel surcharge revenue and fuel-related costs. Significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from economic or regulatory changes, supply and demand imbalances, actions by producers, or other factors that are out of our control which are not offset by base freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program contain customary financial and other customary restrictive covenants that may limit our future operations. A default under these financing arrangements or changes in regulations which impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which governs our revolving credit facility, contains conditions, representations and warranties, events of default, and indemnification provisions that are customary for financings of this type including, but not limited to, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum adjusted leverage ratio, and limitations on incurrence of debt, investments, liens on assets, certain sale and leaseback transactions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, and sales of assets. Our accounts receivable securitization program contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that are customary for financings of this type, including a maximum adjusted leverage ratio and maintaining certain characteristics of the receivables, such as rates of delinquency, default, and dilution.\nIf we default under the terms of our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or our accounts receivable securitization program and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings under such facilities could be immediately declared due and payable. In the event of a default under either of these facilities, we could automatically default on the other of these facilities and on our outstanding notes payable and other financing agreements, unless the lenders to these facilities choose not to exercise remedies or to otherwise allow us to cure the default. If we fail to pay the amount due under our revolving credit facility or accounts payable securitization program, the lenders could proceed against the collateral by which our revolving credit facility is secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or the facilities could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if the facilities are terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be acceptable. A default under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or accounts receivable securitization program or changes in regulations which impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn addition, failing to achieve certain financial ratios as required by our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions or investments, or plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nWe depend on services provided by third parties, and increased costs or disruption of these services, and claims arising from these services, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and customer relationships.\nA reduction in the availability of rail services or services provided by third party capacity providers to meet customer requirements, as well as higher utilization of third-party agents to maintain service levels in periods of tonnage growth, could increase purchased transportation costs of ABF Freight and ABF Logistics which we may be unable to pass along to our customers. If a disruption or reduction in transportation services from our rail or other third-party service providers occurred, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. In addition, we may not be able to negotiate competitive contracts with railroads to expand our capacity, add additional routes, obtain multiple providers, or obtain railroad services at costs which are acceptable to us or our customers, any of which could limit our ability\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nto provide this service. If these situations occur, our results of operations, cash flows, and customer relationships could be adversely impacted.\nThe inability to obtain the services of reliable third parties at competitive prices; the shortage of quality third-party providers, including owner operators for Panther and drivers of contracted truckload carriers for the brokerage operations of ABF Logistics; shortages in available cargo capacity; equipment shortages, particularly among contracted truckload carriers; or a significant interruption in service or stoppage in third-party transportation services could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our non-asset-based businesses.\nThird-party providers can be expected to increase their prices based on market conditions or to cover increases in operating expenses. These providers are subject to industry regulations which may have a significant impact on their operations, causing them to increase prices or exit the industry. Increased industry demand for these transportation services may reduce available capacity and such a reduction or other changes in these services offered by third parties may increase pricing or otherwise change the services we are able to offer to our customers. If we are unable to correspondingly increase the prices we charge to our customers, or if we are unable to secure sufficient third-party services to meet our commitments to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on the operations, revenues, and profitability of our non-asset-based businesses and our customer relationships.\nOur ability to secure the services of such third-party service providers is affected by many risks beyond our control, including equipment shortages in the transportation industry, labor disputes, and changes in regulations impacting transportation.\nIn addition, we may be subject to claims arising from services provided by third parties, particularly in connection with our Panther and ABF Logistics operations, which are dependent on third-party contract carriers. From time to time, the drivers who are employees, owner operators, or independent contractors working for third-party carriers that we contract with are involved in accidents that may result in cargo loss or damage or serious personal injuries. As a result, claims may be asserted against us for actions by such drivers or for our actions in retaining them. Our third-party contract carriers may not agree to bear responsibility for such claims, and such claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all.\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely impacted by increased competition from freight transportation service providers outside the motor carrier freight transportation industry.\nIn addition to LTL and truckload motor carriers, we compete against other freight transportation service providers, including railroads, which have recently experienced growth due to general economic improvement and a conversion of truckload to intermodal shipping. Certain challenges specific to the motor carrier freight transportation industry, such as the competitive freight rate environment; capacity restraints in times of growing freight volumes; increased costs and potential shortages of commercial truck drivers; changes to driver hours-of-service requirements; increased costs of fuel and other operating expenses; and costs of compliance with existing and potential legal and environmental regulations could result in the service offerings of other freight transportation service providers being more competitive. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely impacted if railroads or other freight transportation sectors increase their share of the market for our services.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms or properly forecast capital needs to correspond with business volumes.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash from operations in the future, our growth could be limited; it may be necessary for us to utilize our existing financing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional leasing or financing arrangements, possibly on less favorable terms; or our revenue equipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increased expenditures for maintenance. Forecasting business volumes involves many factors, including general economic trends and the impact of competition, which are subject to uncertainty and beyond our control. If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, especially for revenue equipment, in relation to corresponding business levels, we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity. In addition, our revolving credit facility contains provisions that could limit our level of annual capital expenditures. If we were unable to properly forecast capital needs and/or were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, obtain adequate financing at acceptable terms, or if our capital spending was otherwise limited, there could be an adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nOngoing claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nClaims may be asserted against us for accidents or for cargo loss or damage occurring in ABF Freight\u2019s operations. Claims may also be asserted against us for accidents involving the operations of third-party service providers that we utilize for our non-asset-based segments, for our actions in retaining their services, or for loss or damage to our customers\u2019 goods for which we are determined to be responsible. Such claims against us may not be covered by insurance policies or may exceed the amount of insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our current self-insurance retention levels for ABF Freight are $1.0 million for each workers\u2019 compensation loss, generally $1.0 million for each third-party casualty loss, and $1.0 million for each cargo loss. Certain of our motor carrier subsidiaries other than ABF Freight are insured but have lower deductibles on their policies. Our self-insurance retention levels for medical benefits are $275,000 per person, per claim year. We maintain insurance for liabilities above the amounts of self-insurance to certain limits. If the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. Significant increases in health care costs related to medical inflation, claims experience, current and future federal and state laws and regulations, and other cost components that are beyond our control could significantly increase the costs of our self-insured medical plans and postretirement medical costs, or require us to adjust the level of benefits offered to our employees. In addition, if we lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event.\nWe have programs in place with multiple surety companies for the issuance of unsecured surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program for workers\u2019 compensation and third-party casualty. Estimates made by the states and the surety companies of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, and we may be required to maintain secured surety bonds in the future which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements.\nIncreased insurance premium costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur recent insurance renewals did not result in significant changes in premiums; however, insurance carriers may increase premiums for many companies, including transportation companies, in the coming years. We could also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums in the future if our claims experience worsens. If our insurance or claims expense increases and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. The costs of compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials and similar matters. We may transport or arrange for the transportation of hazardous materials and explosives and we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. At certain ABF Freight facilities, we store fuel in underground and aboveground tanks and/or we operate with non-discharge certifications or storm water permits under the federal Clean Water Act. Our operations involve the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to cleanup costs and liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of our applicable insurance coverage, including substantial fines, civil penalties, or civil and criminal liability, as well as bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, if any damage or injury occurs as a result of our transportation of hazardous materials or explosives, we may be subject to claims from third parties and bear liability for such damage or injury.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nConcern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and some form of federal, state, or regional climate change legislation is possible in the future. We are unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future climate change legislation. However, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could result in increases in these and other costs. Increased regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions, including diesel engine emissions and/or total vehicle fuel economy, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. We are also subject to increasing customer sensitivity to sustainability issues, and we may be subject to additional requirements related to customer-led initiatives or their efforts to comply with environmental programs. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure or our operating results. Furthermore, although we are committed to mandatory and voluntary sustainability practices, increased awareness and any adverse publicity about greenhouse gas emissions emitted by companies in the transportation industry could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our services.\nThe engines used in our newer tractors are subject to recent emissions-control regulations, which could substantially increase operating expenses.\nIn August 2011, the EPA and the NHTSA established a national program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and establish new fuel efficiency standards for commercial vehicles, and the new design requirements became effective for 2014 model tractor engines extending through model year 2018. The EPA and the NHTSA will be determining the details of the second phase of the fuel economy and greenhouse gas reduction from heavy-duty engines. Greenhouse gas emissions regulations are likely to impact equipment design and cost. A number of states have mandated, and states may continue to individually mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment which could increase equipment costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. Further equipment price increases may result from these federal and state requirements. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. If we are unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFollowing EPA-mandated tractor engine design requirements intended to reduce emissions which became effective on January 1, 2007, more restrictive EPA emission-control design requirements became effective for engines built on or after January 1, 2010. Engine manufacturers have made adjustments to the operating software, since the introduction of the 2010 EPA-compliant engines, that have resulted in slightly improved fuel economy and some early-life cycle reduction in maintenance cost per mile compared to the 2007 EPA-compliant engines; however, the 2010 engines are generally less fuel-efficient and the maintenance costs have proven to be markedly higher in comparison to the pre-2007 EPA engines.\nFuture regulation of other environmental matters, including potential limits on carbon emissions under climate-change legislation, could also negatively impact our business and profitability if enacted. ABF Freight\u2019s costs to acquire and maintain compliant equipment could increase substantially. Reduced fuel demand due to improved fuel economy may result in legislative efforts to increase fuel taxes which, if enacted, could significantly increase our costs. If we are not able to adequately increase our freight rates, recover fuel surcharges, or recognize fuel economy savings to offset increases in equipment and maintenance costs, and if we are not able to offset fuel tax increases through reductions in other excise taxes or through increases in the rates we charge our customers, our business, results of operations, and financial position could be adversely affected.\nIncreased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn recent years, manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to increased costs of materials and, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine and emissions system design requirements mandated by the EPA, which are intended to reduce emissions. More restrictive EPA engine and emissions system design requirements became effective for engines built on or after January 1, 2010. In August 2011, the EPA and the NHTSA established a national program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and establish new fuel efficiency standards for commercial vehicles beginning in model year 2014 and extending through model year 2018. In February 2014, President Obama announced that the EPA and the NHTSA will begin work determining the details of the second phase of the fuel economy and greenhouse gas reduction from heavy-duty engines, such as those operated in ABF Freight\u2019s tractors. Greenhouse gas emissions regulations are likely to impact equipment design and cost. A number of states have mandated, and states may continue to individually mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment which could increase equipment costs for entire fleets that operate in\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\ninterstate commerce. Further equipment price increases may result from these federal and state requirements. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. If we are unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDuring prolonged periods of decreased tonnage levels, we may make strategic fleet reductions in our ABF Freight operations and, other trucking companies may reduce fleet levels during recessionary economic cycles, which could result in an increase in the supply of used equipment. When the supply exceeds the demand for used revenue equipment, the general market value of used revenue equipment decreases. If market prices for used revenue equipment decline, corresponding decreases in our established salvage values on equipment being used in our ABF Freight operations would increase our depreciation expense, and we could incur impairment losses on assets held for sale which could have an adverse effect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply. From time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due, for example, to lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. Component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet OEM demand, creating periodic difficulty for OEMs to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment and/or increased demand for replacement components as economic conditions change. At times, market forces may create market situations in which demand outstrips supply. In those situations, we may face reduced supply levels and/or increased acquisition costs. An inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers for our ABF Freight operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur total assets include goodwill and intangibles. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, our earnings could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had recorded goodwill of $77.1 million and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $72.8 million, both primarily as a result of the June 15, 2012 acquisition of Panther. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently, if indicators of impairment exist. Finite-lived intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the impairment evaluations for goodwill and intangible assets indicate the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Our annual impairment evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were performed as of October 1, 2014, 2013 and 2012, and it was determined that there was no impairment of the recorded balances.\nPanther is evaluated as a separate reporting unit for the impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets. Significant declines in business levels or other changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations of Panther could result in impairment and a resulting non-cash write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain our corporate reputation and the ABF, Panther, and U-Pack brands, our business may suffer.\nABF Freight is recognized as an industry leader for its commitment to quality, customer service, safety, and technology. Our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ABF brand as it applies to both ABF Freight and ABF Logistics. The Panther brand is also synonymous with premium service. Service, performance, and safety issues, whether actual or perceived and whether as a result of our actions or those of our third-party contract carriers and their drivers and owner operators, could adversely impact our customers\u2019 image of the ABF companies, Panther, and U-Pack and result in the loss of business. Adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, environmental concerns, and similar matters, which are connected to ABF Freight, whether or not justified, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships, as well as hinder the growth of our non-asset-based businesses. Our business and our image could also be negatively impacted by a breach of our corporate policies by employees or vendors. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nOur initiatives to grow our business operations may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful.\nDeveloping service offerings requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure, including operating and management information systems. Depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from our growth initiatives, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional service offerings may not be achieved. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial position may be adversely affected.\nWe also face challenges and risks in implementing initiatives to manage our cost structure to business levels. We periodically evaluate and modify the ABF Freight network to reflect changes in customer demands and to reconcile ABF Freight\u2019s infrastructure with tonnage levels and the proximity of customer freight, and there can be no assurances that these network changes, to the extent such network changes are made, will result in a material improvement of ABF Freight\u2019s results of operations.\nOur growth plans place significant demands on our management and operating personnel and we may not be able to hire, train, and retain the appropriate personnel to manage and grow these services. In addition, as we focus on growing our non-asset-based businesses, we may encounter difficulties in adapting our corporate structure or in developing and maintaining effective partnerships among our operating segments which could hinder our operational, financial, and strategic objectives. Furthermore, we may invest significant resources to enter or expand our services in markets with established competitors, and we may not be able to successfully gain market share which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nWe may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions.\nWe evaluate acquisition candidates from time to time and may acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business or enhance our service offerings. Acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. We may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from the operation of an acquired business to offset our acquisition or investment costs. The degree of success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and growth opportunities. Our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends in part upon the successful integration of any acquired businesses. The possible difficulties of integration include, among others: retention of customers and key employees; unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of information, communications, and other systems; difficulties managing businesses that are outside our historical core competency; inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with potentially new markets or geographic areas and new assets and the businesses associated with them; consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures; the effect on internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities. The diversion of management\u2019s attention from our current operations to the acquired operations and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Also, following an acquisition, we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions. If acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows, we may incur impairments of goodwill and intangible and other assets in the future.\nOur results of operations could be impacted by seasonal fluctuations or adverse weather conditions.\nOur operations are impacted by seasonal fluctuations which affect tonnage and shipment levels and, consequently, revenues and operating results. Freight shipments and operating costs of the ABF Freight and ABF Logistics operating segments can be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions, and the first quarter of each year generally has the lowest tonnage levels. Expedited shipments of the Panther segment may decline due to post-holiday slowdowns during winter months and plant shutdowns during summer months. Emergency roadside service events of the FleetNet segment are influenced by seasonal variations, and service event volume is generally lower during mild weather conditions. Business levels of the ABF Moving segment are generally lower in the non-summer months when demand for moving services is typically lower. Climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions, which could adversely affect our freight shipments and level of services provided by our non-asset-based segments and, consequently, our operating results.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nWe are subject to certain risks arising from our international business.\nWe provide transportation and logistics services to and from international locations and are, therefore, subject to risks of international business, including, but not limited to, changes in the economic strength of certain foreign countries; social, political, and economic instability; the ability to secure space on third-party aircraft, ocean vessels, and other modes of transportation; burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and United States regulations and export and import laws as well as different liability standards and less developed legal systems; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; and changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition, natural disasters, pandemics, and insurrections could impede our ability to provide satisfactory services to customers in international locations.\nWe are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and hold Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (\u201cC-TPAT\u2019) status for our ABF Freight and Panther segments. Failure to comply with the FCPA and local regulations in the conduct of our international business operations may result in legal claims against us. If we are unable to maintain our C-TPAT status, we may face a loss of certain business due to customer requirements to deal only with C-TPAT participating carriers, because of the enhanced levels of supply chain security provided by participating in the C-TPAT program. In addition, loss of C-TPAT status for Panther, may result in significant border delays for the segment, which could cause its international operations to be less efficient than competitors also operating internationally. We also face additional risks associated with our foreign operations, including restrictive trade policies and imposition of duties, taxes, or government royalties imposed by foreign governments. These and other factors that substantially affect the operations of our international business could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our global service offerings.\nOur business could be harmed by antiterrorism measures.\nAs a result of actual or threatened terrorist attacks on the United States, federal, state, and municipal authorities have implemented and may implement in the future various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Although many companies would be adversely affected by any slowdown in the availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our business disproportionately. For example, we offer specialized services that guarantee on-time delivery. If security measures disrupt the timing of deliveries, we could fail to meet the needs of our customers or could incur increased costs in order to do so. Additional security measures may also reduce productivity of our drivers and third-party transportation service providers, which would increase our operating costs. There can be no assurance that new antiterrorism measures will not be implemented and that such new measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and our amended and restated bylaws, as amended, may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the Company or a merger in which the Company is not the surviving company and may otherwise prevent or slow changes in our Board of Directors and management. In addition, because the Company is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions could discourage an acquisition of the Company or other change in control transaction and thereby negatively affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 77595, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "ARCB"}
