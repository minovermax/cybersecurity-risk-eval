{"cik": "1593936", "company": "Michaels Companies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nOur business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. The risks described below are those we believe are the material risks we face. Any of the risk factors described below, as well as risks not currently known to us, could significantly and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or access to sources of financing.\nRisks related to our business and industry\nWe face risks related to the effect of economic uncertainty.\nIn the event of an economic downturn or slow recovery, our growth prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Our stores offer arts and crafts supplies and products for the crafter and custom framing for the do-it-yourself home decorator, which are viewed as discretionary items. Pressure on discretionary income brought on by economic downturns and slow recoveries, including housing market declines, rising energy prices and weak labor markets, may cause consumers to reduce the amount they spend on discretionary items. The inherent uncertainty related to predicting economic conditions makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand trends, which could cause us to purchase excess inventories, resulting in increases in our inventory carrying cost, or limit our ability to satisfy customer demand and potentially lose market share.\nChanges in customer demand could materially adversely affect our sales, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for products and supplies used in creative activities. If we misjudge the market, we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns, or experience shortages of key items, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flow. In addition, adverse weather\nconditions, economic instability and consumer confidence volatility could have material adverse impacts on our sales and operating results.\nCompetition, including internet-based competition, could negatively impact our business.\nThe retail arts and crafts industry, including custom framing, is competitive, which could result in pressure to reduce prices and losses in our market share. We must remain competitive in the areas of quality, price, breadth of selection, customer service and convenience to retain and grow our market share. We compete with mass merchants, which dedicate a portion of their selling space to a limited selection of craft supplies and seasonal and holiday merchandise, along with national and regional chains and local merchants. We also compete with specialty retailers, which include Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. and Jo-Ann Stores, Inc., among others. Some of our competitors, particularly the mass merchants, are larger and have greater financial resources than we do. We also face competition from internet-based retailers, such as Amazon.com, Inc., among others, in addition to traditional store-based retailers, who may be larger, more experienced and able to offer products we cannot. This could result in increased price competition since our customers could more readily search and compare non-private brand products. Furthermore, we ultimately compete with alternative sources of entertainment and leisure for our customers.\nA weak fourth quarter would materially adversely affect our result of operations.\nOur business is highly seasonal. Our inventories and short-term borrowings may grow in the third fiscal quarter as we prepare for our peak selling season in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Our most important quarter in terms of sales, profitability and cash flow has historically been the fourth fiscal quarter. If for any reason our fourth fiscal quarter results were substantially below expectations, our operating results for the full year would be materially adversely affected, and we could have substantial excess inventory, especially in seasonal merchandise, that is difficult to liquidate.\nUnexpected or unfavorable consumer responses to our promotional or merchandising programs could have a materially adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nBrand recognition, quality and price have a significant influence on consumers\u2019 choices among competing products and brands. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and the cadence of new product introductions also have a significant impact on consumers\u2019 buying decisions. If we misjudge consumer responses to our existing or future promotional activities, this could have a material adverse impact on our sales, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe believe improvements in our merchandise offering help drive sales at our stores. If we experience poor execution of changes to our merchandise offering or experience unexpected consumer responses to changes in our merchandise offering, our sales, results of operations and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nWe increasingly depend on e-commerce, and our failure to successfully manage this business and deliver a convenient omnichannel shopping experience to our customers could have an adverse effect on our growth strategy and our sales, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nExpanding our e-commerce business, particularly in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is an important part of our strategy to grow through our omnichannel operations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related stay-at-home orders, we have experienced a significant increase in demand through our e-commerce channels. There can be no assurances that this increase in demand will be sustained through the remainder of the pandemic or in subsequent periods. In addition, dependence on our e-commerce business subjects us to certain other risks, including:\n\u25cf the failure to successfully implement new systems, system enhancements and internet platforms;\n\u25cf the failure of our technology infrastructure or the computer systems that operate our website, causing, among other things, website downtimes, telecommunications issues or other technical failures;\n\u25cf over-reliance on third-parties; and\n\u25cf an increase in credit card fraud.\nOur failure to successfully address and respond to these risks and uncertainties could negatively impact sales, increase costs, diminish our growth prospects and damage the reputation of our brand, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nEvolving foreign trade policy (including tariffs imposed on certain foreign-made goods) may adversely affect our business.\nOur products are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers, including from suppliers overseas, particularly in China. In addition, some of the products that we purchase from vendors in the U.S. also depend, in whole or in part, on suppliers located outside the U.S. In 2018 and 2019, the U.S. imposed significant tariffs on various products imported from China, including certain products we source from China. If additional tariffs are imposed on our products, or other retaliatory trade measures are taken, our costs could increase and we may be required to raise our prices. Further, efforts to mitigate this tariff risk, including a shift of production to outside of China, could result in increased costs and disruption to our operations. These potential outcomes could result in the loss of customers and adversely affect our operating performance. To mitigate tariff risks with China, we may also seek to shift production outside of China, which could result in increased costs and disruption to our operations.\nOur reliance on foreign suppliers increases our risk of not obtaining adequate, timely and cost-effective product supplies.\nTo a significant extent, we rely on foreign manufacturers for our merchandise, particularly manufacturers located in China. In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources. This reliance increases the risk that we will not have adequate and timely supplies of various products due to local political, economic, social or environmental conditions (including acts of terrorism, the outbreak of war or the occurrence of a natural disaster), transportation delays (including dock strikes and other work stoppages), restrictive actions by foreign governments, or changes in U.S. laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution. Reliance on foreign manufacturers also increases our exposure to trade infringement claims and reduces our ability to return product for various reasons.\nWe are at a risk for higher costs associated with goods manufactured in China. Significant increases in wages or wage taxes paid by contract facilities may increase the cost of goods manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and profitability.\nAll of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the U.S. are subject to duties collected by the U.S. Customs Service. We may be subjected to additional duties or tariffs, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import, or the loss of import privileges if we or our suppliers are found to be in violation of U.S. laws and regulations applicable to the importation of our products.\nOur results have been, and the future, may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events, including public health issues, geo-political events and weather.\nUnforeseen public health issues, such as pandemics and epidemics, and geo-political events, such as civil unrest in a country in which our suppliers are located or terrorist or military activities disrupting transportation, communication or utility systems, as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, particularly during peak seasonal periods, could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors, or could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution facilities located in the affected areas. For example, day-to-day operations, particularly our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores, could be adversely affected, or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by the affected distribution center. These factors could also cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets and economy. These or other occurrences could significantly impact our operating results and financial performance.\nOur business has been, and could be in the future, adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn late 2019, a new strain of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was detected in Wuhan, China and other jurisdictions and has since spread to other parts of the world, including the U.S. In an effort to mitigate the continued spread of the virus, federal, state and local governments, as well as certain private entities, mandated various restrictions, including stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. As a result of these restrictions, a significant number of our stores were temporarily closed. Accordingly, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we experienced significant decreases in demand for our products and a corresponding negative impact on our net sales. There remains significant uncertainty surrounding the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and future waves of the pandemic could require us to close stores again if certain restrictions are reinstated by state and local authorities. As such, we are unable to accurately predict the future impact that the pandemic will have on our results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Additional potential future impacts include those related to:\n\u25cf our ability to meet obligations to our business partners, including our Amended Revolving Credit Facility and lease obligations;\n\u25cf the failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, to meet their obligations to us, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties, travel restrictions and border closures, or disruptions with sourcing raw materials, manufacturing, delivery, shipping, exports, imports, and in our supply chains;\n\u25cf the impact on our workforce, including limitations on travel and work locations, quarantines, pay reductions and temporary leaves of absence;\n\u25cf the continued cancellation of group events at our stores;\n\u25cf any additional government and regulatory restrictions that limit or close operating facilities, including our stores, or restrict operations of our business partners, suppliers or customers; and\n\u25cf credit availability and cost due to disruptions and volatility in the financial markets.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will be dependent on, among other things, the duration of quarantines and other global travel restrictions, the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak and the public\u2019s response to the outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening other risks factors discussed within this Form 10-K.\nWe have experienced a data breach in the past and any future failure to adequately maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information could result in an additional data breach which could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nThe protection of our customer, team members and Company data is critically important to us. Our customers and team members have a high expectation that we will adequately safeguard and protect their sensitive personal information. We have become increasingly centralized and dependent upon automated information technology processes. In addition, a large portion of our business operations is conducted electronically, increasing the risk of attack or interception that could cause loss or misuse of data, system failures or disruption of operations. Improper activities by third parties, exploitation of encryption technology, new data-hacking tools and discoveries and other events or developments may result in a future compromise or breach of our networks, payment card terminals or other payment systems. In particular, the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target; accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Any failure to maintain the security of our customers\u2019 sensitive information, or data belonging to ourselves or our suppliers, could put us at a competitive disadvantage, result in deterioration of our customers\u2019 confidence in us, and subject us to potential litigation, liability, fines and penalties, resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer a criminal attack\nin the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal information, or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions, or our information systems may prove inadequate, resulting in damage to our reputation, business operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business, including our perpetual inventory, automated replenishment and weighted-average cost stock ledger systems which are necessary to properly forecast, manage, analyze and record our inventory. The Company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to our online services and preclude store transactions. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, transactions processing and financial reporting. Additionally, we may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to adequately upgrade, maintain and expand our systems.\nOur growth depends on our ability to increase comparable store sales and to optimize our store portfolio.\nWe anticipate our sales growth will primarily come from increasing comparable store sales. Profitable growth would then depend significantly on our ability to improve gross margin. Another business strategy is to continue to optimize our portfolio of retail stores. We may be unable to continue our store growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable sites for additional or relocating stores, negotiate acceptable leases, access sufficient capital to support store growth, or hire and train a sufficient number of qualified team members. If we are unable to accomplish these strategies, our ability to increase our sales, profitability and cash flow could be impaired.\nDamage to the reputation of the Michaels brand or our private and exclusive brands could adversely affect our sales.\nWe believe the Michaels brand name and many of our private and exclusive brand names are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. To be successful in the future, we must continue to preserve, grow and utilize the value of Michaels reputation. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents may erode trust and confidence. In addition, we develop and promote private and exclusive brands, which we believe have national recognition. Our Michaels private brands totaled approximately 59% of net sales in fiscal 2020. Damage to the reputations (whether or not justified) of our brand names could arise from product failures, data privacy or security incidents, litigation or various forms of adverse publicity (including adverse publicity generated as a result of a vendor\u2019s or a supplier\u2019s failure to comply with general social accountability practices), especially in social media outlets, and may generate negative customer sentiment, potentially resulting in a reduction in our sales and earnings.\nWe face risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and transitioning to other qualified vendors could materially adversely affect our revenue and profit growth.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. Global sourcing has become an increasingly important part of our business, as we have undertaken efforts to increase the amount of product we source directly from overseas manufacturers. Our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Any issues related to transitioning vendors could adversely affect our revenue and gross profit.\nMany of our suppliers are small firms that produce a limited number of items. Given their limited resources, these firms are susceptible to cash flow issues, access to capital, production difficulties, quality control issues and problems in delivering agreed-upon quantities on schedule. We may not be able, if necessary, to return products to these suppliers and obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain reimbursement or indemnification from them if their products prove defective. These suppliers may also be unable to withstand a downturn in economic conditions. Significant failures on the part of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, many of these suppliers require extensive advance notice of our requirements to supply products in the quantities we desire. This long lead time may limit our ability to respond timely to shifts in demand.\nChanges in regulations or enforcement, or our failure to comply with existing or future regulations, may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local regulations with respect to our operations in the U.S. We are further subject to federal, provincial and local regulations internationally, including in Canada and China, each of which are distinct from those in the U.S., and may be subject to greater international regulation as our business expands. There are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives that could adversely impact our business if they are enacted or enforced. Those initiatives include wage or workforce issues (such as minimum-wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements), collective bargaining matters, environmental regulation, price and promotion regulation, trade regulations and others.\nChanges in tax regulations may also change our effective tax rate as our business is subject to a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. New accounting pronouncements and interpretations of existing accounting rules and practices have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in accounting standards or tax regulations can have a significant effect on our reported results of operations.\nFailure to comply with legal requirements could result in, among other things, increased litigation risk that could affect us adversely by subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies or by increasing our litigation expenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. We are currently subject to various class action lawsuits alleging violations of wage and workforce laws and similar matters. If such issues become more expensive to address, or if new issues arise, they could increase our expenses, generate negative publicity, or otherwise adversely affect us.\nOur marketing programs, e-commerce initiatives and use of consumer information are governed by an evolving set of laws and enforcement trends and unfavorable changes in those laws or trends, or our failure to comply with existing or future laws, could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe collect, maintain and use data provided to us through our loyalty program, online activities and other customer interactions in our business. Our current and future marketing programs depend on our ability to collect, maintain and use this information, and our ability to do so is subject to certain contractual restrictions in third-party contracts as well as evolving international, federal and state laws and enforcement trends. We strive to comply with all applicable laws and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, including those relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, may conflict with other rules or may conflict with our practices. If so, we may suffer damage to our reputation and be subject to proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts to defend our practices, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business and result in monetary liability.\nIn addition, as data privacy and marketing laws change, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance with such laws. If applicable data privacy and marketing laws become more restrictive at the international, federal or state level, our compliance costs may increase, our ability to effectively engage customers via personalized marketing may decrease, our investment in our e-commerce platform may not be fully realized, our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security breaches may increase.\nProduct recalls and/or product liability, as well as changes in product safety and other consumer protection laws, may adversely impact our operations, merchandise offerings, reputation, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe are subject to regulations by a variety of federal, state and international regulatory authorities, including the Consumer Product Safety Commission. In fiscal 2020, we purchased merchandise from approximately 600 vendors. Since a majority of our merchandise is manufactured in foreign countries, one or more of our vendors may not adhere to product safety requirements or our quality control standards, and we may not identify the deficiency before merchandise ships to our stores. Any issues of product safety, including but not limited to those manufactured in foreign countries, could cause us to recall some of those products. If our vendors fail to manufacture or import merchandise that adheres to our quality control standards, our reputation and brands could be damaged, potentially leading to increases in customer litigation\nagainst us. Furthermore, to the extent we are unable to replace any recalled products, we may have to reduce our merchandise offerings, resulting in a decrease in sales, especially if a recall occurs near or during a seasonal period. If our vendors are unable or unwilling to recall products failing to meet our quality standards, we may be required to recall those products at a substantial cost to us. Moreover, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs to us for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. Long lead times on merchandise ordering cycles increase the difficulty for us to plan and prepare for potential changes to applicable laws. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 imposes significant requirements on manufacturing, importing, testing and labeling requirements for our products. In the event that we are unable to timely comply with regulatory changes or regulators do not believe we are complying with current regulations applicable to us, significant fines or penalties could result and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nSignificant increases in inflation or commodity prices, such as petroleum, natural gas, electricity, steel, wood and paper, may adversely affect our costs, including cost of merchandise.\nSignificant future increases in commodity prices or inflation could adversely affect our costs, including cost of merchandise and distribution costs. Furthermore, the transportation industry may experience a shortage or reduction of capacity, which could be exacerbated by higher fuel prices. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to secure, or are able to secure only at significantly higher costs, adequate transportation resources to fulfill our receipt of goods or delivery schedules to the stores.\nImprovements to our supply chain may not be fully successful.\nAn important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies, cost reductions and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to our supply chain, including merchandise ordering, transportation, direct sourcing initiatives and receipt processing. We continue to implement enhancements to our distribution systems and processes, which are designed to improve efficiency throughout the supply chain and at our stores. If we are unable to successfully implement significant changes, this could disrupt our supply chain, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. and Canadian dollar, which is the functional currency of our Canadian subsidiaries.\nOur Canadian operating subsidiaries purchase inventory in U.S. dollars, which is sold in Canadian dollars and exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, our customers at border locations can be sensitive to cross-border price differences. Substantial foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our business. In fiscal 2020, exchange rates had a positive impact on our consolidated operating results due to a 4% increase in the Canadian exchange rate.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture.\nThe market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel for all areas of our organization, including our CEO, the other members of our senior leadership team, buyers, distribution center and other team members. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, competitors\u2019 hiring practices, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Many of our store level team members are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and governmental labor and employment requirements. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we fail to increase our wages competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline, causing our customer service to suffer, while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease.\nIf we do not continue to attract, train and retain quality team members, our performance could be adversely affected. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our existing employees\nand to attract new employees. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and attracting new key personnel, we may not be able to meet our business plan and, as a result, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nAny difficulty executing or integrating an acquisition, a business combination or a major business initiative could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nAny difficulty in executing or integrating an acquisition, a business combination or a major business initiative may result in our inability to achieve anticipated benefits from these transactions in the time frame that we anticipate, or at all, which could adversely affect our business or results of operations. Such transactions may also disrupt the operation of our current activities and divert management's attention from other business matters. In addition, the Company\u2019s current credit agreements place certain limited constraints on our ability to make an acquisition or enter into a business combination, and future borrowing agreements could place tighter constraints on such actions.\nOur total assets include intangible assets, goodwill and substantial amounts of property and equipment. Changes in estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of these assets, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain store locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operation.\nOur total assets include intangible assets, goodwill and substantial amounts of property and equipment. We make certain estimates and projections in connection with impairment analyses for these long-lived assets, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 360, \"Property, Plant and Equipment\", and ASC 350, \"Intangibles-Goodwill and Other\". We also review the carrying value of these assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset, asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value. These calculations require us to make a number of estimates and projections of future results. If these estimates or projections change, we may be required to record additional impairment charges on certain of these assets. If these impairment charges are significant, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods, which subject us to various financial risks.\nWe lease virtually all of our store, distribution center and administrative locations, generally for long terms. While we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions by making specified payments, we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so. If we decide to close stores, we are generally required to continue paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term, or pay to exercise rights to terminate, and the performance of any of these obligations may be costly. When we assign or sublease vacated locations, we may remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform. In addition, when leases for the stores in our ongoing operations expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, which could cause us to close stores. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with leasing real estate, which can have a material adverse effect on our results.\nWe have co-sourced certain of our information technology, accounts payable, accounting, human resource and other functions and may co-source other administrative functions, which makes us more dependent upon third parties.\nWe place significant reliance on third-party providers for the co-sourcing of certain of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d), accounts payable, payroll, accounting, human resource and other functions. This co-sourcing initiative is a component of our ongoing strategy to increase efficiencies, manage our costs and seek additional cost savings. These functions are generally performed in offshore locations. As a result, we rely on third parties to ensure that certain functional needs are sufficiently met. This reliance subjects us to risks arising from the loss of control over these processes, changes in pricing that may affect our operating results, and potentially, termination of provision of these services by our suppliers. If our service providers fail to perform, we may have difficulty arranging for an alternate supplier or rebuilding our own internal resources, and we could incur significant costs, all of which may have a significant adverse effect on our business. We may co-source other administrative functions in the future, which would further increase our reliance on third parties. Further, the use of offshore service providers may expose us to risks related to local political, economic, social or environmental conditions (including acts of terrorism, the outbreak of war, or the occurrence of natural disaster), restrictive actions by foreign governments or changes in U.S. laws and regulations.\nRisks related to our substantial indebtedness\nWe face risks related to our substantial indebtedness.\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our senior notes, senior secured notes and credit facilities. As of January 30, 2021, we had total outstanding debt of $2,536.7 million, of which $1,661.7 million was subject to variable interest rates and $875.0 million was subject to fixed interest rates. In April 2018, we executed two interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $1 billion which are intended to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates for borrowings under our term loan credit facility with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJPMorgan\u201d) and other lenders (\u201cAmended Term Loan Credit Facility\u201d). As a result of these interest rate swaps, our exposure to interest rate volatility for $1 billion of our Amended Term Loan Credit Facility was eliminated. In addition, during fiscal 2020, we executed two interest rate cap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $1.3 billion associated with our outstanding Amended Term Loan Credit Facility. The interest rate caps will effectively cap our LIBOR exposure on a portion of the Amended Term Loan Credit Facility at 1%. As of January 30, 2021, we had $536.8 million of additional borrowing capacity (after giving effect to $87.3 million of letters of credit then outstanding) under our Amended Revolving Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and other lenders. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u25cf making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, and any failure to comply with the obligations under our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, selling and marketing efforts, product development, future business opportunities and other purposes;\n\u25cf exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our Amended Revolving Credit Facility and our Amended Term Loan Credit Facility (collectively defined as the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d), are at variable rates;\n\u25cf restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; or\n\u25cf limiting our ability to plan for, or adjust to, changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less highly leveraged.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nFurther, a substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. It is unknown whether SOFR or any potential alternative reference rate will attain market acceptance as replacements for LIBOR and, as such, the potential effect on our results from operations is unknown.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject, in the case of MSI and Michaels Funding, Inc. (\u201cHoldings\u201d) and their subsidiaries, to the restrictions contained in our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes and our senior secured notes. In addition, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and indentures governing our senior notes and our senior secured notes do not restrict us from creating new holding companies that may be able to incur indebtedness without regard to the restrictions set forth in our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and indentures governing our senior notes and our senior secured notes. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes and our senior secured notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit the ability of the relevant borrowers, issuers, guarantors and their restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u25cf incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u25cf pay dividends or distributions on their capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire their capital stock or indebtedness;\n\u25cf issue stock of subsidiaries;\n\u25cf make certain investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;\n\u25cf create liens on their assets;\n\u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf merge or consolidate with another company; or\n\u25cf sell or otherwise transfer assets.\nIn addition, under the Amended Term Loan Credit Facility and the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, MSI is required to meet specified financial ratios in order to undertake certain actions, and under certain circumstances, MSI may be required to maintain a specified fixed charge coverage ratio under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to meet those requirements can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you we will meet them. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which could also lead to an event of default under our senior notes or our senior secured notes if any of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities were accelerated. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of our senior secured notes could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Holdings, MSI and certain of MSI\u2019s subsidiaries have pledged substantially all of their assets, including the capital stock of MSI and certain of its subsidiaries, as collateral securing our obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and senior secured notes. If the indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, our senior notes or our senior secured notes were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock\nCertain stockholders have the ability to strongly influence our decisions and their interest may conflict with yours or those of our Company.\nAffiliates of, or funds advised by, Bain Capital Private Equity, L.P. (\u201cBain Capital\u201d) beneficially owned approximately 37% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of January 30, 2021. As long as Bain Capital continues to hold a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, they will be able to strongly influence our decisions, and their interests may conflict with yours or those of our Company.\nBecause our executive officers hold or may hold restricted shares or option awards that will vest upon a change of control, these officers may have interests in us that conflict with yours.\nOur executive officers hold or may hold restricted shares and options to purchase shares that would automatically vest upon a change of control. As a result, these officers may view certain change of control transactions more favorably than an investor due to the vesting opportunities available to them and, as a result, may have an economic incentive to support a transaction that may not be viewed as favorable by other stockholders.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than you paid.\nWe plan to retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur, including our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In addition, the Apollo Merger Agreement generally restricts our ability to pay dividends on our common stock during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the completion of the transaction (or the date on which the Merger Agreement is earlier terminated). As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than you paid.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may deter takeover efforts that may be beneficial to stockholder value.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it harder for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include limitations on our stockholders\u2019 ability to act by written consent. In addition, our Board has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval that could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer. Our certificate of incorporation imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock other than Bain Capital, who owned approximately 37% of our outstanding common stock as of January 30, 2021. As a result, you may lose your ability to sell your stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of the Company may be unsuccessful.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or the bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThis choice of forum provision is not intended to apply to any actions brought under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d). The exclusive forum provision will\nnot apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nRisks related to the proposed acquisition by Apollo\nThe announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement entered into by the Company and Apollo may adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nUncertainty about the effect of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on our employees, customers, and other parties may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations regardless of whether the proposed transaction is completed. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following, all of which could be increased by a delay in or abandonment of the proposed transaction:\n\u25cf our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees, including key personnel, could be impaired;\n\u25cf significant management time and resources could be diverted to the consummation of the proposed transaction;\n\u25cf relationships with customers, suppliers, and other business partners could be affected;\n\u25cf certain business decisions by our customers, suppliers, and other business partners could be delayed or changed;\n\u25cf we may not be able to pursue alternative business opportunities or make appropriate changes to our business;\n\u25cf litigation relating to the proposed transaction could arise; and\n\u25cf significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed transaction have been and may continue to be incurred.\nFailure to consummate the proposed transaction with Apollo within the expected timeframe, or at all, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the proposed acquisition will be consummated. The consummation of the proposed acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions, including a majority of the outstanding shares of Michaels common stock having been tendered and not validly withdrawn, the expiration of a twenty-five day go-shop period, compliance with certain antitrust requirements in the United States and Canada, the completion of a specified marketing period for Apollo\u2019s debt financing of the offer price, and other customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that these and other conditions to closing will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all.\nThe Merger Agreement also provides that the acquisition agreement may be terminated by us or Apollo under certain circumstances, and in certain specified circumstances upon termination of the Merger Agreement we will be required to pay Apollo a termination fee of up to $104 million. If we are required to make this payment, doing so would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn abandonment of the transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us among our customers, suppliers or in the investment and business community in general. Further, any disruptions to our business resulting from the proposed acquisition, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, partners, suppliers and employees, could continue or accelerate in the event of abandonment of the transaction. In addition, if the proposed acquisition is not completed, and there are no other parties willing and able to acquire the Company at a price of $22.00 per share or higher, on terms acceptable to us, the share price of our common stock will likely decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the proposed acquisition will be completed. Also, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed acquisition. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the proposed acquisition is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the proposed acquisition.", "PERMNO": 53381, "SIC": 5945, "TIC": "MIK"}
