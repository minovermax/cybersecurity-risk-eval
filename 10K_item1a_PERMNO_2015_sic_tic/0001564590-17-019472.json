{"cik": "1564709", "company": "Truett-Hurst, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-10-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nA reduction in the supply of grapes and bulk wine available to us from the independent grape growers and bulk wine suppliers could reduce the Company\u2019s annual production of wine.\nThe Company relies on annual contracts with independent growers to purchase substantially all of the grapes used in wine production. The business would be harmed if the Company is unable to contract for the purchase of grapes at acceptable prices from these or other suppliers in the future. The terms of many of the Company\u2019s purchase agreements also constrain the ability to discontinue purchasing grapes in circumstances where the Company might want to do so.\nSome of these agreements provide that either party may terminate the agreement prior to the beginning of each harvest year.\nThe Company depends on various bulk wine suppliers for the production of several wines, particularly the direct to retailer designated labels. These contracts currently cover the 2017-2019 harvests. Extension of these contracts is not guaranteed and thus the Company may have exposure to the availability and pricing of bulk wine for its production needs which could increase the cost or reduce the amount of wine the Company is able to produce for sale in the future. This could reduce sales and profits.\nThe Company faces inventory risk, and if it fails to predict accurately demand for products, the Company may face write-downs or other charges.\nThe Company is exposed to inventory risks that may adversely affect operating results as a result of new product launches, changes in product cycles and pricing, limited shelf-life of certain of the Company\u2019s products, changes in consumer demand, and other factors. The Company endeavors to predict accurately, based on information from distributors and reasonable assumptions, the expected demand for their products in order to avoid overproduction. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time of production and the date of sale. It may be more difficult to make accurate predictions regarding new products. In part, the Company depends on the marketing initiatives and efforts of distributors in promoting products and creating consumer demand and the Company has limited or no control regarding its promotional initiatives or the success of their efforts.\nThe Company has a history of losses, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nThe Company has had a limited number of quarters or years of profitability and historically raised additional capital to meet its growth needs. The Company expects to make significant investments in order to develop and expand its business, which, it believes, will result in additional sales, marketing and general and administrative expenses that will require increased sales to recover these additional costs. As a public company, the Company expects to continue to incur legal, accounting, and other administrative expenses that are material. The Company\u2019s revenue has been subject to volatility in recent periods and this volatility may cause the Company to not cover its costs and successfully compete in the highly competitive wine market.\nThe Company may not generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability. The Company may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for its products and increasing competition, as well as the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown factors in the expansion of the business. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and, may incur significant losses in the future, and this could cause the price of the Class A common stock to decline.\nThe Company faces significant competition which could adversely affect profitability.\nThe wine industry is intensely competitive. The Company\u2019s wines compete in several super-premium and ultra-premium wine market segments with many other super-premium and ultra-premium domestic and foreign wines, with imported wines coming from the Burgundy and Bordeaux regions of France, as well as Italy, Chile, Argentina, South Africa and Australia. The Company\u2019s wines also compete with other alcoholic and, to a lesser degree, non-alcoholic beverages, for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by independent distributors, many of which carry extensive brand portfolios. As a result of this intense competition there has been and may continue to be upward pressure on selling and promotional expenses. In addition, the wine industry has experienced significant consolidation. Many competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations resources. The Company\u2019s sales may be harmed to the extent it is not able to compete successfully against such wine or alternative beverage producers\u2019 costs. There can be no assurance that in the future the Company will be able to successfully compete with current competitors or that it will not face greater competition from other wineries and beverage manufacturers.\nBecause a significant amount of the Company\u2019s business is made through retail exclusive model any change in relationships with the retail partners could harm the business.\nThe Company\u2019s agreements with direct retail partners are informal and therefore subject to change. If one or more of the direct retail partners chose to purchase fewer products, or the Company is forced to reduce the prices, the Company\u2019s sales and profits would be reduced and the business would be harmed.\nThe loss of key employees or personnel could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nThe Company believes that success largely depends on the employment of experienced professionals in a number of key positions. Examples include Phil Hurst, Chief Executive Officer, Evan B. Meyer, Chief Financial Officer, Virginia Lambrix, Winemaker, and Kevin Shaw, an independent contractor who serves as the Creative Director. Any inability or unwillingness of these or other key management team members to continue in their present capacities could harm the business and its reputation.\nA reduction in the Company\u2019s access to or an increase in the cost of the third-party services used to produce its wine could harm its business.\nThe Company utilizes capacity at several third-party facilities for the production of a significant portion of its wines. The inability to use these or alternative facilities, at reasonable prices or at all, could increase the cost or reduce the amount of production, which could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and profits. Certain of these facilities may have been impacted by the Northern California wildfires in October 2017. See Note 14, \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d. The Company does not have long-term agreements with any of these facilities, and they may provide services to competitors at a price above what the Company is willing to pay. The activities conducted at outside facilities include crushing, fermentation, storage, blending, and bottling. The reliance on these third-parties varies according to the type of production activity. As production increases, the Company must increasingly rely upon these third-party production facilities. Reliance on third-parties will also vary with annual harvest volumes.\nIn addition, the Company has limited direct impact over the quality control and quality assurance of these third-party manufacturers. If its suppliers are not able to deliver products that satisfy the Company\u2019s requirements, the Company may be forced to seek alternative providers, which may not be available at the same price, or at all. Moving production to a new third-party service provider could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe terms of the Company\u2019s current bank loans may restrict current and future operations, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to respond to changes in its business and to manage its operations.\nThe Company\u2019s bank loans include a number of customary restrictive covenants that could impair the Company\u2019s financing and operational flexibility and make it difficult to react to market conditions and satisfy ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements. The bank loans contain usual and customary covenants, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nlimitation on incurring senior indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimitation on making loans and advances;\n\u2022\nlimitation on investments, acquisitions and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nlimitation on liens, mergers and sales of assets;\n\u2022\nminimum current assets to current liabilities ratio;\n\u2022\nmaximum debt to effective tangible net worth ratio; and\n\u2022\nminimum quarterly EBITDA.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of its bank loans will depend on future operating performance and, in addition, may be affected by events beyond the Company\u2019s control, and the Company may not meet them. If the Company fails to comply with such covenants and terms, it would be required to obtain waivers from its lenders or agree with the lenders to an amendment of the facility's terms to maintain compliance under such facility. The Company was out of compliance with the debt service coverage ratio covenant on its revolving line of credit for the quarters ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017, but received waivers for those periods from the Company\u2019s lender. If the Company is unable to obtain any necessary waivers and the debt is accelerated, it would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and future operating performance, and the Company may be required to limit activities.\nBecause the Founders retain significant control over Truett-Hurst, Inc. current shareholders and new investors will not have as much influence on corporate decisions as they would if control were less concentrated.\nAs of June 30, 2017, the Founders and current officers and directors of the Company (together, \u201cFounders and Affiliates\u201d) control approximately 41% of the combined voting power of the Company through ownership of outstanding Class A common stock and/or Class B common stock. Prior to conversion of their LLC Units, each holder of LLC Units holds a single share of Class B common stock. Although these shares have no economic rights, they allow the existing owners to exercise voting power over Truett-Hurst, Inc., the managing member of the LLC, at a level that is consistent with their overall equity ownership of the business. As a result, Founders and Affiliates have significant influence in the election of directors and the approval of corporate actions that must be submitted for a vote of shareholders.\nIn addition, certain of the Founders, as well as certain trusts and other entities under their control, have entered into guarantee agreements in connection with its bank loans. For additional information related to bank guaranties, see Part II, Item 8, Note 6, \u201cBorrowings,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe interests of these affiliates may conflict with the interests of other shareholders, and the actions they take or approve may be contrary to those desired by the other shareholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring an acquisition of Truett-Hurst, Inc. by a third-party.\nThe Company has certain transactions with related parties, including Founders, which may present a conflict of interest.\nThe Company routinely sources grapes for its products from vineyards owned by Founders and principal shareholders. The interests of these affiliates in such transactions may be contrary to those desired by shareholders. The policies in place designed to mitigate the risk associated with such transactions; however, shareholders may be harmed by self-dealing with affiliates and loss of corporate opportunity.\nIn addition, from time to time the Company enters into transactions for goods and services with entities in which its executive officers, directors and/or affiliates have interests, as further described under Part II, Item 8, Note 8, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company also enters into grape and bulk wine purchase agreements and bulk wine storage contracts from time to time with entities in which Founders have financial interests. During FY17, the Company entered into such arrangements with:\n\u2022\nPremium Wine Storage, which is owned Paul E. Dolan III (33%) and Heath E. Dolan (33%).\nPaul E. Dolan and Heath E. Dolan each control approximately 5.4% of the combined voting power of the Company. Paul E. Dolan is a director of the Company, while Heath E. Dolan resigned as a director of the Company in May 2017.\nThe Company believes these arrangements reflect substantially the same market terms that would be received in transactions with unaffiliated third-parties. However, if the Company fails to receive market terms for these transactions or other similar transactions in the future, expenses could increase.\nA failure of one or more of the Company\u2019s key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on the business.\nThe Company relies on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, hardware (including laptops and mobile devices), software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in the management of the Company\u2019s business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks, and services include, but are not limited to: hosting the internal network and communication systems; ordering and managing materials from suppliers; supply/demand planning; production; shipping product to customers; hosting the Company\u2019s branded websites and marketing products to consumers; collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor, and other data; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; hosting, processing, and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans, and financial information; complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage the business.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated cyber-crime pose a potential risk to the security of the Company\u2019s IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of its data. If the IT systems, networks, or service providers fail to function properly, or if the Company suffers a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and the Company\u2019s business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely affect business operations and/or financial condition. In addition, such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information, and the Company may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to the Company or to its partners, its employees, customers, suppliers or consumers. In any of these events, the Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and IT systems.\nIf the Company is unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy, and timeliness of its financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d or \u201cGAAP\u201d).\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and as such may elect to avail itself of the certain exemptions from various reporting requirements of public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, an exemption from complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, which is referred to as the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act.\u201d\nThe Company depends upon trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect intellectual property rights or any claims that are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect the competitive position and brand equity.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends significantly on the ability to protect its current and future brands and products, and to defend intellectual property rights. The Company has staked out a reputation for innovation and has introduced new product innovations, including, for example, the evocative \u201cwine wraps\u201d and its proprietary square bottle. The Company has been granted numerous trademark registrations covering its brands and products and has filed, and expects to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products. The Company cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of the trademark applications. There is also a risk that, by the Company\u2019s omission, failure to timely renew or protect a trademark, the trademark could be lost. Additionally, competitors could challenge, invalidate or circumvent existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, the Company.\nA reduction in consumer demand for wines could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThere have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages in the United States and other markets in which the Company participates. A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of the product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including a general decline in economic conditions, increased concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving, a trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, juices and water products, the increased activity of anti-alcohol consumer groups and increased federal, state or foreign excise and other taxes on alcoholic beverage products. The competitive position of the Company\u2019s products could also be affected adversely by any failure to achieve consistent, reliable quality in the product or service levels to customers.\nChanges in consumer spending could have a negative impact on the financial condition and business results.\nWine sales depend upon a number of factors related to the level of consumer spending, including the general state of the economy, federal and state income tax rates, deductibility of business entertainment expenses under federal and state tax laws, and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Changes in consumer spending in these and other areas can affect both the quantity and the price of wines that customers are willing to purchase at restaurants or through retail outlets. Reduced consumer confidence and spending may result in reduced demand for products, limitations on the ability to increase prices and increased levels of selling and promotional expenses. This, in turn, may have a considerable negative impact upon sales and profit margins.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s stock may fluctuate due to seasonal fluctuations in wine sales, operating expenses and net income.\nThe Company experiences seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in sales, operating expenses and net income. The Company has managed, and will continue to manage, the business to achieve long-term objectives. In doing so, the Company may make decisions that it believes will enhance long-term profitability, even if these decisions may reduce\nquarterly earnings. These decisions include the timing of the release of wines for sale, the Company\u2019s wines\u2019 competitive positioning and the grape and bulk wine sources used to produce wines.\nBad weather, drought, plant diseases and other factors could reduce the amount or quality of the grapes available to produce the Company\u2019s wines.\nA shortage in the supply of quality grapes may result from the occurrence of any number of factors which determine the quality and quantity of grape supply, such as weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes, pruning methods, the existence of diseases and pests, and the number of vines producing grapes, as well as the level of consumer demand for wine. Any shortage could cause an increase in the price of some or all of the grape varieties required for wine production and/or a reduction in the amount of wine the Company is able to produce, which could harm the business and reduce sales and profits.\nRecent examples of events affecting supply include the frost in 2008 that significantly impacted the amount of grapes harvested in Mendocino County, the frost of 2011 that had a significant impact on the crop size in Paso Robles and the widespread drought which impacted parts of the United States from 2011 to 2016.\nFactors that reduce the quantity of grapes may also reduce their quality, which in turn could reduce the quality or amount of wine the Company produces. Deterioration in the quality of the wine produced could harm the brand name and a decrease in production could reduce sales and increase expenses.\nAdverse public opinion about alcohol may harm the Company\u2019s business.\nWhile a number of research studies suggest that moderate alcohol consumption may provide various health benefits, other studies conclude or suggest that alcohol consumption has no health benefits and may increase the risk of stroke, cancer and other illnesses. An unfavorable report on the health effects of alcohol consumption could significantly reduce the demand for wine, which could harm the business and reduce sales and increase expenses.\nIn recent years, activist groups have used advertising and other methods to inform the public about the societal harms associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages. These groups have also sought, and continue to seek, legislation to reduce the availability of alcoholic beverages, to increase the penalties associated with the misuse of alcoholic beverages, or to increase the costs associated with the production of alcoholic beverages. Over time, these efforts could cause a reduction in the consumption of alcoholic beverages generally, which could harm the Company\u2019s business and reduce sales and increase expenses.\nContamination of the Company\u2019s wines would harm business.\nBecause the Company\u2019s products are designed for human consumption, the Company\u2019s business is subject to hazards and liabilities related to food products, such as contamination. A discovery of contamination in any of the Company\u2019s wines, through tampering or otherwise, could result in a recall of products. Any recall would significantly damage the Company\u2019s reputation for product quality, which the Company believes is one of its principal competitive assets, and could seriously harm the Company\u2019s business and sales. Although the Company maintains insurance to protect against these risks, the Company may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, and this insurance may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability.\nA decrease in wine score ratings by important rating organizations could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to create greater demand and pricing.\nMany of the Company\u2019s brands are issued ratings or scores by local and national wine rating organizations, and higher scores usually translate into greater demand and higher pricing. Although some of the Company\u2019s brands have been highly rated in the past, and the Company believes its farming and winemaking activities are of a quality to generate good ratings in the future, the Company has no control over ratings issued by third-parties which may not be favorable in the future.\nIncreased regulatory costs or taxes would harm the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe wine industry is regulated extensively by the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau and state and local liquor authorities and State of California environmental agencies. These regulations and laws dictate various matters, including:\n\u2022\nExcise taxes;\n\u2022\nLicensing requirements;\n\u2022\nTrade and pricing practices;\n\u2022\nPermitted distribution channels;\n\u2022\nPermitted and required labeling;\n\u2022\nAdvertising;\n\u2022\nRelationships with distributors and retailers; and\n\u2022\nAir quality, storm water and irrigation use.\nRecent and future zoning ordinances, environmental restrictions and other legal requirements may limit the Company\u2019s plans to expand production capacity, as well as any future development of new vineyards and wineries. In addition, federal legislation has been proposed that could significantly increase excise taxes on wine. Other federal legislation has been proposed which would prevent the Company from selling wine directly through the mail. This proposed legislation, or other new regulations, requirements or taxes, could harm business and operating results. Future legal or regulatory challenges to the wine industry could also harm business and impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nPrompted by growing government budget shortfalls and public reaction against alcohol abuse, Congress and many state legislatures are considering various proposals to impose additional excise taxes on the production and sale of alcoholic beverages, including table wines. Some of the excise tax rates being considered are substantial. The ultimate effects of such legislation, if passed, cannot be assessed accurately since the proposals are still in the discussion stage. Any increase in the taxes imposed on table wines can be expected to have a potentially adverse impact on overall sales of such products. However, the impact may not be proportionate to that experienced by producers of other alcoholic beverages and may not be the same in every state.\nAn increase in the cost of energy or the cost of environmental regulatory compliance could affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company has experienced increases in energy costs, and energy costs could continue to rise, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs. The Company may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses and the cost of capital improvements to the Company\u2019s operating facilities in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements. Future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on the ability to manage the impact of cost increases. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to pass along increased energy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to its customers through increased prices.\nIn addition, the Company may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business or in connection with historical activities of businesses that may be acquired. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants at current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that have been estimated. The Company cannot guarantee that the cost in relation to these matters will not exceed\nprojections or otherwise have an adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect the Company\u2019s business, operations or financial performance, and water scarcity or poor water quality could negatively impact production costs and capacity.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources. There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Severe weather events and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which the Company presently sources agricultural raw materials such as grapes. Decreased availability of raw materials may increase the cost of goods for the Company\u2019s products. Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt the supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.\nWater is essential in the production of the Company\u2019s products. The quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of grapes and the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality that may affect production costs or impose capacity constraints. Such events could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition.\nNatural disasters, including earthquakes or fires, could destroy the Company\u2019s facilities or the Company\u2019s inventory, and/or negatively impact contracted third-party production and storage capacity and availability.\nThe Company must store its wine in a limited number of locations for a period of time prior to its sale or distribution. Any intervening catastrophes, such as an earthquake or fire, that result in the destruction of all or a portion of its wine would result in a loss of investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from, that wine. Such a loss would seriously harm business and reduce sales and profits. See Note 14, \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d.\nFrom time to time the Company may become subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Uninsured judgments or a rise in insurance premiums may adversely impact business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may become subject to legal and regulatory proceedings. Any claims raised in such proceedings, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. Additionally, the outcome of such proceedings may differ from expectations because outcomes are often difficult to predict reliably. Various factors can lead to changes in estimates of liabilities and other costs and may require the Company to make new or additional estimates. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in any particular period.\nIn accordance with customary practice, the Company maintains insurance against some, but not all, potential claims. In the future, the Company may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. In addition, the levels of insurance the Company maintains may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant judgment or claim is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Organizational Structure\nTruett-Hurst, Inc.\u2019s only material asset is its interest in the LLC, and it is accordingly dependent upon distributions from the LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the tax receivable agreement or pay dividends.\nThe Company is a holding company and has no material assets other than its controlling member equity interest in the LLC. It has no independent means of generating revenue. The Company will cause the LLC to make distributions to its unit holders in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes at assumed tax rates, payments\nunder the tax receivable agreement (which the Company expects to be substantial) and dividends, if any, declared by the Company. To the extent that the Company needs funds, and the LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of its financing arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of the Company.\nThe Founders have significant influence on Truett-Hurst, Inc. and their interests may differ from those of the public shareholders.\nAs of June 30, 2017, the Founders and Affiliates control 41% of the combined voting power through their ownership of the outstanding Class A common stock and/or Class B common stock. Because the Founders and Affiliates hold a majority of their ownership interest in the business through the LLC (approximately 94% of their ownership), rather than through the public company, the Founders and Affiliates may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of the Class A common stock. For example, the Founders and Affiliates may have different tax positions from the Company which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the tax receivable agreement that the Company entered in to, and whether and when the Company should terminate the tax receivable agreement and accelerate the obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration the Founders\u2019 and Affiliates\u2019 tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to the Company. The tax receivable agreement also provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, or other forms of business combinations, substantial payment obligations to the Founders and Affiliates will accelerate.\nThe Company will be required to pay the counterparties to the tax receivable agreement for certain tax benefits the Company may claim arising in connection with current exchanges, future purchases or exchanges of LLC Units and related transactions, and the amounts the Company may pay could be significant.\nThe Company entered into a tax receivable agreement with the pre-IPO owners that provides for the payment by Truett-Hurst, Inc. to these parties of 90% of the benefits, if any, that Truett-Hurst, Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of the increases in tax basis resulting from its purchases or exchanges of LLC Units and certain other tax benefits related to it entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nThe Company expects the payments that it may make under the tax receivable agreement will be substantial. There may be a material negative effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, the payments under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual benefits realized in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement and/or distributions to Truett-Hurst, Inc. by the LLC, or if LLC funds are not sufficient to permit Truett-Hurst, Inc. to make payments under the tax receivable agreement after it has paid taxes. The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon the continued ownership of the Company by the counterparties to the tax receivable agreement. The tax receivable agreement also provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, or other forms of business combinations, substantial payment obligations to the Founders and Affiliates will accelerate.\nThe Company is required to make a good faith effort to ensure that it has sufficient cash available to make any required payments under the tax receivable agreement. The operating agreement of the LLC requires the LLC to make \u201ctax distributions\u201d which, in the ordinary course, will be sufficient to pay the actual tax liability and to fund required payments under the tax receivable agreement. If for any reason the LLC is not able to make a tax distribution in an amount that is sufficient to make any required payment under the tax receivable agreement or the Company otherwise lacks sufficient funds, interest would accrue on any unpaid amounts at LIBOR plus 500 basis points until they are paid. If the Company breaches any of its material obligations under the tax receivable agreement, substantial payment obligations will generally be accelerated and due as if the Company had exercised its right to terminate the agreement\nIn the event that the Company and an exchanging LLC Unit holder are unable to resolve a disagreement with respect to the tax receivable agreement, the Company is required to appoint either an expert in the relevant field or an arbitrator to make a determination, depending on the matter in dispute.\nIn certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreement to the existing owners may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits realized in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement.\nThe tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control, or if, at any time, Truett-Hurst, Inc. elects an early termination of the tax receivable agreement, Truett-Hurst, Inc.\u2019s (or its successor's) obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired LLC Units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction) would be based on certain assumptions, including that the corporate taxpayer would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement. As a result, (i) the Company could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are greater than or less than the specified percentage of the actual benefits realized in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement and (ii) if the Company elects to terminate the tax receivable agreement early, the Company would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits, and this upfront payment may be made years in advance of the actual realization of such future benefits. Upon a subsequent actual exchange, any additional increase in tax deductions, tax basis and other benefits in excess of the amounts assumed at the change in control will also result in payments under the tax receivable agreement. In these situations, the Company\u2019s obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on its liquidity. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to finance its obligations under the tax receivable agreement.\nPayments under the tax receivable agreement are based on the tax reporting positions that the Company determines. Although the Company is not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge a tax basis increase, Truett-Hurst, Inc. will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the tax receivable agreement in excess of the benefits that Truett-Hurst, Inc. actually realizes in respect of (i) the increases in tax basis resulting from exchanges of LLC Units and (ii) certain other tax benefits related to entering in to the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a delisting of the Class A common stock.\nIf the Company fails to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the requirement that it maintain a share price of at least $1.00 per share, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list the Class A common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of the Class A common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase the Company\u2019s Class A common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, the Company would expect to seek to take actions to restore compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but the Company can provide no assurance that any such action taken would allow the Class A common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of the Class A common stock or prevent the Class A common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement in the future.\nThe Company does not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe Company does not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Payments of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including the business, operating results and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of the Class A common stock, if any, may be the only source of gain on an investment in the Class A common stock.\nEven if the Company decides in the future to pay any dividends, Truett-Hurst, Inc. is a holding company with no independent operations of its own except its controlling member equity interest in the LLC. As a result, Truett-Hurst, Inc. depends on LLC and its affiliates for cash to pay its obligations and make dividend payments. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of LLC and its affiliates for any reason could limit or impair its ability to pay cash distributions or other distributions to us. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends in the future is dependent upon receipt of cash from LLC and its affiliates. LLC and its affiliates may be restricted from sending cash to the Company by, among other things, law or provisions of the documents governing the Company\u2019s existing or future indebtedness.\nIf securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or reports about the Company\u2019s business, or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, the stock price and trading volume could decline further.\nAs a small-cap company, our common stock has limited liquidity. The market price and trading volume of shares of the common stock are volatile and are likely to continue to fluctuate substantially in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to operating performance. The trading market for the Company\u2019s Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about the Company or its business. The Company has limited research coverage for its stock and it is difficult to attract research coverage for small-cap companies like ours. If any of the analysts who cover the Company downgrades the Company\u2019s Class A common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about the Company\u2019s business, its Class A common stock price may decline further. If analysts cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on the Company, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the Class A common stock price or trading volume to decline further and the Class A common stock to be less liquid.\nThe market price and trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock are volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nAs a small-cap company, our common stock has limited liquidity. The market price and trading volume of shares of the common stock are volatile and are likely to continue to fluctuate substantially in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to operating performance. These fluctuations could cause investors to lose part or all of their investment in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, operating results could be below the expectations of the public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in quarterly operating results, departures of key management personnel, failure to meet analysts' earnings estimates, publication of research reports about the industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting the Company\u2019s business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness the Company may incur or securities the Company may issue in the future, and other factors. You may be unable to resell your shares of Class A common stock at or above the price you originally paid. In addition, as a result of the Company\u2019s market capitalization, among other factors, there is limited liquidity in the market for the Company\u2019s common stock. As a result, even if you choose to sell your shares of Class A common stock, you may find it difficult to do so.\nIn past years, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against the Company, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of its management's attention and resources.\nYou may be diluted by the future issuance of additional Class A common stock in connection with the Company\u2019s incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise.\nAs of June 30, 2017, the Company had an aggregate of 10.6 million shares of Class A common stock authorized but unissued, including approximately 2.76 million shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exchange of outstanding LLC Units and 0.1 million shares reserved for issuance under its 2012 Incentive Plan. See Part II, Item 8, Note 10, \u201cStock-based Compensation\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The certificate of incorporation authorizes the Company to issue these shares of Class A common stock and restricted stock rights relating to Class A common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by the board of directors in its sole discretion. Any Class A common stock that is issued, including under the 2012 Incentive Plan or other equity incentive plans that the Company may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by then existing holders of Class A common stock.\nThe Company incurs increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations that affect public companies, which could materially adversely affect results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nAs a public company, the Company incurs significant legal, accounting and other expenses that it did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements. These requirements include compliance with Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ. In addition, the management team will also have to adapt to the requirements of being a public company. The Company expects compliance with these rules and regulations will substantially increase its legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe increased costs associated with operating as a public company will decrease the Company\u2019s net income or increase its net loss, and may require the Company to reduce costs in other areas of its business or increase the prices of its products or services. Additionally, if these requirements divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nHowever, for as long as the Company remains an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, the Company may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the Company\u2019s periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. The Company may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until it is no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nThe Company will not be required to comply with certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for as long as it remains an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nFor as long as the Company remains an emerging growth company, it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. The Company may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until it is no longer an emerging growth company. The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the beginning of FY19 unless it no longer qualifies for such status prior to that time. After the Company is no longer an emerging growth company, it expects to incur additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nReduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d the Company takes advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. The Company cannot predict if investors will find its common stock less attractive as it relies on these exemptions. If some investors find the common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock and its stock price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 13970, "SIC": 2084, "TIC": "THST"}
