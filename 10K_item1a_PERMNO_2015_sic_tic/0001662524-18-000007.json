{"cik": "1662524", "company": "AKCEA THERAPEUTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have a limited operating history and may never become profitable.\nIonis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, incorporated us as a Delaware corporation in December 2014, and we have operated as an affiliate of Ionis since that time. As such, we have limited experience as a company, and no experience operating independently from Ionis, and have not yet demonstrated that we can successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly the biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields.\nAs a company, we have never obtained regulatory approval for, or commercialized, any product. Our ability to generate substantial revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with strategic partners, to successfully develop our drugs, and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development. If volanesorsen is approved, we anticipate receiving our first revenue from product sales in 2018. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales depends heavily on our and our current and future strategic partners' success in:\n\u25cf\ncompleting clinical development of volanesorsen for additional indications and nonclinical and clinical development of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx;\n\u25cf\nseeking and obtaining regulatory and marketing authorization for our drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development;\n\u25cf\nestablishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide the amount and quality of products and services we need to continue to develop and, if approved, commercialize volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development;\n\u25cf\nlaunching and commercializing volanesorsen and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx by establishing a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u25cf\nlaunching and co-commercializing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx through our collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, under terms that we plan to negotiate with Novartis in the future;\n\u25cf\neducating physicians about our target patient populations, including patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, and patients with familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL;\n\u25cf\nobtaining market acceptance of volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development as viable treatment options;\n\u25cf\nobtaining and maintaining adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development;\n\u25cf\naddressing any competing technological and market developments;\n\u25cf\nimplementing additional internal systems and infrastructure, as needed, to ultimately operate without reliance on Ionis;\n\u25cf\nnegotiating favorable terms in any partnership, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;\n\u25cf\nmaintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, product trademarks and know-how;\n\u25cf\ndeveloping and commercializing volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development without infringing others' intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf\nattracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nWe may not successfully develop any products, generate product revenue or achieve profitability. If we cannot achieve or maintain profitability, it would depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. If the market price of our common stock declined, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception.\nBecause drug discovery and development require substantial lead-time and funding prior to commercialization, we have incurred expenses while generating limited revenue from our operating activities since our formation. Our net losses were $109.8 million, $83.2 million and $61.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $284.4 million. Most of the losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses may increase if we cannot generate substantial revenue.\nWe will require substantial additional funding to achieve our goals. If we fail to obtain timely funding, we may need to curtail or abandon some of our programs.\nAll of our drugs are undergoing clinical studies. All of our drug programs will require additional nonclinical and/or clinical testing and/or marketing authorization prior to commercialization. We will need to spend significant additional resources to conduct these activities. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or other regulatory authorities require us to perform clinical studies and other studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments equal to $260.1 million. Our operating expenses were $163.9 million, $83.5 million and $61.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nPrior to our IPO, we funded our operating activities through a $100.0 million cash contribution we received from Ionis in 2015, $75.0 million we received from initiating our collaboration with Novartis and $106.0 million in drawdowns under our line of credit with Ionis. The line of credit converted to our common stock when we closed our IPO. We no longer have access to the line of credit following the closing of our IPO and we do not have any firm commitment from Ionis to fund our cash flow deficits or provide other direct or indirect financial assistance to us. Additionally, in July 2017 we received $182.3 million in net proceeds from our IPO including $25.0 million Ionis invested in our IPO and the Novartis concurrent private placement of $50 million. Based on our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the proceeds from our IPO and the concurrent private placement with Novartis, we will need to raise additional funding to continue developing the drugs in our pipeline and to seek regulatory approval for and to commercialize volanesorsen and other drugs in our pipeline.\nEven if we obtain marketing authorizations to sell volanesorsen or AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, we will incur significant costs to commercialize the approved product. Even if we generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, we may not become profitable and would need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development, Regulatory Review and Approval of Our Drugs\nIf the results of clinical testing indicate that any of our drugs are not suitable for commercial use, we may need to abandon one or more of our drug development programs.\nDrug discovery and development has inherent risks and the historical failure rate for drugs is high. Antisense drugs are a relatively new approach to therapeutics. If we cannot demonstrate that our drugs are safe and effective for human use in the intended indication, we may need to abandon one or more of our drug development programs.\nIf any of our drugs in clinical studies, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, do not show sufficient safety and efficacy in patients with the targeted indication, it would negatively affect our development and commercialization goals for the drug and we would have expended significant resources with little or no benefit to us.\nEven if our drugs are successful in preclinical and earlier-stage clinical studies, the drugs may not be successful in later-stage clinical studies.\nSuccessful results in preclinical or initial clinical studies, including the results of earlier studies for our drugs in development, may not predict the results of subsequent clinical studies, including the Phase 3 study of volanesorsen for the treatment of FPL. There are a number of factors that could cause a clinical study to fail or be delayed, including:\n\u25cf\nthe clinical study may produce negative or inconclusive results;\n\u25cf\nregulators may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nwe, our partners, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could suspend or terminate a clinical study due to adverse side effects of a drug on people in the study;\n\u25cf\nwe or our partners may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nwe or our partners may not identify, recruit and train suitable clinical investigators at a sufficient number of study sites;\n\u25cf\nthe institutional review board for a prospective site might withhold or delay its approval for the study;\n\u25cf\nenrollment in our clinical studies may be slower than we anticipate;\n\u25cf\npatients who enroll in the clinical study may later drop out due to adverse events, a perception they are not benefiting from participating in the study, fatigue with the clinical study process or personal issues;\n\u25cf\na clinical study site may deviate from the protocol for the study;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of our clinical studies may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u25cf\nwe or our partners may require additional capital to fund the clinical study; and\n\u25cf\nthe supply or quality of our drugs or other materials necessary to conduct the clinical studies may be insufficient, inadequate or delayed.\nIn addition, volanesorsen and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx have the same mechanism of action, and all of our current drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, are chemically similar to each other and the drugs Ionis and other companies are developing separately. As a result, a safety observation we, Ionis or other companies encounter with one of our or their drugs could have or be perceived by a regulatory authority to have an impact on a different drug we are developing. This could cause the FDA and other regulators to ask questions or take actions that could harm or delay our ability to develop and commercialize our drugs or increase our costs. For example, the FDA or other regulatory agencies could request, among other things, any of the following regarding one of our drugs: additional information or commitments before we can start or continue a clinical study, protocol amendments, increased safety monitoring, additional product labeling information, and post-approval commitments. Similarly, we have an ongoing Phase 3 study of volanesorsen in patients with FPL, an ongoing open label extension study of volanesorsen in patients with FCS, and an early access program, or EAP, for volanesorsen. Adverse events or results from these studies or the EAP could negatively impact our planned marketing approval applications for volanesorsen in patients with FCS or the commercial opportunity for volanesorsen.\nAny failure or delay in the clinical studies for any of our drugs in development could reduce the commercial potential or viability of our drugs.\nWe may not have appropriately designed the planned and ongoing clinical studies for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development to support submission of a marketing application to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities or demonstrate safety or efficacy at the level required by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities for product approval.\nWe recently completed a Phase 3 clinical program for volanesorsen for the treatment of FCS and have an ongoing Phase 3 study of volanesorsen in patients with FPL. We are also conducting or plan to conduct additional clinical studies for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx.\nEven if we achieve positive results on the endpoints for these clinical studies or any future clinical studies, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may believe the clinical studies do not show the appropriate balance of safety and efficacy in the indication being sought or may interpret the data differently than we do, and deem the results insufficient to demonstrate the appropriate balance of safety and efficacy at the level required for product approval. For example, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could claim that we have not tested volanesorsen in a sufficient number of patients to demonstrate volanesorsen is safe and effective in patients with FCS or FPL to support an application for marketing authorization. In such a case, we may need to conduct additional clinical studies before obtaining marketing authorization, which would be expensive and delay these development programs. These risks are more likely to occur since we are developing our drugs against therapeutic targets or to treat diseases in which there is little or no clinical experience. In addition, these risks may be more likely to occur for volanesorsen since there were some patients in the Phase 3 program that experienced serious platelet events (grade 4 thrombocytopenia), a condition in which the patient has very low platelet levels, and additional patients experienced other adverse events in the program, including patients who discontinued participation in the APPROACH study due to platelet count declines. We believe that the enhanced monitoring we have implemented to support early detection and management of these issues can help manage these safety issues so that patients can continue treatment. Since implementation of the enhanced monitoring, serious platelet events have been infrequent.\nWe may make modifications to the clinical study protocols or designs of our ongoing clinical studies that delay enrollment or completion of such clinical studies and could delay regulatory approval of volanesorsen and our other drugs in development. Any failure to obtain approval for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development on the timeline that we currently anticipate, or at all, would have a material and adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf we or our partners fail to obtain regulatory approval for our drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, we or our partners cannot sell them in the applicable markets.\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, will be safe and effective, or will be approved for commercialization. We and our partners must conduct time-consuming, extensive and costly clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of each of our drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, before they can be approved for sale. We and our partners must conduct these studies in compliance with FDA regulations and with comparable regulations in other countries.\nWe or our partners may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our drugs. It is possible that regulatory authorities will not approve any of our drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, for marketing. If the FDA or another regulatory authority believes that we or our partners have not sufficiently demonstrated the safety or efficacy of any of our drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, the authority will not approve the specific drug or will require additional studies, which can be time consuming and expensive and which will delay or harm our ability to successfully commercialize the drug. For example, since some patients in the Phase 3 program for volanesorsen experienced serious platelet events (grade 4 thrombocytopenia), a condition in which the patient has very low platelet levels, and additional patients experienced other adverse events in the program, some of whom discontinued participation in the studies, including patients who discontinued participation in the APPROACH study due to platelet count declines, the FDA or another regulatory authority may require us to conduct additional studies of volanesorsen before considering an application for marketing approval. We believe that the enhanced monitoring we have implemented to support early detection and management of these issues can help manage these safety issues so that patients can continue treatment. Since implementation of the enhanced monitoring, serious platelet events have been infrequent.\nThe FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nwe or our partners may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that a drug is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may not accept clinical data from studies conducted at clinical facilities that have deficient clinical practices or that are in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States;\n\u25cf\nwe or our partners may be unable to demonstrate that our drug's clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks to support approval;\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may disagree with the interpretation of data from preclinical or clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers who manufacture clinical and commercial supplies for our drugs; and\n\u25cf\nthe approval policies or regulations of such authorities or their prior guidance to us or our partners during clinical development may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nFailure to successfully develop volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, or to receive marketing authorization for these drugs or delays in these authorizations would prevent or delay the commercial launch of the drug, and, as a result, would negatively affect our ability to generate revenue.\nThe FDA's Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products advisory committee will discuss and advise FDA on the risk-benefit profile of volanesorsen for the treatment of FCS tentatively scheduled for May 10, 2018. In advance of this advisory committee meeting, we and the FDA will submit briefing documents for the committee's review, and these briefing documents will be made available to the public and may include information from the volanesorsen development program that have not previously been disclosed. Historically, for some companies, disclosure of information in this manner has led to increased volatility in their stock price. The advisory committee and FDA may interpret nonclinical and clinical data differently than we and our experts have. Press coverage and public scrutiny of the materials that will be discussed at the advisory committee meeting may negatively affect the potential for our volanesorsen NDA to receive approval or the trading price of our securities. Even if we ultimately obtain approval of the volanesorsen NDA, the matters discussed at the advisory committee meeting could limit our ability to successfully commercialize volanesorsen.\nWe may not be able to benefit from orphan drug designation for volanesorsen, or any of our other drugs.\nThe FDA and EMA have granted orphan drug designation to volanesorsen for the treatment of patients with FCS. The EMA has granted orphan drug designation to volanesorsen for the treatment of patients with FPL and we are in the process of applying for orphan drug status for FPL in the United States. In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process, but it can provide financial incentives, such as tax advantages and user-fee waivers, as well as longer regulatory exclusivity periods.\nWe may lose orphan drug exclusivity if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we cannot assure sufficient quantity of the applicable drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nEven if we maintain orphan drug exclusivity for volanesorsen or obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our other drugs, the exclusivity may not effectively protect the drug from competition because regulatory authorities still may authorize different drugs for the same condition.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular drug or indication and fail to capitalize on drugs or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe are dedicating a substantial amount of our resources to develop and seek regulatory approval for volanesorsen to treat patients with FCS and FPL. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with our other drugs or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial drugs or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and drugs for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable drugs.\nOur drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, could be subject to regulatory limitations following approval.\nFollowing approval of a drug, we and our partners must comply with comprehensive government regulations regarding the manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products. Promotional communications regarding prescription drugs must be consistent with the information in the product's approved labeling. We and our partners may not obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable to successfully commercialize our drug products, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory authorities can impose significant restrictions on an approved drug product through the product label and on advertising, promotional and distribution activities.\nIn addition, when approved, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority may condition approval on the performance of post-approval clinical studies or patient monitoring, which could be time consuming and expensive. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us or our partners that may be expensive and/or time consuming to fulfill.\nIn addition, if we or others identify side effects after any of our drug products are on the market, if manufacturing problems occur subsequent to regulatory approval, or if we, our manufacturers or our partners fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we or our partners could be subject to:\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on our ability to conduct clinical studies, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or planned clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on such products' manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf\nchanges to the product label;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the marketing of a product;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on product distribution;\n\u25cf\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nUntitled or Warning Letters;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u25cf\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u25cf\nrecall of products;\n\u25cf\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u25cf\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u25cf\nproduct seizure;\n\u25cf\ninjunctions; or\n\u25cf\nimposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nAny one or a combination of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected drug product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing such drug product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating any revenue or profit from the sale of the drug product.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Drugs\nIf we cannot establish effective marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our drug products, we may not generate product revenue.\nWe currently have a limited commercial infrastructure to market, sell or distribute our drugs. If approved, to commercialize our products, we must build our marketing, sales and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We may not be successful in doing so. To commercialize volanesorsen and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in the initial indications we plan to pursue, we plan to build a specialty sales force in each global region we expect to market the applicable drug, supported by case managers, reimbursement specialists, partnerships with specialty pharmacies, injection training, routine platelet monitoring, dietary counseling and a medical affairs team. We may seek to further penetrate markets by expanding our sales force or through strategic partnerships with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies or third-party sales organizations, such as our strategic collaboration with Novartis.\nEven though certain members of our management team and other employees have significant experience commercializing drug products, as a company we have no prior experience marketing, selling or distributing drug products, and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a commercial infrastructure. It will be expensive and time consuming for us to build and establish our own sales force and related compliance protocols to market any drug products. We may never successfully develop this capability and any failure could delay or preclude a product launch. We and our partners, will have to compete with other companies to recruit, hire, train, manage and retain marketing and sales personnel.\nWe will incur expenses prior to product launch to develop a marketing and sales infrastructure. If regulatory requirements or other factors cause a delay in the commercial launch of volanesorsen, or our other drugs in development, we would incur additional expenses for having developed these capabilities earlier than required and prior to realizing any revenue from sales of volanesorsen and our other drugs in development. Even if we can effectively hire a sales force and develop a marketing and sales infrastructure, our sales force and marketing teams may not successfully commercialize volanesorsen or our other drugs in development.\nIf we cannot hire a sales force or collaborate with a third-party marketing and sales organization to globally commercialize any approved drug product, our ability to generate product revenue may be limited. To the extent we rely on third parties to commercialize any drug products, such as would be the case if Novartis exercises its option for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, we may receive less revenue than if we commercialized these drug products ourselves. In addition, we would have less control over the sales efforts of any other third parties involved in our commercialization efforts.\nWe plan to rely on third-party specialty channels to distribute volanesorsen, and our other drugs to patients. If we cannot effectively establish and manage this distribution process, it could harm or delay the commercial launch and sales of volanesorsen and our other drugs in development.\nWe and our strategic partners may contract with, and rely on, third-party specialty pharmacies to distribute volanesorsen, and our other drugs to patients. A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in dispensing medications for complex or chronic conditions, a process that requires a high level of patient education and ongoing management. Our management team will need to devote a significant amount of its attention to building and managing this distribution network. If we cannot effectively build and manage this distribution process, the commercial launch and sales of volanesorsen and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx will be delayed or less successful, which would harm our results of operations.\nIn addition, the use of specialty pharmacies involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will:\n\u25cf\nnot provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using our drugs or complaints regarding our drugs;\n\u25cf\nnot effectively sell or support volanesorsen, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and our other drugs;\n\u25cf\nreduce or discontinue their efforts to sell or support volanesorsen, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx or our other drugs;\n\u25cf\nnot devote the resources necessary to sell volanesorsen, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx or our other drugs in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n\u25cf\nnot satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or\n\u25cf\ncease operations.\nAny such events may result in decreased sales and lower revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the market does not accept our drugs, including volanesorsen and our other drugs in development, we are not likely to generate substantial product revenue or become profitable.\nEven if we or our strategic partners obtain a marketing authorization for volanesorsen and our other drugs in development, our success will depend upon the medical community, patients and third-party payors accepting our drugs as medically useful, cost-effective, safe and convenient. Even if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities authorize our drugs for commercialization, doctors may not prescribe our drugs to treat patients. We and our partners may not successfully commercialize additional drugs.\nAdditionally, in many of the markets where we or our partners may sell our drugs in the future, if we cannot agree with the government or other third-party payors regarding the price we can charge for our drugs, then we may not be able to sell our drugs in that market. Similarly, cost control initiatives by governments or third-party payors could decrease the price received for our drugs or increase patient coinsurance to a level that makes commercializing volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development economically unviable.\nThe degree of market acceptance for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development depends upon a number of factors, including the:\n\u25cf\nreceipt and scope of marketing authorizations;\n\u25cf\nestablishment and demonstration in the medical and patient community of the efficacy and safety of our drugs and their potential advantages over competing products;\n\u25cf\ncost and effectiveness of our drugs compared to other available therapies;\n\u25cf\npatient convenience of the dosing regimen for our drugs; and\n\u25cf\nreimbursement by government and third-party payors.\nBased on the profile of our drugs, physicians, patients, patient advocates, payors or the medical community in general may not accept and/or use any drugs that we may develop. For example, in the clinical studies with volanesorsen, declines in platelet counts were observed in many patients and some patients discontinued the study because of platelet declines. Therefore, we expect volanesorsen's product label will require periodic platelet monitoring, which could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain patients for volanesorsen. We believe that the enhanced monitoring we have implemented to support early detection and management of these issues can help manage these safety issues so that patients can continue treatment. Since implementation of the enhanced monitoring, serious platelet events have been infrequent. While we believe we can better maintain patients on volanesorsen through our patient-centric commercial approach where we plan to have greater involvement with physicians and patients, if we cannot effectively maintain patients on volanesorsen, we may not be able to generate substantial revenue from volanesorsen sales.\nThe patient populations suffering from FCS and FPL are small and have not been established with precision. If the actual number of patients is smaller than we estimate, or if we cannot raise awareness of these diseases and diagnosis is not improved, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe estimate there are 3,000 to 5,000 FCS patients and an additional 3,000 to 5,000 FPL patients globally. Our estimates of the sizes of the patient populations are based on published studies as well as internal analyses. If the results of these studies or our analyses of them do not accurately reflect the number of patients with FCS and FPL, our assessment of the market potential for volanesorsen may be inaccurate, making it difficult or impossible for us to meet our revenue goals, or to obtain and maintain profitability. In addition, as is the case with most orphan diseases, if we cannot successfully raise awareness of these diseases and improve diagnosis, it will be more difficult or impossible to achieve profitability.\nIn addition, since the patient populations for FCS and FPL are small, the per-patient drug pricing must be high in order to recover our development and manufacturing costs, fund adequate patient support programs and achieve profitability. For these initial indications, we may not maintain or obtain sufficient sales volume at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts and our sales and marketing and manufacturing expenses.\nIf we or our partners fail to compete effectively, volanesorsen and our other drugs in development will not contribute significant revenue.\nOur competitors engage in drug discovery throughout the world, are numerous and include, among others, major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biopharmaceutical firms. Our competitors may succeed in developing drugs that are:\n\u25cf\nsafer than our drugs;\n\u25cf\nmore effective than our drugs;\n\u25cf\npriced lower than our drugs;\n\u25cf\nreimbursed more favorably by government and other third-party payors than our drugs; or\n\u25cf\nmore convenient to use than our drugs.\nThese competitive developments could make our drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, obsolete or non-competitive. Further, all of our drugs are delivered by injection, which may render them less attractive to patients than non-injectable products offered by our current or future competitors.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical testing and human clinical studies, in obtaining FDA and other regulatory authorizations and in commercializing pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory authorization for products earlier than we do. Marketing and sales capability is another factor relevant to the competitive position of our drugs, and many of our competitors will have greater marketing and sales capabilities than our capabilities.\nThere are several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in the development or commercialization of products against targets that are also targets of drugs in our development pipeline. For example, if approved, volanesorsen could face competition from drugs like metreleptin. Metreleptin, produced by Novelion Therapeutics, Inc., is currently approved for use in generalized lipodystrophy patients. In September 2016, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Amgen Inc. announced a license and collaboration for development of Arrowhead's preclinical program which uses an RNAi conjugated with a GalNAc for the same target as AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx may compete with gemcabene, an oral small molecule that reduces apoC-III, that Gemphire Therapeutics, Inc. is developing to treat patients with triglycerides above 500 mg/dL. If volanesorsen or the other drugs in our pipeline cannot compete effectively with these and other products with common or similar indications to the drugs in our pipeline, we may not be able to generate substantial revenue from our product sales.\nIf government or other third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and payment rates for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, our revenue and prospects for profitability will be limited.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our future products will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. The majority of patients in the United States who would fit within our target patient populations for our drugs have their healthcare supported by a combination of Medicare coverage, other government health programs such as Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be enough to make our drugs affordable. Accordingly, volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, if approved, will face competition from other therapies and drugs for limited financial resources. We may need to conduct post-marketing studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to satisfy third-party payors. These studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Third-party payors may never consider our future products as cost-effective. Adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. For example, in the United States, recent health reform measures have resulted in reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products and bring more transparency to drug pricing. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products or drugs may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, which would negatively affect the potential commercial success of our products, our revenue and our profits.\nIf we are found in violation of federal or state \"fraud and abuse\" laws or other healthcare laws and regulations, we may be required to pay a penalty and/or be suspended from participation in federal or state healthcare programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare \"fraud and abuse,\" including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws, among other things, make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to pay, or offer to pay, a healthcare provider to refer, purchase or prescribe a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory and regulatory provisions, it is possible that government authorities and others might challenge our practices under anti-kickback or other fraud and abuse laws. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. In addition, false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to government third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid claims for reimbursed drugs that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. If we violated fraud and abuse laws, we could face a combination of:\n\u25cf\ncriminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and\n\u25cf\ncorporate integrity agreements, which could impose rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on us.\nGiven the significant penalties and fines that the government can impose on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government were to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals may bring similar actions under the False Claims Act. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing focus on these laws by law enforcement authorities. To the extent we have access to protected health information we could be subject to federal and state health information privacy and security laws, including without limitation, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information. State health information privacy and security laws in certain circumstances are more stringent than HIPAA and many of the state laws differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance. Our failure to comply with applicable federal and state health information privacy and security laws could subject us to significant fines and multi-year corrective action plans. Once we have a commercialized drug, we will be required to report annually to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services certain information related to payments and other transfers of value we may provide to physicians and teaching hospitals. Further, an increasing number of state laws require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws are unclear as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state authorities.\nSimilar rigid restrictions related to anti-kickbacks and promoting and marketing medicinal products apply in the European Union and other countries. Authorities in these countries strictly enforce these restrictions. Even in those countries where we will not be directly responsible for promoting and marketing our products, inappropriate activity by any of our international commercialization partners we may have could harm us.\nRisks Related to Dependence on Third Parties\nWe plan to substantially depend on our collaboration with Novartis to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx.\nWe have granted Novartis an exclusive option to exclusively license each of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx pursuant to our strategic collaboration, option and license agreement with Novartis. We plan to substantially depend on Novartis to further develop and commercialize these drugs. We initiated this collaboration primarily to have Novartis:\n\u25cf\nconduct the cardiovascular outcome studies that are likely to be required for approval of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx;\n\u25cf\nseek and obtain regulatory approvals for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx; and\n\u25cf\nglobally commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx.\nIf Novartis exercises its option to license one or both of these drugs, we would rely on Novartis to further develop, obtain regulatory approvals for, and commercialize the licensed drug. In general, we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that Novartis devotes to our strategic collaboration. If Novartis fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to further develop, obtain regulatory approvals for, or commercialize these drugs, or if Novartis' efforts are not effective, our business may be negatively affected. Novartis could pursue other technologies or develop other drugs either on its own or in collaboration with others to treat the same diseases as we and Novartis plan to treat with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. Novartis could pursue these technologies and develop these other drugs at the same time as it is developing or commercializing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, and Novartis is not required to inform us of such activities.\nOur strategic collaboration with Novartis may not continue for various reasons. Novartis can terminate our agreement at any time and is under no obligation to exercise the options we granted them. If Novartis does not exercise its option, or following option exercise stops developing or commercializing a drug, we will have to seek additional sources for funding and may have to delay or reduce our development and commercialization plans for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx.\nIn addition, if Novartis exercises its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, Novartis would be responsible for the long-term supply of drug substance and finished drug product for the licensed drug.\nOur strategic collaboration with Novartis may not result in the successful commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. If Novartis does not successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, we may receive limited or no revenues for these drugs.\nAKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx may compete with volanesorsen, which could reduce our expected revenues for volanesorsen.\nVolanesorsen and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx both inhibit the production of the same protein. We believe the enhancements we incorporated into AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx can provide greater patient convenience by allowing for significantly lower doses and less frequent administration compared to volanesorsen. As such, if Novartis exercises its option and successfully commercializes AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx while we are commercializing volanesorsen, to the extent physicians and patients elect to use AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx instead of volanesorsen, it will reduce the revenue we derive from volanesorsen. In addition, while AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and volanesorsen use different mechanisms of action, if AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx can effectively lower triglyceride levels in FCS patients, it may likewise reduce the revenue we derive from volanesorsen.\nIf we cannot manufacture our drugs or contract with a third party to manufacture our drugs at costs that allow us to charge competitive prices to buyers, we will not be able to operate profitably.\nTo successfully commercialize volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, we will need to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities either on our own or through a third-party manufacturer. In addition, as our drug development pipeline matures, we will have a greater need for clinical study and commercial manufacturing capacity. We have no direct experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products of the chemical class represented by our drugs, called oligonucleotides, on a commercial scale for the systemic administration of a drug. We currently rely and expect to rely for the foreseeable future on Ionis' manufacturing capacity and efficiency to produce our oligonucleotide drugs, and our business could be negatively affected if Ionis ceased to provide us with this capability for any reason. In addition, there are a small number of suppliers for certain raw materials that we use to manufacture our drugs, and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing. Further, if we cannot continue to acquire raw materials from these suppliers on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may be required to find alternative suppliers, which could be expensive and time consuming and negatively affect our ability to develop or commercialize our drugs in a timely manner or at all. We may not be able to manufacture our drugs at a cost or in quantities necessary to make commercially successful products.\nWe do not have long-term supply agreements for our drugs. We cannot guarantee that we will have a steady supply of drug to complete clinical studies, make registration batches for approval or satisfy market demand if commercialized at prices that are commercially acceptable. In addition, if we need to change manufacturers for any reason, we will need to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with verifying a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop drugs in a timely manner or within budget.\nAlso, manufacturers must adhere to the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations and similar regulations in foreign countries, which the applicable regulatory authorities enforce through facilities inspection programs. Our contract manufacturers may not comply or maintain compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or similar foreign regulations. Non-compliance could significantly delay or prevent receipt of marketing authorization for our drugs, including authorizations for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, or result in enforcement action after authorization that could limit the commercial success of our drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development.\nWe depend on third parties to conduct our clinical studies for our drugs and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect our development and commercialization plans.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct the clinical studies for our drugs and expect to continue to do so in the future. For example, we use clinical research organizations for the clinical studies for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical studies, but do not control many aspects of their activities. For example, the investigators are not our employees. However, we are responsible for ensuring that these third parties conduct each of our clinical studies in accordance with the general investigational plan, approved protocols for the study and applicable regulations. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations or a termination of our relationship with these third parties could delay or prevent the development, marketing authorization and commercialization of our drugs, including authorizations for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development.\nWe may seek to form additional partnerships in the future with respect to volanesorsen, and our other drugs in development, and we may not realize the benefits of such partnerships.\nAlthough we intend to develop and commercialize volanesorsen for patients with FCS and FPL ourselves, we may form partnerships, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties for the development and commercialization of our drugs in development. For example, we have granted Novartis an exclusive option to exclusively license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Any delays in entering into new strategic partnership agreements related to our drugs could delay the development and commercialization of our drugs and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other collaborative arrangement for any additional drugs because the potential partner may consider that our development pipeline is not advanced enough to justify a collaborative effort, or that volanesorsen and our other drugs in development do not have the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the target populations. In addition, we will need to mutually agree with Ionis on the terms of any sublicense to a third party for volanesorsen and our other drugs in development. If we cannot mutually agree on terms for a sublicense to a third party or if Ionis does not agree to a sublicense at all, it could delay our ability to develop and commercialize volanesorsen and our other drugs in development. Even if we are successful in establishing such a strategic partnership or collaboration, we cannot be certain that, following such a strategic transaction or collaboration, we will be able to progress the development and commercialization of the applicable drugs as envisioned, or that we will achieve the revenue that would justify such transaction. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular drug, we may relinquish valuable rights to that drug through future collaboration, licensing or other arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Ionis\nIonis controls the direction of our business, and the concentrated ownership of our common stock will prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant decisions.\nIonis owns approximately 68% of the economic interest and voting power of our outstanding common stock. As long as Ionis beneficially controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, it will generally be able to determine the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors. Even if Ionis were to control less than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, it may influence the outcome of such corporate actions so long as it owns a significant portion of our common stock. If Ionis continues to hold its shares of our common stock, it could remain our controlling stockholder for an extended period of time or indefinitely.\nIonis' interests may not be the same as, or may conflict with, the interests of our other stockholders. You will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote while Ionis controls the majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Ionis can control, directly or indirectly and subject to applicable law, all matters affecting us, including:\n\u25cf\nany determination with respect to our business strategy and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers and directors;\n\u25cf\nany determinations with respect to mergers, business combinations or disposition of assets;\n\u25cf\nour financing and dividend policy;\n\u25cf\ncompensation and benefit programs and other human resources policy decisions;\n\u25cf\ntermination of, changes to or determinations under our development, commercialization and license agreement, which we refer to as the license agreement, and services agreement with Ionis;\n\u25cf\nchanges to any other agreements that may adversely affect us; and\n\u25cf\ndeterminations with respect to our tax returns.\nBecause Ionis' interests may differ from ours or yours, actions that Ionis takes with respect to us, as our controlling stockholder, may not be favorable to us or you.\nIf Ionis sells a controlling interest in our company to a third party in a private transaction, you may not realize a change of control premium on shares of our common stock, and we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party.\nIonis owns a significant equity interest in our company. This means that Ionis could choose to sell some or all of its shares of our common stock in a privately negotiated transaction, which, if sufficient in size, could result in a change of control of our company.\nIonis' ability to privately sell its shares of our common stock, with no requirement for a concurrent offer to be made to acquire your shares of our common stock, could prevent you from realizing any change of control premium on your shares of our common stock that may otherwise accrue to Ionis on its private sale of our common stock. Additionally, if Ionis privately sells its significant equity interest in our company, we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party. Such third party may have conflicts of interest with those of other stockholders. In addition, if Ionis sells a controlling interest in our company to a third party, such a sale could negatively impact or accelerate any future indebtedness we may incur, and negatively impact any other commercial agreements and relationships, all of which may adversely affect our ability to run our business as described herein and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nCertain of our directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with Ionis.\nStanley T. Crooke, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer for Ionis, and B. Lynne Parshall, Senior Strategic Advisor and board member for Ionis, serve on our board of directors and retain their positions or engagements with Ionis. In addition, these individuals own Ionis equity and Ionis equity awards. Ionis common stock, options to purchase Ionis common stock and other Ionis equity awards represent a significant portion of these individuals' net worth. Their position at Ionis and the ownership of any Ionis equity or equity awards creates, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when we ask these individuals to make decisions that could have different implications for Ionis than the decisions have for us. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides for the allocation of certain corporate opportunities between us and Ionis. Under these provisions, neither Ionis or its other affiliates, nor any of their officers, directors, agents or stockholders, will have any obligation to present to us certain corporate opportunities. For example, a director of our company who also serves as a director, officer or employee of Ionis or any of its other affiliates may present to Ionis certain acquisitions, in-licenses, potential development programs or other opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, such opportunities may not be available to us. To the extent attractive corporate opportunities are allocated to Ionis or its other affiliates instead of to us, we may not be able to benefit from these opportunities.\nThe resources Ionis provides us under the license agreement and the services agreement may not be sufficient for us to operate as a standalone company, and we may experience difficulty in separating our resources from Ionis.\nBecause we have not operated separately from Ionis in the past, we may have difficulty doing so. We will need to acquire resources in addition to, and eventually in lieu of, those provided by Ionis to our company, and may also face difficulty in separating our resources from Ionis' resources and integrating newly acquired resources into our business. In addition, Ionis may prioritize its own research, development, manufacturing and other needs ahead of the services Ionis has agreed to provide us, or Ionis employees who conduct services for us may prioritize Ionis' interests over our interests. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if we have difficulty operating as a standalone company, fail to acquire resources that prove to be important to our operations or incur unexpected costs in separating our resources from Ionis' resources or integrating newly acquired resources.\nWe will incur incremental costs as a standalone company.\nIonis currently performs or supports many important corporate functions for our company. Our consolidated financial statements reflect charges for these services on an allocation basis. Under our services agreement with Ionis we can use these Ionis services for a fixed term established on a service-by-service basis. However, we generally will have the right to terminate a service earlier if we give notice to Ionis. Partial reduction in the provision of any service requires Ionis' consent. In addition, either party will be able to terminate the agreement due to a material breach of the other party, upon prior written notice, subject to limited cure periods.\nWe will pay Ionis mutually agreed upon fees for these services, based on Ionis' costs of providing the services. Since we negotiated the services agreement in the context of a parent subsidiary relationship, the terms of the agreement, including the fees charged for the services, may be higher or lower than those that would be agreed to by parties bargaining at arm's length for similar services and may be higher or lower than the costs reflected in the allocations in our historical consolidated financial statements. Ionis will pass third party costs through to us at Ionis' cost. In addition, while Ionis provides us these services, our operational flexibility to modify or implement changes with respect to such services or the amounts we pay for them will be limited.\nWe may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate third-party agreements on terms and conditions, including cost, comparable to those that we will receive from Ionis under our services agreement. Additionally, after the agreement terminates, we may not sustain the services at the same levels or obtain the same benefits as when we were receiving such services and benefits from Ionis. When we begin to operate these functions separately, if we do not have our own adequate systems and business functions in place, or cannot obtain them from other providers, we may not operate our business effectively or at comparable costs, and our business may suffer. In addition, we have historically received informal support from Ionis, which may not be addressed in our services agreement. The level of this informal support will diminish and could end in the future.\nWe may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits of our license agreement with Ionis.\nWe have a development, commercialization and license agreement with Ionis. Pursuant to the license agreement, subject to certain restrictions, we and Ionis will share development responsibilities for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development. We are paying for research and development costs and reimbursing Ionis for Ionis' employees supporting our development activities. Until we build or acquire our own capabilities to replace those Ionis is providing to us, particularly development, regulatory and manufacturing services, we will be heavily dependent on Ionis.\nWhile we and Ionis intend the license agreement to bolster our capabilities, certain terms of the license agreement may limit our ability to achieve this expected benefit, including:\n\u25cf\na Joint Steering Committee, or JSC, comprising two senior members from our company and two senior members from Ionis, sets the development strategy for our drugs by mutual agreement. A Regulatory Sub-committee, established by the JSC and having equal membership from our company and Ionis, will set the regulatory strategy for each of our drugs by mutual agreement. If the JSC or the Regulatory Sub-committee cannot come to a mutual agreement, it could delay our ability to develop and commercialize volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development;\n\u25cf\nwe will need to mutually agree with Ionis on the terms of any additional sublicense to a third party for volanesorsen and our other drugs in development. If we cannot mutually agree on terms for a sublicense to a third party or if Ionis does not agree to a sublicense at all, it could delay or prevent our ability to develop and commercialize volanesorsen and our other drugs in development;\n\u25cf\nwe will need to obtain Ionis' approval to in-license a product, acquire a product or acquire another company, until the earlier of (i) 5 years following our IPO or (ii) when Ionis no longer is required to record its share of our profits and losses from an accounting perspective; and\n\u25cf\nthere is nothing in our agreements with Ionis to prevent Ionis from developing and commercializing drugs targeting RNAs that are not apoC-III, Apo(a) or ANGPTL3 to pursue the same indications we are pursuing with our drugs.\nEach of the foregoing terms and Ionis' other rights under the license agreement, could limit our ability to realize the expected benefits of the license agreement or otherwise limit our ability to pursue transactions or development efforts other stockholders may view as beneficial. Further, if Ionis does not continue to own a significant portion of our equity, Ionis' incentive to help us would be diminished. If we fail to achieve the expected benefits of our agreements with Ionis, it may be more difficult, time consuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, or may result in our drugs being later to market than those of our competitors or prevent them from ever getting to market. If these events cause delays in new product development we could lose the first in class products in a given therapeutic area.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we breach our obligations under our license agreement with Ionis, we could lose our rights to volanesorsen and our other drugs in development.\nWe obtained our rights to volanesorsen and our other drugs in development under our license agreement with Ionis. If we breach our obligations under this license agreement and, as a result, Ionis subsequently exercises its right to terminate it, we generally would not be able to continue to develop or commercialize volanesorsen, and our other drugs in development that incorporate Ionis' intellectual property, and Ionis would receive a royalty-free, nonexclusive license to our improvements to those programs, meaning we would lose the benefits of our investment in these programs. If we breach our obligations under this license agreement with respect to AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and, as a result, Ionis exercises its right to terminate it, then our strategic collaboration with Novartis would convert into a direct strategic collaboration between Novartis and Ionis, and Ionis would receive all of the revenue and other benefits associated with that strategic collaboration.\nIf we cannot protect our patent rights or our other proprietary rights, others may compete more effectively against us.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon whether we can continue to secure and maintain intellectual property rights that protect volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development. However, patents may not issue from any of our pending patent applications in the United States or in other countries and we may not be able to obtain, maintain or enforce our owned or licensed patents and other intellectual property rights which could impact our ability to compete effectively. In addition, the scope of any of our owned or licensed patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide us with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, other parties may successfully challenge, invalidate or circumvent our issued patents or patents licensed to us so that our patent rights do not create an effective competitive barrier or revenue source.\nComposition of matter patents on the active pharmaceutical ingredient for a product are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. Our volanesorsen patent portfolio currently includes:\n\u25cf\nissued patent claims to the specific antisense sequence and chemical composition of volanesorsen in the United States, Australia, and Europe;\n\u25cf\nissued patent claims in the United States and Australia drawn to the use of antisense compounds complementary to an active region of human apoC-III messenger ribonucleic acid, including the site targeted by volanesorsen;\n\u25cf\nadditional patent applications designed to protect the volanesorsen composition in Canada; and\n\u25cf\nadditional methods of use in jurisdictions worldwide for volanesorsen.\nThe natural term of the issued U.S. patent covering the volanesorsen composition of matter will expire in 2023, but we plan to seek to extend the U.S. patent expiration beyond 2023 based upon the development and regulatory review period in the United States. The natural term of the granted European and Australian patents covering volanesorsen will expire in 2024, but we plan to seek to extend each of these patents beyond 2024 based upon the development and regulatory review periods in Europe and Australia.\nWe cannot be certain that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and courts in the United States or the patent offices and courts in foreign countries will consider the claims in our owned or licensed patents and applications covering volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development as patentable. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products off-label. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent, including through legal action.\nIf we or any licensor partner loses or cannot obtain patent protection for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or our other drugs in development it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and prevent us from pursuing our programs.\nFrom time to time we may have to defend our intellectual property rights. If we are involved in an intellectual property dispute, we may need to litigate to defend our rights or assert them against others. Disputes can involve arbitration, litigation or proceedings declared by the U.S. PTO or the International Trade Commission or foreign patent authorities. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our strategic partners to develop, manufacture, market and sell our drugs and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights and intellectual property of third parties. Extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may in the future become party to, or threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our drugs and technology, including interference, derivation, reexamination, post-grant review, opposition, cancellation or similar proceedings before the U.S. PTO or its foreign counterparts. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our drugs and their uses. If a third party claims that volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, our other drugs in development or our technology infringe its patents or other intellectual property rights, we or our partners may have to discontinue an important product or product line, alter our products and processes, pay license fees or cease certain activities. We may not be able to obtain a license to needed intellectual property on favorable terms, if at all. There are many patents issued or applied for in the biotechnology industry, and we may not be aware of patents or patent applications held by others that relate to our business. This is especially true since patent applications in the United States are filed confidentially for the first 18 months. Moreover, the validity and breadth of biotechnology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal issues remain. Thus, we do not know with certainty that our drugs or our intended commercialization thereof, does and will not infringe or otherwise violate any third party's intellectual property.\nWe will not seek to protect our intellectual property rights in all jurisdictions throughout the world and we may not be able to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights even in the jurisdictions where we seek protection.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on drugs in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States could be less extensive than those we could obtain in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions.\nCompetitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we do not pursue and obtain patent protection to develop their own products. In addition, competitors may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patent rights or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Even if we pursue and obtain issued patents in particular jurisdictions, our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent third parties from so competing.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to biotechnology. This could make it difficult for us to stop competitors from infringing our patent rights or misappropriating our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit our right to enforce our patent rights against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. We must ultimately seek patent protection on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nIn addition, proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patent rights at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our owned or licensed patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIf we do not obtain additional protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar foreign legislation by extending the patent protection for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the first FDA marketing authorization of volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, a United States patent that we own or license may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments allow the owner of an approved product to extend patent protection for up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. During this period of extension, the scope of protection is limited to the approved product and approved uses.\nAlthough we plan on seeking patent term restoration for our products, we may not succeed if, for example, we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we cannot obtain patent term restoration or the term of any such patent restoration is less than we request, our competitors may enter the market and compete against us sooner than we anticipate, and our ability to generate revenue could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in United States patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nRecent United States Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the United States Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. PTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nIf we and our partners do not adequately protect the trademarks and trade names for our products, then we and our partners may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur competitors or other third parties may challenge, infringe or circumvent the trademarks or trade names for our products. We and our partners may not be able to protect these trademarks and trade names. In addition, if the trademarks or trade names for one of our products infringe the rights of others, we or our partners may be forced to stop using the trademarks or trade names, which we need for name recognition in our markets of interest. If we cannot establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we and our partners may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u25cf\nothers may make compounds that are similar to our drugs but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u25cf\nwe, or our license partners or current or future strategic partners, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u25cf\nwe, or our license partners or current or future strategic partners, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering our inventions;\n\u25cf\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nour pending licensed patent applications or those that we own in the future may not lead to issued patents;\n\u25cf\nissued patents that we hold rights to may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u25cf\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u25cf\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe will need to significantly increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe are currently a small company. To commercialize volanesorsen, and our other drugs in development that we are responsible for commercializing, we will need to increase our operations and expand our use of third-party contractors. We plan to continue to build our compliance, financial and operating infrastructure to ensure the maintenance of a well-managed company including hiring additional staff within our regulatory, clinical and medical affairs groups and an in-house commercial organization initially focused on marketing and selling volanesorsen, if approved. We currently have limited sales and marketing capability and therefore intend to recruit a specialty sales force in anticipation of volanesorsen's potential approval.\nFuture growth will impose significant added responsibilities on our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees. In addition, to meet our obligations as a public company, we will need to increase our general and administrative capabilities. Our current management, personnel and systems may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our drugs and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u25cf\nmanage our clinical studies and the regulatory process effectively;\n\u25cf\nmanage the manufacturing of our drugs for clinical and commercial use;\n\u25cf\nintegrate current and additional management, administrative, financial and sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf\ndevelop a marketing and sales infrastructure;\n\u25cf\nhire new personnel necessary to effectively commercialize volanesorsen and our other drugs in development;\n\u25cf\ndevelop our administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls; and\n\u25cf\nhire and train additional qualified personnel.\nOur staff, financial resources, systems, procedures or controls may be inadequate to support our operations and our management may be unable to successfully manage future market opportunities or our relationships with customers and other third parties.\nIf we do not progress in our programs as anticipated, the price of our securities could decrease.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate and may disclose the timing of a variety of clinical, regulatory and other milestones, such as when we anticipate a certain drug will enter into clinical trials, when we anticipate completing a clinical study, when we anticipate filing an application for marketing authorization, or when we or our partners plan to commercially launch a drug. We base our estimates on present facts and a variety of assumptions. Many underlying assumptions are outside of our control. If we do not achieve milestones in accordance with our or our investors' or securities analysts' expectations, including milestones related to volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development, the price of our securities could decrease.\nThe loss of key personnel, or if we cannot attract and retain highly skilled personnel, could make it more difficult to run our business and reduce our likelihood of success.\nWe are dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers that would prevent them from leaving us. The loss of management and key scientific employees might slow the achievement of important research and development goals. It is also critical to our success that we recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel to perform development work and marketing, sales and commercial support personnel to perform commercialization activities. We may not be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced scientific and commercial personnel on acceptable terms because of intense competition for experienced personnel among many pharmaceutical and health care companies, universities and non-profit research institutions. In addition, failure to successfully complete clinical studies, obtain regulatory approvals or effectively commercialize drugs may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel.\nWe are exposed to potential product liability claims, and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future or at all.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of therapeutic products, including potential product liability claims related to volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development. We have clinical study insurance coverage and commercial product liability insurance coverage. In addition, Novartis has agreed to indemnify us against specific claims arising from Novartis' development and commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. However, this insurance coverage and indemnities may not be adequate to cover claims against us. Insurance may not be available to us at an acceptable cost, if at all. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, products liability claims may result in decreased demand for our drug products, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical study volunteers and loss of revenue. Thus, whether or not we are insured or indemnified, a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material.\nBecause we use biological materials, hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds, if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur development and manufacturing activities involve the use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause:\n\u25cf\ninterruption of our development, manufacturing and distribution efforts;\n\u25cf\ninjury to our employees and others;\n\u25cf\nenvironmental damage resulting in costly clean up; and\n\u25cf\nliabilities under federal, state and local laws and regulations governing health and human safety, as well as the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and resultant waste products.\nIn such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. Although we carry insurance in amounts and types that we consider commercially reasonable, we do not have insurance coverage for losses relating to an interruption of our development, manufacturing or commercialization efforts caused by contamination, and the coverage or coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate. If our losses exceed our insurance coverage, our financial condition would be adversely affected.\nA variety of risks associated with operating our business and, following approval, marketing our drugs internationally could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we plan to establish operations and, following approval, commercialize our products in Europe and other countries globally. We face risks associated with our current and planned international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, pricing and reimbursement, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. Once we establish international operations we will be subject to numerous risks associated with international business activities, including:\n\u25cf\ncompliance with differing or unexpected regulatory requirements for our drugs and foreign employees;\n\u25cf\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors or patient self-pay systems;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf\nin certain circumstances, increased dependence on the commercialization efforts and regulatory compliance of third-party distributors or strategic partners;\n\u25cf\nforeign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements;\n\u25cf\nU.S. and foreign government tariffs, trade restrictions, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nanti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and its equivalent in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u25cf\neconomic weakness, including inflation, natural disasters, war, events of terrorism or political instability in particular foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations related to doing business in another country;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with tax, employment, privacy, immigration and labor laws, regulations and restrictions for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u25cf\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships.\nThe UK's anticipated exit from the European Union could increase these risks.\nOur business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K.'s Bribery Act 2010. In many other countries, the healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, any dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to regulation under the FCPA. There is no certainty that all employees and third-party business partners (including our distributors, wholesalers, agents, contractors and other partners) will comply with anti-bribery laws. In particular, we do not control the actions of manufacturers and other third-party agents, although we may be liable for their actions. Violation of these laws may result in civil or criminal sanctions, which could include monetary fines, criminal penalties, and disgorgement of past profits, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nIf a natural or man-made disaster strikes our development or manufacturing facilities or otherwise affects our business, it could delay our progress developing and commercializing our drugs.\nWe currently rely on Ionis to manufacture our clinical supplies in a manufacturing facility located in Carlsbad, California. The facilities and the equipment required to develop and manufacture our drugs would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. Natural or man-made disasters, including, without limitation, earthquakes, floods, fires and acts of terrorism may harm these facilities. If a disaster affects these facilities, our and our partners' development and commercialization efforts would be delayed. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, a shutdown of the U.S. government, including the FDA could harm or delay our development and commercialization activities.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our CROs, manufacturers and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If issues were to arise and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug programs. For example, the loss of clinical study data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical studies could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\" and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies\" including, but not limited to, the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAn active public trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nPrior to the completion of our IPO in July 2017, no public market for our common stock existed. An active public trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares. Additionally, Ionis owns approximately 68% of our outstanding common stock. Ionis intends to hold its shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future, which could reduce the public market for our stock.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile, which could contribute to the loss of your investment.\nFluctuations in the price of our common stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. There has been a public market for our common stock for a limited period of time. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our common stock and our common stock may trade at prices significantly below your purchase price. In such circumstances the trading price of our common stock may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:\n\u25cf\nour failure to effectively develop and commercialize volanesorsen and our other drugs in development;\n\u25cf\nNovartis' failure to exercise its option and/or effectively develop and commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx to the extent it exercises its option to license those drugs from us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market's expectations about our operating results;\n\u25cf\nadverse results or delays in preclinical or clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nour decision to initiate a clinical study, not to initiate a clinical study or to terminate an existing clinical study;\n\u25cf\nadverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development;\n\u25cf\nsuccess or failure of competitive products or antisense drugs more generally;\n\u25cf\nadverse developments concerning our manufacturers or our strategic partnerships;\n\u25cf\ninability to obtain adequate product supply for any drug for clinical studies or commercial sale or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u25cf\nthe termination of a strategic partnership or the inability to establish additional strategic partnerships;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development;\n\u25cf\nadverse safety or other clinical results, such as those that have occurred in the past or that may occur in the future, related to drugs being developed by Ionis or other companies that are or may be perceived to be similar to our drugs;\n\u25cf\nour ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u25cf\nthe size and growth, if any, of the targeted market;\n\u25cf\nour operating results do not meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\nsecurities analysts do not publish reports about us or our business or publish negative reports;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company, our market opportunity, or the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries in general;\n\u25cf\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new drugs or programs, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nour and our strategic partners' ability to successfully market volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business, including but not limited to clinical study requirements for approvals;\n\u25cf\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development;\n\u25cf\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving our company, our general industry, or both;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u25cf\nthe volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u25cf\nany major change in our board or management;\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting practices;\n\u25cf\nineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u25cf\nsignificant changes in our relationship with Ionis;\n\u25cf\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, elections, drug pricing policies, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and NASDAQ and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of ours, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for biotechnology or pharmaceutical stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us, the opportunities in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical market or the stock market in general, could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market may cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Immediately following our IPO and concurrent private placement we had 66,541,629 shares of common stock outstanding. Of these, only 14,843,750 shares of our common stock sold in our IPO are freely transferable without restriction or additional registration under the Securities Act. Novartis has agreed that it will not sell any of the shares it purchased in the concurrent private placement until the earlier of January 5, 2020 or six months after we stop developing a drug under our agreement with Novartis. Thereafter, Novartis may only sell a limited number of shares each day. Up to an additional 45,447,879 shares of common stock held by Ionis are eligible for sale in the public market, all of which will be subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, 9,000,000 shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules, the lock-up agreements and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. To the extent the holders of these shares sell them into the market or our stockholders believe these sales might occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe cannot predict with certainty whether or when Ionis will sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock. Ionis' sale of a substantial number of shares, or a perception that such sales could occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our operations. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. As a result, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nThe United States recently passed a comprehensive tax reform bill that could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. The changes include, but are not limited to, reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense, limitation on the utilization of net operating losses to 80% of taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, a mandatory one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introduction of bonus depreciation that allows for full expensing of qualified property, and modifying or repealing many business tax deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain, and our financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if, and to what extent various states will conform to the new tax law and foreign countries may react by adopting tax legislation or taking other actions that could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect our tax obligations, effective tax rate and operating results.\nThe Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact our tax obligations, effective tax rate and our results of operations. The Tax Act will likely be subject to ongoing technical guidance and accounting interpretation, which we will continue to monitor and assess. It is not possible to fully measure the potential impact on our business, prospects or results of operations at this time.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and sales taxes in the United States and foreign income taxes, withholding taxes and transaction taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value-added taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period for which a determination is made.\nWe could be subject to securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u25cf\nauthorize \"blank check\" preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u25cf\nspecify that only board of directors or holders of greater than 10% of our common stock can call special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u25cf\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent once Ionis no longer holds a majority of our voting power;\n\u25cf\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u25cf\nprovide that a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum, may fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u25cf\nspecify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors;\n\u25cf\nexpressly authorize our board of directors to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u25cf\nrequire supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. Further, Novartis has agreed that until Novartis holds less than 7.5% of our outstanding common stock, Novartis will vote the Novartis Private Placement Shares consistent with the recommendation of our board of directors. Although Novartis has retained the right to vote the Novartis Private Placement Shares in its sole discretion in connection with certain enumerated matters, including any transaction which would result in our change of control, our agreement with Novartis may nevertheless delay or prevent changes in our management or board of directors.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in the State of Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and federal court within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that our stockholders may initiate, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur bylaws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and federal court within the State of Delaware will be exclusive forums for any:\n\u25cf\nderivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u25cf\naction asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders;\n\u25cf\naction asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or\n\u25cf\nother action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our bylaws described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 16814, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AKCA"}
