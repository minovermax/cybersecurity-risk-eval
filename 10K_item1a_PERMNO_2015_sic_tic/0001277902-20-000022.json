{"cik": "1277902", "company": "MVB FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects. Other factors that could affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations are discussed in the \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d section below (Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nReferences to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section refer to the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, unless otherwise specified or unless the context otherwise requires.\nRisks Related to Economic and Market Conditions\nOur business depends upon the general economic conditions of the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia, and may be adversely affected by downturns in these and the other local economies in which we operate.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate, including the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nWhile the U.S. economy experienced growth during 2019, with increasing exports, jobs, and manufacturing production, continued economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Such conditions, combined with continued oil price volatility, could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of our loans and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia and the specific local markets in which we operate. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers across West Virginia and Virginia. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources. Moreover, approximately 46.8% of the securities in our municipal securities portfolio were issued by political subdivisions or agencies within the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia. A significant decline in general economic conditions in State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia, whether caused by recession, inflation, unemployment, changes in oil prices, changes in securities markets, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our loans are secured by real estate concentrated in the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia, which may adversely affect our earnings and capital if real estate values decline.\nNearly 75.2% of our total loans are real estate interests (residential, nonresidential including both owner-occupied and investment real estate, and construction and land development) mainly concentrated in the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia, a relatively small geographic area. As a result, declining real estate values in these markets could negatively impact the value of the real estate collateral securing such loans. If we are required to liquidate a significant amount of collateral during a period of reduced real estate values in satisfaction of any non-performing or defaulted loans, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFollowing the U.S. presidential election in 2016, there has been discussion and dialogue regarding potential changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could impact the prices of our customers\u2019 products, which could reduce demand for such products, reduce our customers\u2019 margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service their debt. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics, acts of war or terrorism or other external events could have significant effects on our business.\nSevere weather and natural disasters, including tornados, drought and floods, epidemics and pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other external events or the fear of such events could have a significant effect on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base; impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery and business continuity policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic, trade wars, tariffs, and similar events and disputes, domestic and international, have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect economic activity globally, nationally and locally. Market interest rates have declined significantly. Such events also may adversely affect business and consumer confidence, generally. We and our customers, and our respective suppliers, vendors and processors may be adversely affected. Any such adverse changes may adversely affect our profitability, growth asset quality and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak is ongoing, and its dynamic nature, including uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to treat its impact. The Federal Reserve stated on February 28, 2020 that it was closely monitoring coronavirus developments and their effects on the economic outlook, and would act appropriately to support the economy. On March 3, 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1.00% to 1.25%. The Federal Reserve also announced it was purchasing Treasury bills into the second quarter of 2020, conducting overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through April 2020, and will continue to reinvest amounts of principal received by the Federal Reserve on its portfolio of treasury and agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. Lastly, the Federal Reserve also reduced the interest it pays on excess reserves from 1.60% to 1.10%. We expect that such reductions in interest rates will adversely affect our net interest income and margins, and our profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur nonresidential real estate loans expose us to greater risks of nonpayment and loss than residential mortgage loans, which may cause us to increase our allowance for loan losses which would reduce our net income.\nAt December 31, 2019, $1.1 billion, or 77.7%, of our loan portfolio consisted of nonresidential real estate loans. Nonresidential real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans expose us to additional risks because they typically are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower\u2019s business and are secured by collateral that may depreciate over time. These loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential mortgage loans. Because such loans generally entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans, which would reduce our net income. Also, many of our nonresidential real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan.\nOur allowance for loan losses could become inadequate and reduce earnings and capital.\nThe Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses that it believes is adequate for absorbing the estimated future losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Management conducts a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses based upon general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio and performance of the Bank\u2019s clients relative to their financial obligations with it. The amount of future losses, however, is susceptible to changes in economic and other market conditions, including changes in interest rates and collateral values, which are beyond the Bank\u2019s control, and these future losses may exceed its current estimates. Management performs stress tests on the loan portfolios to estimate future loan losses, but additional provisions for loan losses could be required in the future, including as a result of changes in the economic assumptions underlying management\u2019s estimates and judgments, adverse developments in the economy on a national basis or in the Bank\u2019s market area, or changes in the circumstances of particular borrowers. We cannot predict with absolute certainty the amount of losses or guarantee that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb future losses in the loan portfolio. Excessive loan losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe profitability of MVB Mortgage will be significantly reduced if we are not able to sell mortgages.\nCurrently, we generally sell all of the mortgage loans originated by MVB Mortgage. The profitability of MVB Mortgage depends in large part upon our ability to originate a high volume of loans and to sell them in the secondary market. Thus, we are dependent upon (i) the existence of an active secondary market and (ii) our ability to sell loans into that market. Volatile interest rate environments could increase this risk initially. However, past performance supports the Company's ability to fund the increase in MVB Mortgage\u2019s production.\nMVB Mortgage\u2019s ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Some of the largest participants in the secondary market, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are government-sponsored enterprises with substantial market influence whose activities are governed by federal law. Any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of these government-sponsored enterprises and other institutional and non-institutional investors or any impairment of our ability to participate in such programs could, in turn, adversely affect our operations.\nOur largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.\nThe Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The Bank\u2019s earnings depend primarily upon its net interest income, which is the difference between its interest income earned on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and its interest expense paid on its interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of deposits and borrowings. Moreover, the loans included in our interest-earning assets are primarily comprised of variable and adjustable rate loans. Net interest income is subject to interest rate risk in the following ways:\n\u2022In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets\nand liabilities with longer remaining maturities. The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently.\n\u2022The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates decline sharply, loans may prepay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income. Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to maturity (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.\n\u2022Re-pricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times. For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets re-price faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings. Moreover, if assets and liabilities re-price at the same time, they may not be by the same increment. For instance, if the Federal Funds Rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points; whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.\nFinancial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates. This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes to net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates. Interest rate risk is more fully described under the section captioned \u201cInterest Rate Risk\u201d in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in the section captioned \u201cInterest Rate Sensitivity Management\u201d in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area and failure to effectively compete could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and community banks within the various markets where we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Also, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. For example, consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Further, many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022The ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets.\n\u2022The ability to expand our market position.\n\u2022The scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands.\n\u2022The rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors.\n\u2022Customer satisfaction with our level of service.\n\u2022Industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $23.1 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nWe are focused on our long-term growth and have undertaken various new business initiatives, many of which involve activities that are new to us, or in some cases, are in the early stages of development. From time to time, we may develop, grow and/or acquire new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets for these products and services are not fully developed. For example, the Company is involved in new innovative strategies to provide independent banking to corporate clients throughout the United States by leveraging recent investments in Fintech. We also acquired Chartwell Compliance in September of 2019 which provides integrated regulatory compliance, state licensing, financial crimes prevention and enterprise risk management services that include consulting, outsourcing, testing and training solutions. Given our evolving business and product diversification, these new initiatives may subject us to, among other risks, increased business, reputational and operational risk, as well as more complex legal, regulatory and compliance costs and risks. Furthermore, the Bank has several large depositor relationships that are concentrated in the Fintech industry and the loss of any relationship could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources.\nIn developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. All service offerings, including current offerings and those which may be provided in the future, may become more risky due to changes in economic, competitive and market conditions beyond our control.\nOur investments in financial technology companies and initiatives subject us to material financial, reputational and strategic risks.\nOur investments in various financial technology companies have had a significant impact on our results of operations, and we anticipate they will continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations in the future. For any investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For investments accounted for under the equity method, we would increase or decrease our investment by our proportionate share of the investee\u2019s net income or loss. For any investments where we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under ASU 2016-01, where changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes arising from orderly transactions are recognized in net income. We also periodically evaluate our investments for impairment. See Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for more information.\nAny earnings from our financial technology investments can be volatile and difficult to predict. Furthermore, we invest in many of these financial technology companies for strategic purposes. Where we are a minority shareholder, we may be unable to influence the activities of these organizations which could have an adverse impact on our ability to execute our strategic initiatives and successfully develop and implement the banking platform we are developing with these and other partners.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\nWe generally seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either\nsignificant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company.\n\u2022Exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company.\n\u2022Potential disruption to our business.\n\u2022Potential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention.\n\u2022The possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company.\n\u2022Difficulty in estimating the value of the target company.\n\u2022Potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt our ability to meet our financial obligations.\nLiquidity refers to the ability of the Company to ensure sufficient levels of cash to fund operations, such as meeting deposit withdrawals, funding loan commitments, paying expenses and meeting quarterly payment obligations under certain subordinated debentures issued by the Company in connection with the issuance of floating rate redeemable trust preferred securities. The source of the funds for the Company\u2019s debt obligations is dependent on the Bank.\nAny significant restriction or disruption of the Company\u2019s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nLimited availability of borrowings and liquidity from the FHLB system and other sources could negatively impact earnings.\nThe Bank is currently a member bank of the FHLB of Pittsburgh. Membership in this system of quasi-governmental, regional home-loan oriented agency banks allows us to participate in various programs offered by the FHLB. We borrow funds from the FHLB, which are secured by a blanket lien on certain residential and commercial mortgage loans, and if applicable, investment securities with collateral values in excess of the outstanding balances. Current and future earnings shortfalls and minimum capital requirements of the FHLB may impact the collateral necessary to secure borrowings and limit the borrowings extended to their member banks, as well as require additional capital contributions by member banks. Should this occur, our short-term liquidity needs could be negatively impacted. If we were restricted from using FHLB advances due to weakness in the system or with the FHLB of Pittsburgh, we may be forced to find alternative funding sources. If we are required to rely more heavily on higher cost funding sources, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover these costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and financial position.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain the skilled people necessary to conduct our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them. Many of our branches are located in rural areas and small towns where the competition for labor can be fierce, and where the pool of qualified employees may be small. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nInterruption to our information systems or breaches in security, including as a result of cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations or otherwise harm our business.\nThe Company relies on information systems and communications for operating and monitoring all major aspects of business, as well as internal management functions. Any failure, interruption, intrusion or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the customer relationship, management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.\nThere have been several cyber-attacks on websites of large financial services companies. Even if not directed at the Company specifically, attacks on other entities with whom we do business or on whom we otherwise rely or attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of our business.\nCyber-attacks on third party retailers or other business establishments that widely accept debit card or check payments could compromise sensitive Bank customer information, such as debit card and account numbers. Such an attack could result in significant costs to the Bank, such as costs to reimburse customers, reissue debit cards and open new customer accounts.\nIn addition, there have been efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at financial institutions, including through the use of social engineering schemes such as \u201cphishing.\u201d The ability of our customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches. Because the techniques used to attack financial services company communications and information systems change frequently (and generally increase in sophistication), attacks are often not recognized until launched against a target and we may be unable to address these techniques in advance of attacks, including by implementing adequate preventative measures. We may also be unable to prevent attacks that are supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities and that may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world.\nThe occurrence of any such failure, disruption or security breach of our information systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to our customers, could damage our reputation and our relationships with our partners and customers, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. These risks could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continually encounter technological change and failure to continually adapt to such change could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, or deposit funds electronically with banks having no branches within our market area, which could affect net income.\nTechnology and other changes allow parties to complete financial transactions without banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. Consumers can also shop for higher deposit interest rates at banks across the country, which may offer higher rates because they have few or no physical branches and open deposit accounts electronically. This process could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of client deposits and the income generated from those deposits, in addition to increasing our funding costs.\nOur operations rely on certain external vendors who may not perform in a satisfactory manner.\nWe are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements. We maintain a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks including, among other things, (i) changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, (ii) changes in the vendor\u2019s financial condition and (iii) changes in the vendor\u2019s support for existing products and services. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or the service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the business and its financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal\ninjury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties which, if inaccurate, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment\nChanges in tax laws, including those included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, may adversely affect our performance and create the risk that we may need to adjust our accounting for these changes.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to our taxes could have a material adverse effect on our performance. In addition, our customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by our customers may adversely affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products, which could adversely affect their demand for our loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on our customers could result in defaults on the loans we have made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which we have invested.\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, formally known as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d) was enacted into law. This tax legislation made significant changes to U.S. tax laws and includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, such as ours. Among other things, the Tax Reform Act (i) establishes a new, flat corporate federal statutory income tax rate of 21%, (ii) eliminates the corporate alternative minimum tax and allows the use of any such carryforwards to offset regular tax liability for any taxable year, (iii) limits the deduction for net interest expense incurred by U.S. corporations, (iv) allows businesses to immediately expense, for tax purposes, the cost of new investments in certain qualified depreciable assets, (v) eliminates or reduces certain deductions related to meals and entertainment expenses, (vi) modifies the limitation on excessive employee remuneration to eliminate the exception for performance-based compensation and clarifies the definition of a covered employee and (vii) limits the deductibility of deposit insurance premiums. The Tax Reform Act is still unclear in certain respects and, while the Internal Revenue Service has issued proposed regulations with respect to the Tax Reform Act, many of the regulations are not yet finalized and will require additional interpretation and implementation by the Internal Revenue Service, state tax authorities and courts. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as a result of the Tax Reform Act, the Company was required to re-measure its deferred tax asset, resulting in an income tax charge of $646 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. Any future regulation, court decision, legislation or Internal Revenue Service interpretation could lessen or increase the adverse (and positive) impacts of the Tax Reform Act, which in-turn could affect our current or future financial statements.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions that could detrimentally affect our business.\nWe, primarily through the Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we\nmay offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputational damage. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor further detail, see the sections captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d included in Item 1, Business, and Note 14, \u201cRegulatory Capital Requirements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFailure to meet any of the various capital adequacy guidelines which we are subject to could adversely affect our operations and could compromise the status of the Company as a financial holding company.\nThe Company and the Bank are required to meet certain regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the U.S. Department of Treasury. If the Company or the Bank fails to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected and could compromise the status of the Company as a banking holding company. See the sections captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Capital Requirements\u201d in Item 1, Business, and Note 14, \u201cRegulatory Capital Requirements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for detailed capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks.\nThe Company is a financial holding company, and its sources of funds are limited.\nThe Company is a financial holding company and its operations are primarily conducted by the Bank, which is subject to significant federal and state regulation. Cash available to pay dividends to shareholders of the Company is derived primarily from dividends paid by the Bank. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to receive dividends or loans from its Bank subsidiary is restricted. Under federal law, the payment of dividends by the Bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements. The Federal Reserve Board and/or the FDIC prohibit a dividend payment by the Company or the Bank that would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. See the sections captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Limit on Dividends\u201d in Item 1, Business, and Note 14, \u201cRegulatory Capital Requirements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe inability of the Bank to generate profits and pay such dividends to the Company, or regulator restrictions on the payment of such dividends to the Company even if earned, would have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nIn addition, since the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, its right to participate in the distribution of assets of the Bank upon the Bank\u2019s liquidation, reorganization or otherwise will be subject to the prior claims of the Bank\u2019s creditors, which will generally take priority over the Bank\u2019s shareholders.\nRisks Associated With Our Common Stock\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies.\nShares of our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on December 7, 2017 under the symbol \u201cMVBF,\u201d and were previously traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. There has been limited trading in our shares over the last 12 months. If limited trading in the common stock continues, it may be difficult for investors to sell such shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. Also, the sale of a large block of common stock could depress the market price of the common stock to a greater degree than a company that typically has a higher volume of trading of its securities.\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements, our stock could be delisted, and the trading price, volume and marketability of our stock could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 7, 2017, our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Previously, our common stock was traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to maintain compliance with\nNasdaq\u2019s present listing standards, or that Nasdaq will not implement additional listing standards with which we will be unable to comply. Failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements could result in the delisting of our shares from trading on the Nasdaq system, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price, volume and marketability of our common stock.\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u2022perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022changes in government regulations; and\n\u2022geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the economies we serve; industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions; interest rate changes, oil price volatility or credit loss trends could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nOur ability to pay dividends is not certain and we may be unable to pay future dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be your sole opportunity for gains on your investment for the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to pay dividends in the future is not certain. Any future determination relating to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, regulatory restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, and if declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. As part of our consideration of whether to pay cash dividends, we intend to retain adequate funds from future earnings to support the development and growth of our business. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is restricted by federal policies and regulations and by the terms of our existing indebtedness. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs and financial condition. For further information, see the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Limit on Dividends\u201d in Item 1, Business, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nWe are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. At December 31, 2019, we have no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting but a material weakness could occur in the future. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a control deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. If we fail to maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that meets the requirements of Section 404, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. Additionally, failure to comply with Section 404 or the report by us of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may be adversely affected. If we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may not have access to the capital markets, and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe value of the securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in securities\nmarkets.\nDue to credit and liquidity risks and economic volatility, making the determination of the value of a securities portfolio is less certain. A decline in market value associated with these disruptions could result in other-than-temporary or permanent impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges which could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and estimates are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and any changes to such accounting policies and estimates could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting policies and estimates are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management makes judgments and assumptions in selecting and adopting various accounting policies and in applying estimates so that such policies and estimates comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nManagement has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability or reducing a liability. Because of the uncertainty surrounding our judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, actual outcomes may be materially different from amounts previously estimated. For example, because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates, the Bank could need to significantly increase its allowance for loan losses if actual losses are more than the amount reserved. Any increase in its allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior financial statements. See the section captioned \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses\u201d in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nFurther, from time to time, the FASB and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. The ongoing economic recession has resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by legislators and our regulators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles. In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models which may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate which could result in unexpected losses, insufficient allowances for loan losses, or unexpected fluctuations in the value of our financial instruments.\nThe processes we use to estimate our inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models we use for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models we use for determining our probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17151, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MVBF"}
