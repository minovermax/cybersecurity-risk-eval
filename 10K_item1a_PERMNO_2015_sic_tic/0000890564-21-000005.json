{"cik": "890564", "company": "ASGN Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to, the following:\nProfitability and Operational Risks\nThe continuing impacts of COVID-19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and may have an adverse effect on our business, operations and our future financial performance.\nThe economic disruptions caused by the global health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, operations and future financial performance. Among other things, our financial performance for 2020 was adversely affected by lower demand in our commercial business. There continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial and operating results in future periods.\nThe impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and future financial performance could include, but are not limited to, adverse impacts to our operating income, operating margin, net income, earnings per share and operating cash flows, as expenses may not decrease at the same rate as revenues decline. In addition, our quarterly and annual revenue growth rates and expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical rates, and our future operating results may fall below expectations. The pandemic may also have an effect on our customers' ability to make required payments and, as a result, we may experience an increase in accounts receivable days sales outstanding and credit losses.\nIf we are not able to remain competitive in obtaining and retaining clients, our future growth will suffer. Many of our agreements may be terminated by clients at will and the termination of a significant number of such agreements would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nThe professional staffing and consulting services industry is highly competitive and fragmented with limited barriers to entry. We compete in national, regional and local markets with full-service agencies and in regional and local markets with specialized contract staffing agencies and consulting businesses. The success of our business depends upon our ability to continually secure new orders from clients and to fill those orders with our contract professionals.\nMost of our agreements with clients do not provide for exclusive use of our services, many of our agreements may be terminated at will and, in some instances, we provide services without entering into contracts. As such, clients are free to place orders with our competitors. If clients terminate a significant number of our staffing and consulting agreements or do not use us for future assignments and we are unable to generate new work to replace lost revenues, the growth of our business could be adversely affected and our revenues and results of operations could be harmed. As a result, it is imperative to our business that we maintain positive relationships with our clients. We are expanding our light deliverables-based professional services model whereby we perform certain project oversight functions. If we are not able to comply with these performance requirements, our revenues and relationships with our clients may be adversely affected.\nTo the extent that competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices or increasing marketing expenditures, we could lose revenues and our margins could decline, which could harm our operating results and cause the trading price of our stock to decline. We expect competition for clients to increase in the future, and the success and growth of our business depends on our ability to remain competitive. In addition, we participate in a number of third-party contracts as a subcontractor and that requires us to participate in vendor management contracts, which may subject us to greater risks or lower margins.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified contract professionals, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business is substantially dependent upon our ability to attract and retain contract professionals who possess the skills, experience and licenses which may be required to meet the specified requirements of our clients. We compete for such contract professionals with other temporary staffing and consulting companies and with our clients and potential clients. There can be no assurance that qualified professionals will be available to us in adequate numbers to staff our temporary assignments. Moreover, our contract professionals are often hired to become regular employees of our clients and their employment is terminable at will. Attracting and retaining contract professionals depends on several factors, including our ability to provide contract professionals with desirable assignments and competitive wages and benefits. The cost of attracting and retaining contract professionals in the future may be higher than we anticipate if there is an increase in competitive wages and benefits and, as a result, if we are unable to pass these costs on to our clients, our likelihood of achieving or maintaining profitability could decline. In periods of low unemployment, there may be a shortage of and significant competition for, the skilled contract professionals sought by our clients. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of contract professionals to meet client demand, we may be required to forgo revenue opportunities, which may hurt the growth of our business. In periods of high unemployment, contract professionals frequently opt for full-time employment directly with clients and, due to a large pool of available candidates, clients are able to directly hire and recruit qualified candidates without the involvement of staffing agencies.\nWe utilize several subcontractor firms who employ individuals with the H-1B visa classification. The H-1B visa classification is subject to legislative and administrative changes, as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement. Immigration laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political developments and levels of economic activity. Current and future restrictions on the availability of such visas could limit our subcontractors\u2019 ability to employ and/or retain the skilled professionals we need to meet our clients\u2019 needs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf we are unable to meet our expectations for growth, our future results are likely to be adversely affected.\nOver the past several years, we have experienced revenue and earnings growth both organically and through acquisitions, though this growth was dampened in 2020 due to the global pandemic. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue this pace of growth in the future or meet our strategic objectives for growth. Our growth could be adversely affected by many factors, including future technology industry conditions, macroeconomic events such as the recent global pandemic, competition and labor market trends or regulations. If our growth rate slows, or if it fails to grow at the pace anticipated and we are unable to be successful in our growth initiatives and strategies, our financial results could be less than our expectations or those of investors or analysts and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy also includes continuing efforts to integrate and optimize our organization, programs, technology and delivery of services to make us a more agile and effective competitor, to reduce the cost of operating our business and to increase our operating profit and operating profit margin. We may not be successful in our continuing integration and optimization efforts, and they may fail to achieve the cost savings we anticipate or limit our ability to scale growth. Further, we may fail to prevent the return of costs eliminated in these efforts. If we are not successful in implementing our integration and optimization efforts, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA loss or reduction in revenues from one or more large client accounts could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nDuring 2020, revenue from various organizations within the U.S. federal government were approximately 23.5 percent of consolidated revenues, and no other client represented more than 10 percent of revenues. All of our government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. Further, our large commercial clients may enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several staffing firms and the client is generally able to terminate our contracts on short notice without penalty. The deterioration of the financial condition or business prospects of these large clients, or a change in their strategy around the use of our services, could reduce their need for our services and result in a significant decrease in the revenues and earnings we derive from them. The loss of one or more of our large national or multinational clients, or a significant decrease in their demand for our services, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may not successfully make or integrate acquisitions, which could harm our business and growth.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have made numerous acquisitions, and we intend to continue to pursue selected acquisitions in the future. We compete with other companies in the professional staffing and consulting industries for acquisition opportunities and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or be able to complete future acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. There also can be no assurance that we will realize the benefits expected from any transaction or receive a favorable return on investment from our acquisitions.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to finance our acquisitions, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. The incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased interest expense and could include additional covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions, which could result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by investors, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe integration of an acquisition involves a number of factors that may affect our operations. These factors include diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, difficulties or delay in the integration of acquired operations, retention of key personnel, entry into unfamiliar markets, significant unanticipated costs or legal liabilities and tax and accounting issues. If we fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, we may incur tax and accounting changes. Furthermore, once we have integrated an acquired business, the business may not achieve anticipated levels of revenue, profitability or productivity, or otherwise perform as expected. Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with the terms of our debt agreements could affect our operating flexibility.\nOur outstanding debt at December 31, 2020 included a term loan of $490.8 million under our senior secured credit facility and $550.0 million of 4.625 percent unsecured senior notes due 2028. Our term loan has a variable interest rate, making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates. Additionally, we use a portion of our cash flow from operations for interest payments on our debt rather than for our operations.\nOur failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the requirement to repay such borrowings before their due date. Some covenants are tied to our operating results and thus may be breached if we do not perform as expected. Further, the terms of our senior credit facility permit additional borrowings, subject to certain conditions. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify.\nWe expect to use cash on hand and cash flows from operations to pay our expenses and repay our debt. Our ability to pay our expenses thus depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. If we do not have enough money, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets or borrow additional funds. We may not be able to take such actions on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. The lenders may require fees and expenses to be paid or other changes to terms in connection with waivers or amendments. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and/or rates.\nWe derive significant revenues from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. Our revenues and profitability may be adversely impacted if we fail to compete effectively in such processes.\nOur contracts and task orders with the federal government are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process, which creates significant competition and pricing pressure. We spend time and resources to prepare bids and proposals for contracts. Some of these contracts may not be awarded to us or, if awarded, we may not receive meaningful task orders under these contracts. We may encounter delays and additional expenses if our competitors protest or challenge contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract. If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to customers services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nOur earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate and manage costs, time and resources.\nOur ECS segment generates revenues under various types of contracts: firm-fixed-price, cost reimbursable and time and materials. Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract, the costs incurred in their performance and the nature of services or solutions provided. Under firm-fixed-price contracts, we perform specific tasks and services for a fixed price. Compared with cost reimbursable, firm-fixed-price contracts generally offer higher margin opportunities, but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns. When making proposals on firm-fixed-price contracts, we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the associated projects. Failure to accurately estimate costs, resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during the performance of work could result in reduced profits or in losses. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs plus a profit margin or fee. These contracts generally have lower profitability and less financial risk. Under time and materials contracts, we are reimbursed for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. We assume financial risk on time and materials contracts because we assume the risk of performing those contracts at negotiated hourly rates.\nWe may not realize the full value of our ECS segment contract backlog, which may result in lower revenues than anticipated.\nContract backlog, which was $2.6 billion at December 31, 2020, is a useful measure of potential future revenues for our ECS segment. Our ECS segment contract backlog consists of contracts for which funding has been formally awarded (funded backlog) and unfunded backlog, which represents the estimated future revenues to be earned from negotiated contract awards for which funding has not been awarded and from unexercised contract options.\nThe U.S. government's ability to elect to not exercise contract options or to modify, curtail or terminate our contracts makes the calculation of our ECS segment contract backlog subject to numerous uncertainties. Due to the uncertain nature of our contracts with the U.S. government, we may never realize revenue from some of the engagements that are included in our contract backlog. Our unfunded backlog, in particular, contains amounts that we may never realize as revenue because the maximum contract value specified under a U.S. government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract.\nAn impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets could require a write down that materially and adversely affects our results of operations and net worth.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of goodwill and $487.9 million of net acquired intangible assets. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (consisting entirely of trademarks) for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets having finite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We may be required to record a charge, which could be material, in our financial statements during the period in which we determine an impairment has occurred. Impairment charges could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the periods that such charges are recorded.\nRisks Related to Government Contracts\nA significant loss or suspension of our facility security clearances with the federal government could lead to a reduction in our revenues, cash flows and operating results.\nWe act as a contractor and a subcontractor to the U.S. federal government and many of its agencies. Some government contracts require us to maintain facility security clearances and require some of our employees to maintain individual security clearances. If our employees lose or are unable to timely obtain security clearances, or we lose a facility clearance, a government agency client may terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration. In addition, a security breach by us could cause serious harm to our business, damage our reputation and prevent us from being eligible for further work on sensitive or classified systems for federal government clients.\nWe are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations related to government contracts, some of which are complex, and our failure to comply could result in fines or civil or criminal penalties, or suspension or debarment, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our federal government customers. Such laws and regulations may potentially impose added costs on our business and our failure to comply with them may lead to civil or criminal penalties, termination of our U.S. government contracts and/or suspension or debarment from contracting with U.S. government agencies. All of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source and could damage our reputation and impair our ability to compete for future contracts. Failure to comply with regulations and required practices and procedures could harm our reputation or influence the award of new contracts.\nChanges in U.S. government spending or budgetary priorities, the failure of government budgets to be approved on a timely basis, or delays in contract awards and other procurement activity may significantly and adversely affect our future financial results.\nOur business depends upon continued U.S. government expenditures on intelligence, defense, homeland security, federal health IT and other programs that we support. The U.S. government conducts periodic reviews of U.S. defense strategies and priorities which may shift Department of Defense budgetary priorities, reduce overall spending, or delay contract or task order awards for defense-related programs from which we would otherwise expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues. Any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or contract renewals. Any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement. Our revenues, cash flows and operating results could be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in budgetary priorities, as well as by delays in the government budget process, program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts.\nAudits by U.S. government agencies for contracts with federal government clients could result in unfavorable audit results that could subject us to a variety of penalties and sanctions and could harm our reputation and relationships with our customers and adversely impact results of operations.\nFederal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors\u2019 administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. If a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies.\nCybersecurity and Technology Risks\nThe failure to prevent a cybersecurity incident affecting our systems could result in the disruption of our services or the disclosure or misuse of sensitive information, which could harm our reputation, decrease demand for our services and products, expose us to liability, penalties and remedial costs, or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur daily business operations depend on our information technology systems for a wide variety of functions, including, among other things, identifying staffing resources, matching personnel with client assignments and managing our accounting and financial reporting functions. In conducting our business, we routinely collect and retain personal information on these systems about our employees and contract professionals and their dependents including, without limitation, full names, social security numbers, addresses, birth dates and payroll-related information.\nAny information-technology systems are at risk of being compromised, whether through malicious activity or human or technological error. Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our information security technologies, and we have implemented security controls to help protect the security and privacy of our business information, our information technology systems are subject to potential security breaches through third-party service providers, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, business email compromise\nand cybersecurity threats, including denial of service attacks, viruses, ransomware or other malicious software programs, and third parties gaining unauthorized access to our information technology systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. We are continuously exposed to unauthorized attempts to compromise such sensitive information through cyber-attacks, insider threats and other information security threats, including physical break-ins and malicious insiders, and we have, from time to time, experienced security incidents. For example, in November 2020, one of our divisions experienced a network intrusion resulting in the compromise of former employee information for that division. We incurred costs relating to this event, including costs to retain third-party consultants and forensic experts to investigate the attack and assist with remediation. We also invested in tightening security of our information technology infrastructure, systems and network. The incident did not have a material impact on our business, operations or financial results.\nAny security incident that results in the compromise of personal information we collect and retain, or that otherwise disrupts or negatively impacts our operations, could harm our reputation, lead to customer attrition, and expose us to regulatory enforcement action or litigation. Because the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate security measures to prevent security breaches. In addition, our information technology systems are vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, computer and network failures, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, terrorist attacks and similar events. All of these risks are also applicable wherever we rely on outside vendors to provide services.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected if we cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of our services.\nOur success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of our services. We rely on a variety of technologies to support important functions in our business, including the recruitment, placement and monitoring of our contract professionals, our billings, and candidate and client data analytics. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, such as emerging job and resume posting services, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve our business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, our services, results of operations and ability to develop and maintain our business could be adversely affected.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nSignificant legal actions and claims could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities, result in damage to our business reputation, result in the discontinuation of our client relationships and adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts.\nWe employ people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses. Our ability to control or influence the workplace environment of our clients is limited. Further, many of the individuals that we place with our clients have access to client information systems and confidential information. As the employer of record of our contract professionals, we incur a risk of liability to our contract professionals for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. Other inherent risks include possible claims of errors and omissions; intentional misconduct; release, misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property; criminal activity; torts; or other claims. We also have been subject to legal actions alleging vicarious liability, negligent hiring, discrimination, sexual harassment, retroactive entitlement to employee benefits, violation of wage and hour requirements, retaliation and related legal theories. These types of actions could involve large claims and significant defense costs. We may be subject to liability in such cases even if the contribution to the alleged injury was minimal. Moreover, in most instances, we are required to indemnify clients against some or all of these risks and we could be required to pay substantial sums to fulfill our indemnification obligations. In addition, we may need to indemnify our clients against losses in the event that the client is determined to be non-compliant with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \"ACA\") due to a joint employer claim.\nA failure of any of our employees internally, or contract professionals in client's workplaces, to observe our policies and guidelines intended to reduce these risks could result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, payment of monetary damages or fines, or other material adverse impacts on our business. Claims raised by clients stemming from the improper actions of our contract professionals, even if without merit, could cause us to incur significant expense associated with the costs or damages related to such claims. Further, such claims by clients could damage our business reputation and result in the discontinuation of client relationships. Any associated negative publicity could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified contract professionals in the future.\nWe proactively address many of these issues with our robust compliance program. Further, to protect ourselves from the costs and damages of significant legal actions and claims, we maintain workers\u2019 compensation, errors and omissions, employment practices and general liability insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations. Our insurance policies include a retention amount and may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. In addition, we face various employment-related risks not covered by insurance, such as wage and hour laws and employment tax responsibility. If we do not maintain adequate insurance coverage or are made party to significant uninsured claims, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to government regulation, which in the future could restrict the types of employment services we are permitted to offer or result in additional or increased costs that reduce our revenues and earnings.\nThe professional staffing and IT services industry is regulated in the United States and other countries in which we operate. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the employer/employee relationship, such as those related to payment of federal, state and local payroll and unemployment taxes for our corporate employees and contractor professional employees, tax withholding, social security or retirement benefits, licensing, wage and hour requirements, paid sick leave, paid family leave and other leaves, employee benefits, pay equity, non-discrimination, sexual harassment and workers\u2019 compensation; and we must further comply with immigration laws and a wide variety of notice and administrative requirements, such as record keeping, written contracts and reporting. We are also subject to U.S. laws and regulations relating to government contracts with federal agencies, as well as the requirements of the ACA. In certain other countries, we may not be considered the legal employers of our temporary personnel, however we are still responsible for collecting taxes and social security deductions and transmitting these amounts to the taxing authorities.\nIn addition, we are subject to data privacy, protection and security laws and regulations, the most significant of which is the European General Data Protection Act (\"GDPR\") that governs the personal information of European persons, which we may collect, use and retain in the ordinary course of our business. This law impacts our U.S. operations as well as our European operations as it applies not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries. The GDPR imposes more stringent compliance and operational requirements for entities processing personal information that is potentially confidential and/or personally identifiable and sensitive, such as stronger safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the European Union and stronger enforcement authorities and mechanisms. Certain U.S. states have also enacted laws requiring security measures that are broadly similar to GDPR requirements, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, and we expect that other states will continue to do so. Any inadvertent non-compliance of the GDPR or other data privacy laws could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect our operations and reputation.\nFuture changes in the laws or governmental regulations affecting our business may result in the prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services that we are permitted to offer, or the imposition of new or additional compliance requirements that could increase our costs and reduce our revenues and earnings. Due to the substantial number of state and local jurisdictions in which we operate, there also is a risk that we may be unable to adequately monitor actual or proposed changes in, or the interpretation of, the laws or governmental regulations of such states and localities. Any delay in our compliance with changes in such laws or governmental regulations could result in potential fines, penalties, or other sanctions for non-compliance. In addition, although we may elect to bill some or all of any additional costs to our customers, there can be no assurances that we will be able to increase the fees charged to our customers in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to fully cover any increased costs as a result of future changes in laws or government regulations.\nOur business may be materially affected by changes to fiscal and tax policies that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to taxation in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes made by the current administration in the United States and in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or by changes in the tax laws or their interpretation.\nVarious levels of government also are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. Further changes in tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe are subject to various business, regulatory and currency risks associated with international operations, which could increase our costs, cause our results of operations to fluctuate and adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct business outside the United States primarily in Canada and Europe, and we have a nearshore delivery center in Mexico. Our international operations, which in the aggregate represented less than five percent of our consolidated revenues in 2020, expose us to, among other things operational, regulatory, political and currency risks in the countries in which we operate.\nGeneral Risks\nU.S. and global market and economic developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for the professional staffing and consulting services that we provide is significantly affected by global market and economic conditions. As economic activity slows, many clients or potential clients reduce their use of and reliance upon contract professionals. During periods of reduced economic activity, we may also be subject to increased competition for market share and pricing pressure. As a result, a recession or periods of reduced economic activity could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe loss of key members of our senior management team could adversely affect the execution of our business strategy and our financial results.\nWe believe that the successful execution of our business strategy and our ability to build upon our business and acquisitions of new businesses depends on the continued employment of key members of our senior management team. We have provided short-term and long-term incentive compensation to our key management in an effort to retain them. However, if members of our senior management team become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we could incur significant costs and experience business disruption related to time spent on efforts to replace them, and our financial results and our business could be adversely affected.\nFailure of internal controls may leave us susceptible to errors and fraud.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, would be detected, particularly in our newly acquired companies and international operations. If our internal controls are unsuccessful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe trading price of our common stock has experienced significant volatility, which may result in losses for investors.\nIn 2020, the trading price of our common stock experienced significant fluctuations, ranging from a high of $86.66 to a low of $31.26. The closing price of our common stock on the NYSE was $94.16 on February 19, 2021. Our common stock may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a large number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to:\n\u2022general economic conditions, slow or negative growth of unrelated markets and other external factors;\n\u2022failure to meet previously announced guidance or analysts\u2019 expectations of our quarterly results;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022commencement of, or involvement in, any significant litigation matter;\n\u2022any major change in our management or Board of Directors (\"Board\");\n\u2022changes in government regulations;\n\u2022recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates;\n\u2022announcements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations;\n\u2022sale or purchase of stock by us or by our stockholders; and\n\u2022short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in shares of our common stock.\nAmong other things, stock-price volatility could mean that investors are not able to sell their shares at or above the prices they paid for the stock. We may encounter difficulty should we desire to access the public markets for financing or use our common stock as consideration in a strategic transaction. Additionally, securities class action litigation can occur following periods of stock-price volatility, which could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur business is subject to disruptions and other risks of health crises, earthquakes, fire, floods and other catastrophic events.\nOur business relies heavily on the health and safety of our employees, contract professionals and customers and the continuity of our business systems. Adverse events, such as harm to our offices, the inability to travel and other matters affecting the regions or economies in which we operate could harm our business. In the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man-made problem, or outbreaks of pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, we may be unable to continue our operations and may experience system interruptions and reputational harm. Acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could also cause disruptions in our business or the business of our clients, vendors, or the economy as a whole. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. Similarly, if our clients are harmed by any of these events, their demand for our services may decrease, which would decrease our revenues and harm our business. A significant disaster or disruption, whether man-made or natural, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control that our stockholders consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the impact of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022Our Board has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy in the Board upon the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board until the next applicable annual meeting of stockholders.\n\u2022Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. Further, our Board is divided into three classes and only one class is up for election each year. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\n\u2022Our Board may issue, without stockholder approval, up to one million shares of undesignated or \"blank check\" preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated or \"blank check\" preferred stock makes it possible for our Board to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt by, or make it more difficult for, a third- party to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under these provisions, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any large stockholders who hold 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting capital stock in a merger or business combination unless the holder has held the stock for three years, the Board has expressly approved the merger or business transaction, or at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting capital stock not owned by such large stockholder approves the merger or the transaction. These provisions of Delaware law may have the impact of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control and may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price. In addition, our Board could rely on these provisions of Delaware law to discourage, prevent, or delay an acquisition of us.", "PERMNO": 77917, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "ASGN"}
