{"cik": "891293", "company": "CTI BIOPHARMA CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The occurrence of any of the risks described below and elsewhere in this document could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, operating results or prospects and the trading price of our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, liquidity, operating results and prospects and the trading price of our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe expect to continue to incur net losses, and we may never achieve profitability.\nWe were incorporated in 1991 and have incurred a net operating loss every year since our formation. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.4 billion, and we expect to continue to incur net losses. As part of our business plan, we will need to successfully commercialize our one product approved for commercialization, VONJO, continue to conduct research, development, testing and regulatory compliance activities with respect to pacritinib for additional indications and ensure the procurement of manufacturing and drug supply services for our commercial and drug development efforts, the costs of which, together with projected general and administrative expenses, is expected to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurances that we will ever achieve profitability.\nWe have not generated any significant revenue from product sales and we may never be profitable.\nWe have one product approved for commercialization, VONJO, but have not generated any significant revenue from product sales. Our ability to generate significant revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with potential strategic collaboration partners, to successfully commercialize VONJO and to complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory and marketing approvals necessary to commercialize pacritinib for other indications. We do not anticipate generating significant revenue from product sales in the near future.\nObtaining regulatory approval requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and without additional financing, we lack sufficient resources to pursue the development of pacritinib. Other than our Credit Agreement, we currently have no commitments or arrangements for any significant additional financing to fund the commercial launch of VONJO or the development of pacritinib for additional indications, and we will need to seek additional funding, which may not be available or may not be available on favorable terms. We could also seek another collaborative partnership for the additional development and commercialization of pacritinib, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. If we further partner pacritinib, we may have to relinquish valuable economic rights and would potentially forgo additional economic benefits that could be realized if we continued the development and commercialization activities alone.\nWe anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing VONJO. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, domestic or foreign, to change our manufacturing processes or assays, or to perform clinical, nonclinical, or other types of post-approval studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Our revenue from sales of VONJO will be dependent, in part, upon market size, the accepted price for the product, the approved indication(s), and the ability to obtain reimbursement at any price. If the number of our addressable patients is not as significant as we estimate or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice, or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of VONJO.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 global pandemic, in regions where third parties on which we rely, such as Clinical Research Organizations, or CROs, have clinical trial sites or other business operations and may result in significant disruptions to our clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business has been adversely affected and may continue to be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the ongoing worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, in regions where we are conducting the PACIFICA Phase 3 trial. The spread of this pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets and may disrupt our business and delay our clinical trials and timelines.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders have been enacted in each of the geographies in which we are conducting our clinical trials and such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could be reinstated, thereby further affecting our clinical trials. The patient populations that are eligible for our clinical trials are immunocompromised and are at higher risk for becoming infected with COVID-19. As COVID-19 affects the parts of the\nworld where we are conducting our clinical trials, and the patients involved with these clinical trials become infected with COVID-19, we may have more adverse events and deaths in our clinical trials as a result.\nWe have faced and may continue to face difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials as the patient populations that are eligible for our clinical trials are impacted by COVID-19. Patient enrollment may be further delayed due to the diversion of healthcare resources, such as hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials, away from the conduct of clinical trials, toward the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdditionally, if our clinical trial patients are unable to travel to our clinical trial sites as a result of quarantines or other restrictions resulting from COVID-19, we may experience higher drop-out rates or delays in our clinical trials. Similarly, we may struggle to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19. Any such delays in enrollment hinder our ability to obtain clinical data on the schedule we currently predict.\nTravel restrictions continue to be implemented throughout the world in an effort to contain COVID-19, and several countries have expanded screenings of travelers.\nWe may experience additional disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic that could severely impact our business and clinical trials, including:\n\u2022delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials, including interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials;\n\u2022changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether;\n\u2022interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others, or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could affect the integrity of clinical trial data;\n\u2022delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees, and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;\n\u2022limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n\u2022refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies; and\n\u2022interruption or delays to our sourced discovery and clinical activities.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 has been ongoing for two years and continues to rapidly evolve. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, any one or a combination of these events could have an adverse effect on the operation of and results from our clinical trials or our general business operations.\nWe face direct and intense competition from our competitors in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may not compete successfully against them.\nCompetition in the oncology market is intense and is accentuated by the rapid pace of technological and product development. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market. Our\ncompetitors in the United States and elsewhere are numerous and include, among others, major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. See \u201cPart I, Item 1, \u201cCompetition\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on our specific competitors. In addition to the specific competitive factors discussed above, new anti-cancer drugs or drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 that may be under development or developed and marketed in the future could compete with our various compounds.\nMany of our competitors, particularly multinational pharmaceutical companies, either alone or together with their collaborators, have substantially greater financial and technical resources and substantially larger development and marketing teams than us, as well as significantly greater experience than we do in developing, commercializing, manufacturing, marketing and selling products. As a result, products of our competitors might come to market sooner or might prove to be more effective, less expensive, have fewer side effects or be easier to administer than ours. In any such case, sales of any potential future product would likely suffer and we might never recoup the significant investments we have made and will continue to make to develop and market these compounds.\nWe have limited experience in generating revenue from product sales.\nOur ability to generate significant revenue from product sales depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaboration partners, to successfully commercialize VONJO and obtain the regulatory and marketing approvals necessary to commercialize pacritinib for other indications. We currently have limited commercialization expertise, including sales, marketing, or distribution capabilities, and VONJO may not remain in the market for a number of reasons, including ineffectiveness, harmful side effects, difficulty in scaling manufacturing, political and legislative changes, or competition from existing future alternatives. Our ability to generate substantial future revenue from product sales depends heavily on our success in many areas, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022developing a sustainable manufacturing process for VONJO and establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can conduct the processes and provide adequate (in amount and quality) product supply to support market demand for VONJO;\n\u2022launching and commercializing VONJO;\n\u2022obtaining market acceptance of VONJO;\n\u2022obtaining adequate market share, reimbursement and pricing for VONJO;\n\u2022our ability to find patients so they can be diagnosed and begin receiving treatment;\n\u2022addressing any competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022negotiating favorable terms, including commercial rights, in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter, any amendments thereto or extensions thereof;\n\u2022maintaining, protecting, and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how; and\n\u2022attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel.\nIf the number of our addressable patients is not as significant as we estimate or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice, or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of VONJO.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements or unanticipated problems with VONJO may result in various adverse actions such as the suspension or withdrawal of VONJO, closure of a facility or enforcement of substantial penalties or fines.\nRegulatory agencies will subject any marketed product(s), as well as the manufacturing facilities, to continual review and periodic inspection. If previously unknown problems with a product or with regulatory requirements are discovered, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, serious or unexpected side effects or other safety risks, problems with a manufacturing process or laboratory facility, or failure to comply with applicable regulatory approval requirements, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions or penalties on that product or on us. Such restrictions or penalties may include, among other things:\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, the withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n\u2022 warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of approvals;\n\u2022product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates; and\n\u2022closure of the facility, enforcement of substantial fines, injunctions, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nWe will need to raise additional funds to operate our business, but additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any inability to raise required capital when needed could harm our liquidity, financial condition, business, operating results and prospects.\nWe have substantial operating expenses associated with the commercialization of VONJO and the development of pacritinib in other indications, and we have significant contractual payment obligations under the debt and lease arrangements. In addition, we believe that our present financial resources will only be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2022. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and we will need to raise substantial additional capital in the near term in order to fund our operations through and beyond the fourth quarter of 2022 and to continue as a going concern thereafter. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our assessment. Uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern could also have a material and adverse impact on the price of our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise sufficient funds for our operations and continue as a going concern. In addition, cash forecasts and capital requirements are subject to change as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties. Developments in and expenses associated with our commercialization activities and with our clinical trials and other research and development activities may consume capital resources earlier than planned. Due to these and other factors, forecasts for any periods in which we indicate that we expect to have sufficient resources to fund our operations, as well as any other operational or business projection we have disclosed, or may disclose, may not be achieved.\nWe will need to acquire additional funds in order to develop our business, continue the commercialization of VONJO and conduct research and development for pacritinib in other indications. We may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity financings, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, disposition of assets, debt financings or restructurings, bank borrowings or other sources of financing. However, our ability to raise capital is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, constraints and consequences. For these and other reasons, additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. If we fail to obtain additional capital when needed, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, reduce our selling, general and administrative expenses, be unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, refrain from making our contractually required payments when due (including debt payments) and/or be forced to cease operations, liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. Any of these consequences could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe are dependent on third-party service providers for a number of critical operational activities. Any failure or delay in these undertakings by third parties could harm our business.\nOur business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under contractual relationships. In particular, we rely heavily on third parties for the manufacture and testing of our compounds. We do not have internal analytical laboratory or manufacturing facilities to allow for the testing or production of our compounds in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. As a result, we rely on third parties to supply us in a timely manner with manufactured products or product candidates in a manner that is compliant with these standards. We may not be able to adequately manage and oversee the manufacturers we choose, they may not perform as agreed or they may terminate their agreements with us. In particular, we depend on third-party manufacturers to conduct their operations in compliance with GLP and cGMP or similar standards imposed by U.S. and/or applicable foreign regulatory authorities, including the FDA and EMA. Any of these regulatory authorities may take action against a contract manufacturer who violates GLP and cGMP. Failure of our manufacturers to comply with FDA, EMA or other applicable regulations may cause us to curtail or stop the manufacture of such products until we obtain regulatory compliance, and could subject us to penalties.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of our compounds if we are unable to secure manufacturers when needed, or if our designated manufacturers do not have the capacity or otherwise fail to manufacture compounds according to our schedule and specifications or fail to comply with cGMP regulations. In particular, in connection with the transition of the manufacturing of drug supply to successor vendors, we could face logistical, scaling or other challenges that may adversely affect supply. Furthermore, in order to maintain applicable regulatory approvals, any manufacturers we utilize are required to consistently produce the respective compounds in commercial quantities and of specified quality or execute fill-finish services on a repeated basis and document their ability to do so, which is referred to as process validation. There are no guarantees we will be able to supply the quantities necessary to effect a successful commercial launch of VONJO or satisfy ongoing demand. Any shortage could also impair our ability to deliver contractually required supply quantities to applicable collaborators, as well as to complete any additional planned clinical trials.\nWe also rely on third-party service providers for certain warehousing, transportation, sales, order processing, distribution and cash collection services. With regard to the distribution of our compounds, we depend on third-party distributors to act in accordance with Good Distribution Practices, or GDP, and the distribution process and facilities are subject to continuing regulation by applicable regulatory authorities with respect to the distribution and storage of products.\nIn addition, we depend on medical institutions and CROs (together with their respective agents) to conduct clinical trials and associated activities in compliance with GCP, and in accordance with our timelines, expectations and requirements. To the extent any such third parties are delayed in achieving or fail to meet our clinical trial enrollment expectations, fail to conduct our trials in accordance with GCP or study protocol or otherwise take actions outside of our control or without our consent, our business may be harmed. Furthermore, we conduct clinical trials in foreign countries, subjecting us to additional risks and challenges, including as a result of the engagement of foreign medical institutions and foreign CROs, who may be less experienced with regard to regulatory matters applicable to us and may have different standards of medical care.\nWith regard to certain of the foregoing clinical trial operations and stages in the manufacturing and distribution chain of our compounds, we rely on single vendors. We only have one commercial supplier of VONJO. The use of single vendors for core operational activities, such as clinical trial operations, manufacturing and distribution, and the resulting lack of diversification, exposes us to the risk of a material interruption in service related to these single, outside vendors. As a result, our exposure to this concentration risk could harm our business.\nMany of our vendors process personal data on our behalf which is subject to the GDPR, or governed by US State laws regarding data breach (e.g., the New York Shield Act or the California Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d)). Failure of our vendors to adequately secure that data may result in exposure to us, as controller for that data, under the GDPR or any of the US State laws in the form of legal costs associated with investigation, notification, and reporting of such a breach, and any resulting fines or penalties. Any breach of the security or other significant disruptions to our information technology systems or those of our vendors could have significant implications for our ability to continually operate our business, and may cause reputational harm. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, such insurance may not cover the full extent of any financial, legal, reputational or business losses associated with any breach or disruption including any vendor systems processing our data.\nWe are party to a loan and security agreement that contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and we may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness in an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn August 2021, we entered into a credit agreement with Drug Royalty III LP 2 (\u201cDRI\u201d), the proceeds of which were partially used to repay in full all outstanding indebtedness under our prior loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.\nBorrowings under this credit agreement are secured by a first-priority security interest in, subject to certain exceptions, substantially all of our assets. The credit agreement subjects us to customary affirmative and negative covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, grant liens, make investments, incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, license certain property, distribute dividends, make certain restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates and insiders, prepay other indebtedness, or engage in sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the credit agreement contains a minimum liquidity covenant requiring us to maintain at all times at least $10 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, subject to certain exceptions. As a result of all of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities or unable to execute our business strategy.\nA breach of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in an event of default under the credit agreement. With respect to the audited financial statements as of December 31, 2021, we were unable to satisfy the affirmative covenant in the credit agreement requiring us to deliver to DRI within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, audited financial statements of the Company accompanied by an unqualified report and opinion of an independent certified public accountant not subject to any \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification or exception. We have obtained a waiver of breach of such covenant from DRI since the report of independent registered public accounting firm contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K states that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf any other event of default occurs and is not cured or waived, DRI would be permitted to accelerate the loans under the credit agreement. If we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the credit agreement upon acceleration, DRI could proceed against the collateral securing the credit agreement which could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we are unable to recruit, retain, integrate and motivate senior management, other key personnel and directors, or if such persons are unable to perform effectively, our business could suffer.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain senior management, other key personnel and directors to enable the execution of our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of our operations are dependent on our ability to integrate and train our new personnel quickly and effectively.\nIf we are unable to continue to provide directors and officers sufficient liability insurance at affordable rates or at all, or if directors and officers perceive our ability to do so in the future to be limited, it may become increasingly more difficult to attract and retain management and qualified directors to serve on our Board of Directors.\nThe loss of the services of senior management, other key personnel or directors and/or the inability to timely attract or integrate such persons could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our expected growth and in expanding our operations successfully.\nAdvancing VONJO through the commercialization process has required, and will continue to require us to develop or expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, medical affairs, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. Maintaining additional relationships and managing our future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management. We must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively, hire, train and integrate additional management, development, medical affairs, administrative and sales and marketing personnel, improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, and expand our facilities, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. Our future financial performance will depend, in part, on our ability to manage this growth effectively. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks; which failure could prevent us from successfully commercializing VONJO.\nIf we are unable to in-license or acquire additional product candidates, our future product portfolio and potential profitability could be harmed.\nOne component of our business strategy is the in-licensing and acquisition of drug compounds developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or academic research laboratories, such as pacritinib. Competition for new promising compounds and commercial products can be intense. If we are not able to identify future in-licensing or acquisition opportunities and enter into arrangements on acceptable terms, our future product portfolio and potential profitability could be harmed.\nWe may owe additional amounts for VAT related to our operations in Europe.\nOur European operations are subject to the Value Added Tax, or VAT, which is usually applied to all goods and services purchased and sold throughout Europe. We historically carried out research and development activities in Italy and incurred value added tax, or VAT, from Italian suppliers on the acquisition of goods and services in Italy. This VAT should be considered as an input VAT credit. We treated the majority of our sales made in Italy without output VAT (on the basis that the supplies should be considered outside the scope of Italian VAT). This resulted in the value of input VAT exceeding the value of output VAT, and accordingly we submitted a refund claim for the VAT. The Italian Tax Authority, or the ITA, has challenged\nthe treatment of the sales transactions and claimed that the sales transactions made by us should have been subject to output VAT.\nFurther information pertaining to these cases can be found in Part II, Item 8, \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and is incorporated by reference herein. If the final decision of the Italian Supreme Court is unfavorable to us, or if, in the interim, the ITA were to make a demand for payment and we were to be unsuccessful in suspending collection efforts, we may be requested to pay to the ITA an amount up to \u20ac4.4 million, or approximately $4.9 million converted using the currency exchange rate as of December 31, 2021, including interest and penalties for the period lapsed between the date in which the assessments were issued and the date of effective payment.\nWe are currently subject to certain regulatory and legal proceedings, and may in the future be subject to additional proceedings and/or allegations of wrong-doing, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory matters and legal claims, including possible securities, derivative, consumer protection and other types of proceedings pursued by individuals, entities or regulatory bodies. See Part II, Item 8, \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d regarding the regulatory matters and legal claims in which we are currently involved. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and we have had and may in the future have unfavorable rulings and settlements. Adverse outcomes may result in significant monetary damages and penalties or injunctive relief against us. It is possible that our financial condition and operating results could be harmed in any period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any of the legal proceedings we are or may be subject to, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be harmed. The ultimate outcome of litigation and other claims is subject to inherent uncertainties, and our view of these matters may change in the future.\nIn addition, our insurance is subject to high deductibles and there is no guarantee that the insurance will cover any specific claim that we currently face or may face in the future, or that it will be adequate to cover all potential liabilities and damages. In the event of negative publicity resulting from allegations of wrong-doing and/or an adverse outcome under any currently pending or future lawsuit, our business could be materially harmed.\nOur net operating losses may not be available to reduce future income tax liability.\nWe have substantial tax loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but our ability to use such carryforwards to offset future income or tax liability is limited under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as a result of prior changes in the stock ownership of our company. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or other pre-change tax attributes, to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations. Moreover, future changes in the ownership of our stock, including those resulting from issuance of shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants, may further limit our ability to use our net operating losses.\nWe could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. We use significant judgment in evaluating our worldwide income-tax provision. During the ordinary course of business, we conduct many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income-tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nWe may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, both internationally and domestically, governing the use, manufacture, storage, handlings, treatment, transportation and disposal of such materials and certain waste products and employee safety and health matters. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability not covered by insurance could exceed our resources.\nIf we or the third parties upon whom we depend are adversely affected by natural disasters or other events, our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from such interruptions.\nOur headquarters are located in Seattle, Washington. Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, tsunami, extreme weather condition, power shortage, power outage, telecommunication failure, or other natural or man-made accidents or incidents could disrupt our operations. If a natural disaster or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for all losses that may occur. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may not be adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of a natural disaster or other event, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, and we could potentially lose valuable data and other items. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will incur a variety of costs for, and may never realize the anticipated benefits of, acquisitions, collaborations or other strategic transactions.\nWe evaluate and undertake acquisitions, collaborations and other strategic transactions from time to time. The process of negotiating these transactions, as well as integrating any acquisitions and implementing any strategic alliances, may result in operating difficulties and expenditures. In addition, these transactions may require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business, whether or not any such transaction is ever consummated. These undertakings could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and we may never realize the anticipated benefits.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nIf the market opportunities for VONJO are smaller than we believe they are, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.\nOur projections of both the number of patients with myelofibrosis, including patients with myelofibrosis with a platelet count below 50 x 109/L who have the potential to benefit from treatment with VONJO are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources and may prove to be incorrect or new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence, and the number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for VONJO may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with VONJO, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or access, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. Even if we obtain significant market share for VONJO, because the potential target populations are small, we may never become or remain profitable nor generate sufficient revenue growth to sustain our business.\nThe commercial success of any current or future product will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.\nEven with the requisite approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the commercial success of VONJO and any future products will depend in part on the medical community, patients, and payors accepting VONJO and any future products as medically useful, cost-effective, and safe. Any product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, payors, and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of VONJO and any future products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the efficacy of the product as demonstrated in clinical studies and potential advantages over competing treatments;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022the clinical indications for which accelerated approval is granted;\n\u2022relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022the cost of treatment, particularly in relation to competing treatments;\n\u2022the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our field forces and marketing efforts;\n\u2022the strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u2022sufficient third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in nonclinical and clinical studies, market acceptance of the product will not be fully known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate the medical community and payors on the benefits of VONJO require significant resources and may never be successful. If VONJO and any future products fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients, payors, and others in the medical community, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become or remain profitable.\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for VONJO or any future products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nOur target patient populations are small, and accordingly the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of VONJO and other product candidates, if approved, must be adequate to support our commercial infrastructure. Our per-patient prices must be sufficient to recover our development and manufacturing costs and potentially achieve profitability. The cost of a single administration of VONJO is deemed substantial. Accordingly, the availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by governmental and private payors are essential for most patients to afford expensive treatments such as ours. Sales of VONJO will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which their costs will be paid for by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government authorities, private health insurers, and other payors. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, are available only to limited levels, or are not available on a timely basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize VONJO. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to sustain our overall enterprise.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, decides whether and to what extent a new drug will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow the coverage reimbursement policies established by CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS or private payors will decide with respect to reimbursement for a product such as ours.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries will put pressure on the pricing and usage of VONJO and other product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicinal products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for VONJO. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for VONJO may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for VONJO. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of VONJO due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, additional legislative changes, and statements by elected officials. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and with respect to prescription drugs, surgical procedures, and other treatments in particular, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.\nWe may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive, or the trials are not well-designed.\nRegulatory agencies, IRBs or data safety monitoring boards may at any time recommend the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP or other applicable foreign regulatory authority guidelines. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced in accordance with applicable cGMPs. Clinical trial data may be rejected by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or clinical trials may be suspended by the FDA, foreign regulatory authorities, or us for various reasons.\nIf we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate a clinical trial of any of our current or future product candidates, the commercial prospects for that product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from that product may be delayed or eliminated. Furthermore, any of these events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates and impair our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our collaboration partners.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\nThe sale of VONJO and the use of pacritinib in clinical trials expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling VONJO, or clinical trial participants. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcomes of such claims, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 decreased demand for VONJO;\n\u2022 impairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022 costs of litigation;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; and\n\u2022 loss of revenues.\nOur insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses.\nWe are subject to extensive post-approval or authorization regulatory requirements, and any failure to satisfy such ongoing obligations or unanticipated problems with any of our drugs that receive regulatory authorization could negatively affect our business.\nWe are and will continue to be subject to numerous regulatory requirements, including with respect to development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, reporting, sales, and reimbursement for VONJO. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with any of our drugs that receive regulatory authorization, it may result in, among other things:\n\u2022Regulatory authorities may also impose new restrictions on continued product marketing or may require the withdrawal of a product from the market if adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency are discovered following approval;\n\u2022Clinical holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022Warning or untitled letters from the FDA;\n\u2022Refusal by the FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory authority to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of drug license approvals;\n\u2022Drug seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of drugs; and\n\u2022Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nAny of these events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects, generate negative publicity, and require us to expend significant time and resources.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for non-FDA-approved, or off-label, uses.\nOur business and future growth depend on the development, ultimate sale and use of products that are subject to FDA, EMA and or other regulatory agencies regulation, clearance and approval. Under the FDCA and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses, or uses not approved by the FDA. We may also be subject to various federal and state physician payment transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act. This means that in the United States, we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the uses of our products that are not approved by the FDA, unless otherwise allowed by the FDA by policy or other guidance.\nIf our promotional activities are found to be in violation of applicable law or if we agree to a settlement in connection with an enforcement action, we would likely face significant fines and penalties and would likely be required to substantially change our sales, promotion, grant and educational activities.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations related to health care fraud and abuse, false claims, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and the FCPA, in which violations of these laws could result in substantial penalties and prosecution.\nIn the United States, we are subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. There are similar laws in other countries. These laws may impact, among other things, the sales, marketing and education programs for our products. Any allegation, investigation, or violation of these domestic health care fraud and abuse laws could result in government or internal investigations, significant diversion of resources, exclusion from government health care reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, significant fines, penalties, or other financial consequences, any of which may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor our sales and operations outside the United States, we are similarly subject to various heavily-enforced anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA, as amended, U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws around the world. We face significant risks if we, which includes our third parties, fail to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.\nWe leverage various third parties to sell our products and conduct our business abroad. We, our commercial partners and our other third-party intermediaries, including collaborators and licensees, may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, collaborators, licensees and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nAny violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action or related investigation may result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nIf development and commercialization collaborations we enter into are not successful, or if we are unable to enter into additional collaborations, we may not be able to effectively develop and/or commercialize our compounds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, we have entered into development and commercialization collaborations to help advance the development of our product candidates. We evaluate collaboration opportunities from time to time and if we enter into such collaborations in the future, our business may become increasingly dependent on the success of such collaborations. Additionally, if we do not successfully enter into additional collaborations when needed, we may be unable to further develop and commercialize the applicable compounds, generate revenues to sustain or grow our business or achieve profitability, which would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nOur employees, collaborators and other personnel may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, collaborators, vendors, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA, EMA and other regulators, providing inaccurate or misleading information to the FDA, EMA and other regulators, failure to comply with data privacy and security and healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, reporting inaccurate financial information or clinical data or failing to disclose unauthorized activities to us.\nVarious laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Any misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, officers, directors, agents and representatives, including consultants, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws and regulations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf any of our license agreements for intellectual property underlying our product candidates are terminated, we may lose the right to develop or market that product candidate.\nWe have acquired or licensed intellectual property from third parties, including patent applications and patents relating to VONJO. Some of our product development programs depend on our ability to maintain rights under license agreements relating to this licensed intellectual property. Each licensor of this intellectual property has the power to terminate its agreement with us if we fail to meet our obligations under that agreement. If we default under any of these agreements, we may lose our right to market and sell any products based on the intellectual property licensed under these agreements and may be forced to cease operations, liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. Bankruptcy may result in the termination of these agreements.\nWe hold rights under numerous patents that we have acquired or licensed or that protect inventions originating from our research and development, and the expiration of any of these patents would enable our competitors to use the inventions that are the subject of such patents in competition with us.\nWe dedicate significant resources to protecting our intellectual property, which is important to our business. We have filed numerous patent applications in the United States and various other countries seeking protection of inventions originating from our research and development, and we have also obtained rights to various patents and patent applications under licenses with third parties and through acquisitions. We have pending patent applications or issued patents in the United States and foreign countries directed to VONJO and other product candidates. Patent coverage for our individual products extends for varying periods according to the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where we have obtained patent protection.\nIn addition to our patent rights, we rely, to the extent possible, trade secret and contractual protections for our know-how and other unpatented technology. Ultimately, to the extent any of our product candidates are not protected by patent rights our competitors would be free to use inventions embodied in our product candidates to which they have access to compete with us.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position and the potential for long-term success could be harmed.\nDevelopment and protection of our intellectual property are critical to our business. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to practice our technologies, including the inventions embodied in our product candidates.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, has not established a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that it will allow in pharmaceutical and biotechnology patents. Patent applications in which we have rights may never issue as patents, and the claims of any issued patents may not afford meaningful protection for our product candidates or technologies. In addition, patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged and subsequently narrowed, invalidated, circumvented or found unenforceable. Litigation, interference or derivation proceedings or other governmental proceedings that we may become involved in with respect to our patent rights or our proprietary technologies or the proprietary technologies of others could result in substantial cost to us.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to enable us to remain competitive. Third parties may independently develop such know-how or innovations or otherwise obtain access to such know-how or technology. While we require our employees, consultants, corporate partners and other third parties with access to our proprietary information to enter into confidentiality agreements, these agreements may not be honored and may be difficult to enforce.\nPatent litigation is widespread in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, and any patent litigation in which we become involved could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to successfully challenge the validity of third-party patents and could be required to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, for past infringement and attorneys\u2019 fees if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe such patents. Further, we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties.\nMoreover, third parties may challenge the patents that have been issued or licensed to us. There can be no assurance that our product candidates or technologies will not be found in the future to infringe upon the rights of others or be infringed upon by others. In such a case, others may assert infringement claims against us, and should we be found to infringe upon their patents, or otherwise impermissibly utilize their intellectual property, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, we may be required to obtain licenses from the holders of this intellectual property, enter into royalty agreements or redesign our compounds so as not to utilize this intellectual property, each of which may prove to be uneconomical or otherwise impossible. Conversely, we may not always be able to successfully pursue our claims against others that infringe upon our technology and the technology exclusively licensed from any third parties. Thus, the proprietary nature of our technology or technology licensed by us may not provide adequate protection against competitors.\nFurthermore, our employees may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. If we are unsuccessful in our defense of such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose the right to use valuable intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates or technologies. A loss of key research personnel work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain potential products, which could severely harm our business. Even if such claims against us are without merit, or if we challenge the validity of issued patents that are asserted against us, lawsuits in which such claims could be asserted or challenges could be made take significant time, may, even if resolved in our favor, be expensive and divert management attention from other business activities requiring attention. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation relating to intellectual property could limit our ability to continue our operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patents on our product or product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our and our licensors\u2019 inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our and our licensors\u2019 inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our and our licensors\u2019 technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we and our licensors have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may\ncompete with our product and product candidates and our and our licensors\u2019 patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of shares of our common stock is extremely volatile, which may affect our ability to raise capital in the future and may subject the value of your investment in our securities to sudden decreases.\nThe market price for securities of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, historically has been highly volatile, and the market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. For example, during the 12-month period ended March 17, 2022, our stock price ranged from a low of $1.43 to a high of $4.87. Fluctuations in the market price or liquidity of our common stock may harm the value of your investment in our common stock. The Nasdaq Stock Market, or the Nasdaq, and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In addition, broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe may not be able to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq, or trading on the Nasdaq may otherwise be halted or suspended, which may negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nWe have in the past and may in the future fail to comply with the Nasdaq requirements. If our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the Nasdaq for any reason, it may harm our stock price, increase the volatility of our stock price, decrease the level of trading activity and make it more difficult for investors to buy or sell shares of our common stock. Our failure to maintain a listing on the Nasdaq may constitute an event of default under our loan and security agreement and any future indebtedness, which would accelerate the maturity date of such debt or trigger other obligations. In addition, certain institutional investors that are not permitted to own securities of non-listed companies may be required to sell their shares adversely affecting the market price of our common stock. If we are not listed on the Nasdaq, our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted. Additionally, for so long as our non-affiliate public float does not exceed $75 million, the amount of securities that we may sell pursuant to registration statements on Form S-3 will be limited to the equivalent of one-third of our public float, which will limit our ability to file or use shelf registration statements on Form S-3 and further limit our ability to raise capital. We have relied significantly on shelf registration statements on Form S-3 for most of our financings in recent years, so any such limitations may harm our ability to raise the capital we need.\nFuture financing, strategic and other activities may require us to increase the number of authorized shares in our certificate of incorporation. An inability to secure requisite stockholder approval for such increases could materially and adversely impact our ability to fund our operations.\nAt our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, we sought and received approval of an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the total number of authorized shares and the total number of authorized shares of our common stock and we may seek approval to increase the number of authorized shares again in the future. Without future additional increases in the number of authorized shares, we may be constrained in our ability to raise capital when needed, and may lose important business opportunities, which could adversely affect our financial performance, growth and ability to continue our operations. Even if we obtain approval to further increase the number of authorized shares, we are required under the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules to obtain stockholder approval for certain issuances of additional equity securities. However, we might not be successful in obtaining the required stockholder approval for any future issuance that requires stockholder approval pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. If we are unable to obtain financing or our financing options are limited due to stockholder approval difficulties, such failure may harm our ability to continue operations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, under Delaware law and in other applicable instruments could make removal of incumbent management or an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management, to commence proxy contests or to effect changes in control. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware\u2019s anti-takeover statute, which imposes restrictions on some transactions between a corporation and certain interested stockholders. Our shareholder rights plan expired pursuant to its terms on December 2, 2018, and was not replaced; however, the Board may, subject to its fiduciary duties under applicable law, choose to implement a similar plan in the future. Likewise, because our principal executive offices are located in Washington, the anti-takeover provisions of the Washington Business Corporation Act may apply to us under certain\ncircumstances now or in the future. These provisions could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.\nRaising additional capital could cause you to incur dilution and could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nAs of December 31, 2021, options to purchase 20,690,826 shares of our common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $2.31 per share were outstanding. The exercise of any of these options would result in dilution to current stockholders. Further, because we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and clinical development programs, we may in the future sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, our compensation committee is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our employees, directors and consultants. Future option grants and issuances of common stock under our share-based compensation plans may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThese future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding options and any additional shares of common stock issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in further dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse opinion about our business, the market price of our common stock and the trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If too few securities or industry analysts cover our company, the market price of our common stock would likely be negatively impacted. If securities and industry analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause the market price of our common stock and the trading volume of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 84604, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CTIC"}
