RISK FACTORS.\nOur business is challenged by a changing environment that involves many known and unknown risks and uncertainties. The risks described below discuss factors that have affected and/or could affect us in the future. There may be others. We may be affected by risks that are currently unknown to us or are immaterial at this time. If any such events did occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in a material manner. Our future results may also be impacted by other risk factors listed from time to time in our future filings with the SEC, including, but not limited to, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. As the most significant portion of our consolidated entity is represented by the power industry services reportable business segment, the risk factor discussions included below are focused on that business. However, as a large number of these same risks exist for our other reportable segments, (1) industrial fabrication and field services, and (2) telecommunications infrastructure services, a review and assessment of the following risk factors should be performed with that in mind.\nThis section of our Form 10-K Annual Report for the year ended January 31, 2020 (our \u201c2020 Annual Report\u201d) may include projections, assumptions and beliefs that are intended to be \u201cforward looking statements.\u201d They should be read in light of our cautionary statement regarding \u201cforward looking statements\u201d that is presented in Item 7 of our 2020 Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe completion of the TeesREP project may require the booking of additional contract losses.\nManagement expects that the forecasted costs for APC at the completion of the TeesREP project will exceed projected revenues by approximately $33.6 million. The entire amount of this loss was recorded and reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2020.\nIn December 2019, APC and its customer, the engineering, procurement and construction services contractor on the TeesREP project, agreed to operational and commercial terms for the completion of the project. This framework generally addresses project schedule, payment terms, scope, performance guarantees and other terms and conditions for APC reaching substantial completion of its portion of the total project by mid-2020. The framework does not resolve significant past commercial differences which may have to be addressed through applicable dispute resolution mechanisms. It is not possible currently to predict precisely how, when and on what terms (if any) the past commercial differences will be resolved. Failure to negotiate the favorable resolution of the commercial differences may cause us to record additional losses on this project that may be material. Additional losses may also be incurred during the completion of the project due to a variety of possible causes including weather delays, work stoppages, the COVID-19 pandemic, productivity declines, construction schedule delays, the financial instability of our customer or other causes beyond the control of APC. Our failure to recover the unforeseen costs that may be incurred by us related to such events may result in our recording additional losses. In summary, until we have completed all activities on this project and have resolved all commercial differences with our customer, it is possible that we may be required to record additional losses related to this project that may be material to our future consolidated results of operations.\nFuture revenues and earnings are dependent on the awards of new EPC projects, the receipt of corresponding full notices-to-proceed and our ability to successfully complete the projects that we start.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenues related to performance by the power industry services segment which provided 57%, 76% and 91% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Due primarily to the favorable operating results of GPS, the major business component of this segment, we have generated consolidated net income for nine of the last ten years. Revenues for the power industry services reporting segment decreased from the prior year by 63% for Fiscal 2020 and 55% for Fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2020 operating results for this segment were adversely affected in a material manner by the contract loss incurred by our APC subsidiary in the UK and the delay in the project starts on EPC services contracts in the US. However, the aggregate amount of the rated output of electrical power for the five planned gas-fired power plants for which we had signed EPC services contracts as of January 31, 2020 was 5.8 gigawatts. Subsequently, GPS signed EPC services contracts for two additional natural gas-fired power plants which will provide an additional 1.6 gigawatts of electrical output. Our ability to achieve sustained profitable operations depends on many factors including the ability of the power industry services business to gain significant new EPC projects, to obtain the corresponding full notices-to-proceed and to complete its projects successfully.We have received a full notice to proceed for only one of these new EPC projects and there is always a possibility that one or more of the other projects will not be built. Should we fail to commence construction activities on some of these major projects during the year ending January 31, 2021 (\u201cFiscal 2021\u201d), the growth in revenues and profits that we expect for Fiscal 2021 will be adversely affected.\n- 10 -\nOur dependence on a few customers could adversely affect us.\nThe size of the energy plant construction projects of our power industry services segment frequently results in a limited number of projects contributing a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues each year. For Fiscal 2020, the Company\u2019s most significant customer relationships included two power industry service customers which together accounted for 37% of consolidated revenues. For Fiscal 2019, the Company\u2019s most significant customer relationships included four power industry service customers which together accounted for 51% of consolidated revenues. For Fiscal 2018, the Company\u2019s most significant customer relationships included four power industry service customers which together represented 84% of consolidated revenues. Should we fail to obtain the award of any one new major project that we expect, substantial portions of future consolidated revenues and profits may be adversely affected.\nOur dependence on large construction contracts may result in uneven financial results.\nOur power industry service activities in any one fiscal reporting period are concentrated on a limited number of large construction projects for which we recognize revenues over time as we transfer control of the project asset to the customer. To a substantial extent, our contract revenues are based on the amounts of costs incurred. As the timing of equipment purchases, subcontractor services and other contract events may not be evenly distributed over the terms of our contracts, the amount of total contract costs may vary from quarter to quarter, creating uneven amounts of quarterly and/or annual consolidated revenues. In addition, the timing of contract commencements and completions may exacerbate the uneven pattern. As a result of the foregoing, future reported amounts of consolidated revenues, cash flow from operations, net income and earnings per share may vary in an uneven pattern and may not be indicative of the operating results expected for any other fiscal period, thus rendering consecutive quarter comparisons of our consolidated operating results a less meaningful way to assess the growth of our business.\nActual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements.\nTo prepare consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the US, we are required to make estimates, assumptions and judgments as of the date of such financial statements, which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. For example, we have recognized revenues over the life of a contract based on the proportion of costs incurred to date compared to the total costs estimated to be incurred for the entire project. We review and make necessary revisions to such costs on a monthly basis. In addition, contract results may be impacted by our estimates of the amounts of change orders that we expect to receive and our assessment of any contract disputes that may arise.\nIn accordance with the new accounting rules governing revenue recognition, we recognize substantial portions of our revenues over time as performance obligations are completed by us. In most cases, such progress will be measured in a manner similar to past accounting practices using a cost-to-cost method. This methodology allows us to recognize revenues over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the costs incurred to date against the total amount of costs expected to be incurred, and using the resulting percentage to update the recorded amounts of project-to-date revenues. The effects on revenues of changes to the amounts of contract values and estimated costs typically will be recorded as catch-up adjustments when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated. These revisions can occur at any time and could be material. Given the uncertainties associated with the types of customer contracts that we are awarded, it is possible for contract values and actual costs to vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits.\nOther areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:\n\u2022\nthe assessment of the value of goodwill and recoverability of other purchased intangible assets;\n\u2022\nthe determination of provisions for income taxes, the accounting for uncertain income tax positions and the establishment of valuation allowances associated with deferred income tax assets;\n\u2022\nthe determination of the fair value of stock-based incentive awards;\n\u2022\nthe identification of the primary beneficiary of entities in which we may have variable interests;\n\u2022\naccruals for estimated liabilities, including warranties and losses and expenses related to legal matters; and\n\u2022\nthe initial valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates, which may impact future profits.\n- 11 -\nProject backlog amounts may be uncertain indicators of future revenues as project realization may be subject to unexpected adjustments, delays and cancellations.\nAt January 31, 2020, the total value of our project backlog was $1.3 billion. Project cancellations or scope modifications may occur that could reduce the amount of our project backlog and the associated revenues and profits that we actually earn. Projects that are awarded to us may remain included in our backlog for extended periods of time as customers experience project delays. Should any unexpected delay, suspension or termination of the work under such contracts occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. For example, in March 2018, GPS entered into an EPC services contract to build a 500 MW natural gas-fired power plant that was added to project backlog. However, due to customer delays including a grid connection dispute, contract activities have not yet started. We cannot guarantee that revenues projected by us based on our project backlog at January 31, 2020 will be recognized or will result in profitable operating results.\nIf financing for new energy plants is unavailable or too expensive, construction of such plants may not occur.\nHistorically, natural gas-fired power plants have been constructed typically for large utility companies. To a large extent, the construction of new energy plants by us is performed for independent power producers. This type of project owner may be challenged in obtaining the equity financing necessary to commence the project. Accordingly, debt financing for the construction of new facilities may not be available or it may become cost prohibitive, thereby adversely affecting the likelihood that the planned projects will be built and jeopardizing potential sources of future revenues for us.\nUnsuccessful efforts to develop energy plant projects could result in write-offs and the loss of future business.\nThe development of a power plant construction project is expensive with a total cost that could approximate or exceed $10 million. The commercial developers of power projects may form single purpose entities, such as limited liability companies, limited partnerships or joint ventures, to perform the development activities, which are often funded by outside sources. We periodically see business opportunities where we consider providing financial support to the ownership of a new project, at least during the development phase, in order to improve the probability of an EPC contract being awarded to us.\nIn the past, we have been successful in lending funds to single purpose entities formed to develop gas-fired power plants. Each successful involvement resulted in repayment of the loans to us and, more critically, the award to us of the EPC contacts for the construction of the corresponding plant. In addition, the completed development efforts resulted in our receipt of success fees. Other project development support efforts have not been successful, resulting in the write-off of loan and interest balances.\nAt present, we are supporting the development efforts for certain new gas-fired power plant projects including funding provided under development loans and other forms of credit support. There can be no assurances that we will benefit from the successful development of these projects or others that may arise in the future. The failure of owners to complete the development of power plants could result in the loss of future potential construction business and could result in write-off adjustments related to the balance of any project development costs or amounts lent or credit extended to potential project owners. Further, our failure to obtain the opportunity to support future power plant development projects and the potential to build the associated power plants could be detrimental to future growth. Large unfavorable adjustments related to current and/or future developmental projects could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for a future reporting period.\nFuture bonding requirements may adversely affect our ability to compete for new energy plant construction projects.\nOur construction contracts frequently require that we obtain payment and performance bonds from surety companies on behalf of project owners as a condition to the contract award. Historically, we have had a strong bonding capacity. However, under standard terms, surety companies issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing any bonds. Not all of our projects require bonding. As of January 31, 2020, the estimated value of future work covered by outstanding performance bonds was approximately $734 million. In addition, there were bonds outstanding in the aggregate amount of approximately $152 million covering other risks including our warranty obligations related to four EPC services projects substantially completed by GPS during Fiscal 2019.\nMarket conditions, changes in our performance or financial position, changes in our surety\u2019s assessment of its own operating and financial risk or larger future projects could cause our surety company to decline to issue, or substantially reduce the amount of bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs. These actions can be taken on short notice. If our surety company were to limit or eliminate our access to new bonds, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other surety companies, joint venturing with other construction firms, increasing business with clients that do not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit, or cash.\nWe may be unable to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Accordingly, if we were to experience an interruption, reduction or other alteration in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects.\n- 12 -\nOur results could be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other adverse weather and climate conditions; or other catastrophic events could disrupt our operations, or the operations of one or more of our vendors or customers. In particular, these types of events could shut-down our construction job sites or fabrication facilities for indefinite periods of time, break our product supply chain from the impacted region or could cause our customers to delay or cancel projects, which could impact our ability to operate. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nEffects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak will adversely impact our business (see Note 19 to the accompanying financial statements for disclosure of subsequent events related to the outbreak).\nLike many other companies, the coronavirus outbreak is impacting our supply chain. The Company and certain of its major original equipment manufacturers source certain supplies, materials and equipment from countries afflicted by the outbreak. Production disruptions related to the spreading of this virus could impact our schedules, thereby affecting our ability to complete large fixed-price contract projects in accordance with original schedules. Now that the outbreak has become a global pandemic, it could further challenge our ability to conduct operations normally, especially at job sites where sustained labor productivity is essential to the achievement of successful projects. We have protections in our contracts with major customers that provide certain relief that helps to mitigate certain financial risks. The effectiveness of these protections may be limited by underlying issues and financial challenges at our customers. We are actively attempting to manage these various risks. However, due to the uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the COVID-19 outbreak, the extent of the operational and financial impacts on the Company will depend on how long and how disperse the disruptions prove to be in a variety of areas, including the capital markets, the Company\u2019s customers and supply chains, and the Company\u2019s labor force. The current impacts of the outbreak on the Company\u2019s businesses are not quantifiable at this time.\nRisks Related to Our Market\nContinued disruption of PJM\u2019s Base Residual Auction schedule may delay the start of planned power projects.\nPJM Interconnection LLC (\u201cPJM\u201d), founded in 1927, ensures the reliability of the high-voltage electric power system serving 65 million people in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. PJM coordinates and directs the operation of the region\u2019s transmission grid; administers a competitive wholesale electricity market; and plans regional transmission expansion improvements to maintain grid reliability and relieve congestion. PJM operates a capacity market, called the Reliability Pricing Model (\u201cRPM\u201d), which is a process to ensure long-term grid reliability by securing the appropriate amount of power supply resources needed to meet predicted future energy demands. An RPM base residual auction for a particular delivery year is usually held during the month of May, three years prior to the actual delivery year.\nThe accuracy and viability of future power revenue forecasts by power plant operators and project owners depends, to a significant degree, on the amount of future capacity supply secured for a particular power source located within PJM\u2019s region. For new power projects, lack of visibility regarding future capacity revenue streams complicates the search for equity and debt financing considerably. Most of our recently completed and awarded EPC service contracts relate to natural gas-fired power plants located in the PJM region.\nIn December 2019, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d) voted to effectively raise the bids of subsidized resources selling their power into PJM\u2019s wholesale capacity market. New resources receiving subsidies will now be subject to a rule which raises the price floor for those resources attempting to sell their power into the wholesale market. The move was intended to prevent potential unacceptable market distorting effects caused by state clean energy policies. Clean energy advocates and other market observers fear FERC's move will severely hinder incentives intended to bring new zero emissions resources online, while favoring incumbent fossil fuels. Pursuant to FERC\u2019s requirements, PJM submitted its compliance filing with FERC on March 18, 2020, attempting to balance disparate stakeholder input. In the filing, PJM proposes to run the 2022/2023 delivery year auction six months after FERC approves its compliance filing, as long as the auction is concluded no later than March 2021, and to run subsequent auctions with as little as six months in between to help maintain an orderly process for each auction while working to return to a normal auction schedule. PJM had previously suspended all auction activities and deadlines relating to the RPM base residual auctions for the 2022/2023 and 2023/2024 electricity delivery years.\nThe uncertainty relating to PJM capacity auctions may continue to disrupt capital markets for project owners. The commencement of new EPC service power plant projects by us may be delayed until PJM receives FERC approval of new capacity auction bidding rules and definitive future capacity auction schedules are announced.\n- 13 -\nThe decline in electricity capacity market prices may discourage future investment in new gas-fired power plant development.\nThe results for PJM\u2019s most recent capacity auction (posted in May 2018) included a general clearing price that increased by more than 82% from the corresponding price in the previous year, but was still 15% below the price three years previous. With the exception of the most recent auction, decreased capacity pricing reflects increased participation by new generation capacity resources mostly represented by new or updated gas-fired power plants. The electricity generation units clearing the most recent auction did not include any new gas-fired power plants. If future capacity auction clearing prices were to resume their fall in the US, power plant developers may be discouraged from commencing the development and construction of new power plants which would adversely impact our business.\nIf the pace of future shutdown of existing coal-fired power plants slows or future policy changes encourage coal-fired and/or nuclear power-plant operations, the demand for our construction services could decline.\nThe overall growth of our power business has been substantially based on the number of combined cycle gas-fired power plants built by us, as many coal-fired plants have been shut down and the enthusiasm for nuclear-powered electricity generation has waned in the US. Over the last ten years, the electricity-generation capacity represented by coal-fired power plants in the US declined by approximately 30%. During 2019, power companies retired or converted roughly 15,100 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired electricity generation, enough to power about 15 million homes. That retirement capacity reduction was second only to the record 19,300 MW of capacity shut down in 2015. In 1990, coal-fired power plants accounted for about 52% of total electricity generation. By the end of 2019, coal accounted for less than 24% of total electricity generation. The use of coal as a power source has been adversely affected primarily by the inexpensive supply of natural gas. Most nuclear power plants were built before 1990. Nuclear energy\u2019s share of total US electricity generation has held steady at about 20% since 1990. The future of nuclear power plant construction is clouded. The abandonment of the partially completed reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear power generation plant in South Carolina was accompanied by the project owner\u2019s announcement of a reluctance to saddle customers with increasing costs. Just two nuclear power plant reactors are under construction in the US today (the Vogtle plant units 3 and 4).\nThe pace of these changes has been energized by environmental activism, environmental regulations targeting coal-fired power plants and public fear of nuclear power plants. In the reference case of the Annual Energy Outlook 2020, the Energy Information Administration (\u201cEIA\u201d) predicts that coal-fired and nuclear power generation capacity will decline approximately 47% and 20% by 2050, respectively, and will represent only 14% and 13% shares of the electricity generation mix by 2050, respectively.\nHowever, the policies and actions of the federal government may present risks to our power industry services business. The administration of President Trump may continue to reduce or eliminate environmental rules and regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions and may support coal and nuclear-fired power plants for the sake of grid resilience. Should the federal government weaken or eliminate anti-pollution regulations or adopt policies that advance support for the operation of nuclear power plants, power plant operators may slow the rate of coal-fired and nuclear-powered electricity generation plant shutdowns, thereby reducing the number of future gas-fired power plant construction opportunities for us in the future.\nSoft demand for electrical power may cause deterioration in our financial outlook.\nDuring 2018 and for the first time in 12 years, the total annual amount of electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the US surpassed the total amount generated in the peak power generation year of 2007 as the total amount of electricity generation was approximately 100.5% of the level for 2007. The recently published government reference-case outlook forecasts average increases to utility-scale electricity generation in the US of less than 1% per year through 2050.\nHowever, for calendar year 2019, the total amount of electricity generated by utility-scale power plants declined by 1.3%. Prior to 2018, total electric power generation from all sources had decreased over three years. Power demand gains related to economic growth and population increases have been offset by the effects of private electricity generation and energy efficient devices. The largest share of electricity generation by utility-scale power sources in the US is fueled by natural gas. Further softening of future demand for electrical power in the US, which will likely occur in the near term due to adverse impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, could result in the delay, curtailment or cancellation of future gas-fired power plant projects, thus decreasing the overall demand for our EPC services and adversely impacting the financial outlook for our power industry services business.\n- 14 -\nIntense global competition for engineering, procurement and construction contracts could reduce our market share.\nThe competitive landscape in the EPC services market for natural gas-fired power plants has changed significantly over the last few years. Several significant competitors announced their exit from the market for a variety of reasons. Others have announced intentions to avoid entering into fixed-price contracts citing the disproportionate financial risks born by contractors. However, the market remains dynamic, and competitors include, among others, Kiewit Corporation, Bechtel Corporation and Black & Veatch Corporation. These and other competitors are multibillion-dollar companies with thousands of employees. Competing effectively in our market requires substantial financial resources, the availability of skilled personnel and equipment when needed and the effective use of technology.\nCompetition places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins and may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are not normal or customary, thereby increasing the risk that we may incur losses on such contracts. Meaningful competition is expected to continue in our market, presenting us with significant challenges to our achieving strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges and start new projects that provide desirable margins, we could lose market share to our competitors, experience overall reductions in future revenues and profits or incur losses.\nOur revenues and profitability may be adversely affected by a reduced level of activity in the hydrocarbon industry.\nChanges in oil or natural gas prices or activities in the hydrocarbon industry could adversely affect the demand for our services. The vast new supplies of natural gas have caused, in part, low prices for natural gas in the US. Future predictions of power generation are based in large part on the belief that natural gas supplies will remain plentiful resulting in a relatively low and stable price for natural gas in the foreseeable future. However, future oil or natural gas prices that are too low may result in cutbacks in exploration, extraction and production activities which may lead to reductions in future supplies of natural gas.\nSubsequent to January 31, 2020, the global price of oil became very unstable. In March 2020, the global price for a barrel of oil tumbled by 25% during one day, and the price in the US hit an 18-year low. The continuing oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia showed no signs of abating. A sustained depression in the price of oil may have the opposite effect on the future price of natural gas. The low price of oil could result in the curtailment of all drilling activities, thereby decreasing supplies of natural gas and increasing natural gas prices. A meaningful rise in natural gas prices, which could also be caused or exacerbated by the significant exporting of liquefied natural gas, may adversely impact the favorable economic factors for project owners as they consider the construction of natural gas-fired power plants in the future. Any reduction in the number of future power plant project construction or improvement opportunities could adversely affect our power industry service business.\nIn addition, certain of our existing customers have meaningful exposure to the oil business. Continued instability in the oil markets could negatively impact their businesses and associated liquidity and potentially result in an inability to pay monies owed to us.\nThe continuous rise in renewables could reduce the number of future gas-fired power plant projects.\nThe share of electricity generation in the US provided by utility-scale wind and solar photovoltaic facilities continues to gradually increase. Together, such power facilities provided approximately 9.6%, 9.9% and 10.8% of the total amount of electricity generated by utility-scale power facilities in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. In EIA\u2019s 2020 reference case, electricity generating capacity from wind and solar powered sources is expected to increase by more than 360%, representing over 30% of total capacity, by 2050. Impetus for this growth has been provided by various factors including laws and regulations that discourage new fossil-fuel burning power plants, environmental activism, income tax advantages that promote the growth of wind and solar power, the decline in the amount of renewable power plant component and power storage costs and the increase in the scale of energy storage capacity. Should the pace of development for renewable energy facilities, including wind and solar power plants, accelerate at faster rates than forecast, the number of future natural gas-fired construction project opportunities for us may fall. We have successfully built utility-scale wind and solar farms in the past, and we have renewed the pursuit of such projects as a core business development focus. Failure to obtain future awards for the erection of wind and solar-powered utility-scale power projects could have adverse effects on our future revenues, profits and cash flows.\n- 15 -\nUncertain economic and political conditions may increase the difficulty of forecasting future domestic business levels.\nCertain regulatory and political conditions in the US may make it more difficult for our customers, our subcontractors and suppliers and us to predict accurately future business levels and to plan future business activities. For example, changes to policies have resulted in uncertainty regarding the future of global trade due to actual and threatened trade restrictions in the US as well as possible retaliatory trade measures that may be implemented by other countries. The availability of construction and manufacturing materials, such as steel, aluminum and lumber, at predictable and reasonable prices when we need them is crucial to the ability of GPS and TRC to complete projects profitably, particularly those performed under fixed-price contract basis. We cannot predict the outcome of these changing trade policies or other unanticipated regulatory or political conditions or their ultimate effects on our ability to manage our businesses profitably.\nUnexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.\nOur business is also subject to international economic and political conditions that change for reasons which are beyond our control. Such changes may have unfavorable consequences for us. Operating in the international marketplace, which for us exists primarily in the Republic of Ireland and the UK, may expose us to a number of risks including:\n\u2022 abrupt changes in domestic and/or foreign government policies, laws, treaties (including those impacting trade), regulations or leadership;\n\u2022 embargoes or other trade restrictions, including sanctions;\n\u2022 restrictions on currency movement;\n\u2022 tax or tariff increases;\n\u2022 currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022 changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n\u2022 other social, political and economic instability.\nFurther, the ultimate impacts of the UK\u2019s exit from the European Economic Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) on the economies of the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the stability of their currencies are currently unknown.\nOur level of exposure to these risks will vary on each significant project we perform there, depending on the location and the particular stage of the project. To the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic changes, including trade retaliation from certain countries, we may experience project disruptions and losses which could significantly reduce our consolidated revenues and profits, or cause losses at the consolidated level.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment\nFuture construction projects may depend on the continuing acceptability of the hydraulic fracturing process in certain states.\nThe viability of the gas-fired power plants that we build is based substantially on the availability of inexpensive natural gas supplies provided through the use of hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) combined with horizontal drilling techniques. Certain technological advancements led to the widespread use of fracking and horizontal drilling enabling drillers to reach natural gas and oil deposits previously trapped within shale rock formations deep under the earth\u2019s surface. The access to new oil and gas reserves are transforming the oil and gas industry in the US. In particular, the new supplies of natural gas have lowered the price of natural gas in the US and reduced its volatility, making the operation of natural gas-fired power plants more economically appealing. However, the process of fracking uses large volumes of highly pressurized water to break-up the shale rock formations and to free the trapped natural gas and oil. This process is controversial due to concerns about the disposal of the waste water, the possible contamination of nearby water supplies and the risk of potential seismic events.\nAs a result, not all states permit the use of fracking. In addition, contenders for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2020 threatened that the practice would be further limited or suspended across the country. Should future evidence confirm the concerns, should a major contamination or seismic episode occur in the future or should the political control of the White House change in 2020, the use of fracking may be suspended, limited, or curtailed by state and/or federal authorities. As a result, the supply of inexpensive natural gas may not be available in the future and the economic viability of gas-fired power plants may be jeopardized. A reduction in the pace of the construction of new gas-fired power plants would have a significantly adverse effect on our future operating results.\n- 16 -\nWe may be affected by regulatory responses to the fear of climate change.\nGrowing concerns about climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations on the operators of fossil-fuel burning power plants. Legislation, international protocols or new regulations and other restrictions on emissions promulgated by government agencies could affect those entities, including our customers in some cases, who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels. Concerns about global warming, climate change and other conditions provided motivation for the Green New Deal Resolution promoted by progressive members of the US Congress which is supported by numerous environmental groups. The plan pushes for transitioning the US to use 100% renewable, zero-emission energy sources and implementing the \u201csocial cost of carbon\u201d within 10 years.\nWe cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on or customers or on us. Such policy changes could increase the costs of natural gas-fired power plant projects for our customers or decrease the cost of competing renewable power projects through subsidies or other means, thereby, in some cases, ruining the economic or regulatory viability of a future gas-fired power plant development project. The impact could be a reduction of the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe inability of power project developers to receive or to avoid delay in receiving the applicable regulatory approvals relating to new power plants may result in lost or postponed revenues for us.\nThe commencement and/or execution of the types of projects performed by our power industry services reporting segment are subject to numerous regulatory permitting processes. Applications for the variety of clean air, water purity and construction permits may be opposed by individuals or environmental groups, resulting in delays and possible denial of the permits. There are no assurances that our project owner customers will obtain the necessary permits for these projects, or that the necessary permits will be obtained in order to allow construction work to proceed as scheduled. Failure to commence or complete construction work as anticipated could have material adverse impacts on our future revenues, profits and cash flows.\nThe viability of new natural gas-fired power plants depends on the availability of nearby sources of natural gas for fuel which may require the construction of new pipelines for the delivery of gas to a power plant location. A planned plant may also depend on the erection of transmission lines for the delivery of the newly generated electricity to the grid. Concerns about climate change have also resulted in increased environmental activism that represents opposition to the regulatory approval of any fossil-fuel energy project. Approval delays and public opposition to new oil and gas pipelines have become major potential hurdles for the developers of gas-fired power plants and other fossil fuel facilities. The slowdown in permitting processes is due, at least in part, to the increase in environmental activism that garners media attention and fosters public skepticism about new projects. In particular, pipeline projects are delayed by onsite protest demonstrations, indecision by local officials and lawsuits. Approval difficulties may jeopardize projects that are needed to bring supplies of natural gas to proposed gas-fired power plant sites or electricity to the grid thereby increasing the risk of gas-fired power plant delays or cancellations.\nWe could be subject to compliance with environmental laws and regulations that would add costs to our business.\nOur operations are subject to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances. We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps to ensure compliance with environmental laws, however, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nWork stoppages, union negotiations and other labor problems could adversely affect us.\nThe performance of certain large-scale construction contracts results in the hiring of employees represented by labor unions. We do make sincere efforts to maintain favorable relationships and conduct good-faith negotiations with union officials. However, there can be no assurances that such efforts will eliminate the possibilities of unfavorable conflicts in the future. A lengthy strike or the occurrence of other work stoppages or slowdowns at any of our current or future construction project sites could have an adverse effect on us, resulting in cost overruns and schedule delays that could be significant. In addition, it is possible that labor incidents result in negative publicity for us thereby damaging our business reputation and perhaps harming our prospects for the receipt of future construction contract awards in certain locales.\n- 17 -\nRisks Related to Our Operational Execution\nWe may experience reduced profits or incur losses under fixed price contracts if costs increase above estimates.\nPrimarily, our business is performed under long-term, fixed price contracts at prices that reflect our estimates of corresponding costs and schedules. Inaccuracies in these estimates may lead to cost overruns that may not be paid by our project owner customers. If we fail to accurately estimate the resources required and time necessary to complete these types of contracts, or if we fail to complete these contracts within the costs and timeframes to which we have agreed, there could be material impacts on our financial results as well as our business reputation.\nFactors that could result in contract cost overruns, project delays or other problems for us may include:\n\u2022\ndelays in the scheduled deliveries of machinery and equipment ordered by us or a project owner;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in our obtaining permits, rights of way or approvals;\n\u2022\nunanticipated technical problems, including design or engineering issues;\n\u2022\ninadequate project execution tools for recording, tracking, forecasting and controlling future costs and schedules;\n\u2022\nunforeseen increases in the costs of labor, warranties, raw materials, components or equipment, or our failure or inability to obtain resources when needed;\n\u2022\nreliance on historical cost and/or execution data that is not representative of current conditions;\n\u2022\ndelays or productivity issues caused by weather conditions, or other forces majeure (i.e., pandemics);\n\u2022\nincorrect assumptions related to labor productivity, scheduling estimates or future economic conditions, including the impacts of inflation on fixed-price contracts; and\n\u2022\nmodifications to projects that create unanticipated costs or delays.\nThese risks tend to be exacerbated for longer-term contracts because there is increased risk that the circumstances under which we based our original cost estimates or project schedules will change with a resulting increase in costs or delays in achieving scheduled milestones. In such events, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted. We try to mitigate these risks by reflecting in our overall cost estimates the reasonable possibility that a number of different and potentially unfavorable outcomes might occur. If certain risk scenarios transpire and a cost overrun occurs on a project, it is possible that our overall cost estimate can absorb the cost overrun. There are no assurances that our estimates will be sufficient. If not, our misjudgments may lead to decreased profits or losses. In some cases, as certain risk scenarios are eliminated or our concerns regarding certain potential cost and/or schedule issues diminish, we may estimate that the likelihood of an unforeseen cost overrun has reduced and, accordingly, we may increase the estimated gross margin on the project by decreasing the remaining overall cost estimate.\nOur work on the TeesREP project in the UK has been performed primarily pursuant to a fixed-price subcontract. Based on the completed analyses that have been updated multiple times through Fiscal 2020, management expects that the forecasted costs for APC at contract completion will exceed projected revenues by approximately $33.6 million. The entire amount of this loss was recorded and is reflected in our operating results for Fiscal 2020. However, as stated above, it is reasonably possible that unforeseen future difficulties on this project resulting in costs that cannot be recovered from the customer will cause us to record additional loss related to this project in the future.\nIf we guarantee the timely completion or the performance of a project, we could incur additional costs to fulfill such obligations.\nIn many of our fixed price long-term contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a scheduled date. We sometimes provide that the project, when completed, will also achieve certain performance standards. Subsequently, we may fail to complete the project on time or equipment that we install may not meet guaranteed performance standards. In those cases, we may be held responsible for costs incurred by the customer resulting from any delay or any modification to the plant made in order to achieve the performance standards, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages or obligations to re-perform substandard work. If we are required to pay such costs, the total costs of the project would likely exceed our original estimate, and we could experience reduced profits or a loss related to the applicable project.\n- 18 -\nWe may be involved in litigation, liability claims and contract disputes which could reduce our profits and cash flows.\nWe build large and complex energy plants where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties. In addition, the nature of our business results in project owners, subcontractors and vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs that they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. In other cases, project owners may withhold retention and/or contract payments, for which they believe they do not contractually owe us or based on their interpretation of the contract, or even terminate the contract. We have been, are, and may be in the future, named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may allege breach of contract and seek recovery for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters (see Legal Proceedings in Item 3 below for allegations made against us). These legal matters generally arise in the normal course of our business. In addition, from time to time, we and/or certain of our current or former directors, officers or employees may be named as parties to other types of lawsuits.\nLitigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and proceedings may occur over several years. As a result, it is typically not possible to predict the likely outcome of legal actions with certainty, but it is likely that any significant lawsuit or other claim against us that involves lengthy legal maneuvering may have a material adverse effect on us regardless of the outcome. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us could result in our payment of significant sums for damages and other losses. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation may be costly and time-consuming, and would likely divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations over multi-year periods. Either outcome may result in adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face. When it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of any liability may exceed our policy limits or self-insurance reserves. Further, we may elect not to carry insurance related to particular risks if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks. Our management liability insurance policies are on a \u201cclaims-made\u201d basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposures, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits and self-insurance reserves or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could result in a significant loss for us, which claims may reduce our future profits and cash available for operations.\nOur failure to recover adequately on contract variations submitted to project owners could have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe may submit contract variations to project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. For example, in January 2019, we filed a lawsuit against a project owner for breach of contract and failure to remedy various conditions which negatively affected the schedule and costs associated with the construction of a gas-fired power plant. APC has submitted a number of meaningful contract variation requests to its customer on the TeesREP project. Both of these matters remained unresolved at January 31, 2020. These variations occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, both of which may result in additional costs. At times, contract variation submissions can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when these differences will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved matters are pending, we have used existing liquidity to cover cost overruns pending their resolution. The aggregate amount of contract variations included in the transaction prices that were used to determine project-to-date revenues for all of our projects at January 31, 2020 was $20.6 million. A failure to promptly recover on these types of customer submissions could have a negative impact on our liquidity and profitability in the future.\nThe shortage of skilled craft labor may negatively impact our ability to execute on our long-term construction contracts.\nIncreased infrastructure spending and general economic expansion has increased the demand for employees with the types of skills we desire. There is a risk that our construction project schedules become unachievable or that labor expenses will increase unexpectedly as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel available to us. Labor shortages, productivity decreases or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues. The inability to hire and retain qualified skilled employees in the future, including workers in the construction crafts, could negatively impact our ability to complete our long-term construction contracts successfully.\n- 19 -\nOur dependence upon third parties to complete many of our contracts may adversely affect our performance under current and future construction contracts.\nCertain of the work performed under our energy plant construction contracts is actually performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. We also rely on third-party manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and most of the materials (such as copper, concrete and steel) needed to complete our construction projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be adversely impacted. If the price we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds the corresponding amount that we have estimated, we may suffer a loss on the contract. If a supplier, manufacturer or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, equipment or services as required under a negotiated contract for any reason, we may be required to self-perform unexpected work or obtain these supplies, equipment or services on an expedited basis or at a higher price than anticipated from a substitute source, which could impact contract profitability in an adverse manner. Unresolved disputes with a subcontractor or supplier regarding the scope of work or performance may escalate, resulting in arbitration proceedings or legal actions (see Legal Proceedings in Item 3 below). Unfavorable outcomes of such disputes may also impact contract profitability in an adverse manner. In addition, if a subcontractor fails to pay its subcontractors, suppliers or employees, liens may be placed on our project requiring us to incur the costs of reimbursing such parties in order to have the liens removed or to commence litigation.\nIf we are unable to collect amounts billed to project owners as scheduled, our cash flows may be adversely affected.\nMany of our contracts require us to satisfy specified design, engineering, procurement or construction milestones in order to receive payment for work completed or equipment or supplies procured prior to achievement of the applicable contract milestone. As a result, under these types of arrangements, we may incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of services prior to receipt of payment. If the project owner determines not to proceed with the completion of the project, terminates the contract, delays in making payment of billed amounts or defaults on its payment obligations, we may face delays or other difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended to purchase equipment or supplies. The lawsuit that we filed in January 2019 as discussed above, among other recoveries, seeks to compel a project owner to make payments to us for overdue outstanding invoices that were billed in accordance with the corresponding EPC contract. Such problems may impact the planned cash flows of affected projects and result in unanticipated reductions in the amounts of future cash flows from operations.\nFailure to maintain safe work sites could result in significant losses as we work on projects that are inherently dangerous.\nWe often work on large-scale and complex projects, sometimes in geographically remote locations. Our project sites can place our employees and others near large and/or mechanized equipment, high voltage electrical equipment, moving vehicles, dangerous processes or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation. Often, we are responsible for safety on the project sites where we work. Many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts. Further, regulatory changes implemented by OSHA or similar government agencies could impose additional costs on us. We maintain programs with the primary purpose of implementing effective health, safety and environmental procedures throughout our Company. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries. The failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability, and adversely impact our ability to obtain projects in the future. Our OSHA reportable incident rates, weighted by hours worked for all of our subsidiaries, were 0.40 and 0.54 for calendar 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our actual rates were significantly better than the national averages in our industry (NAICS - 2379) for those years.\nFuture acquisitions and/or investments may not occur which could limit the growth of our business, and the integration of acquired companies may not be successful.\nWe are a holding company with no operations other than our investments in GPS, APC, TRC and SMC. We want to make additional acquisitions and/or investments that would provide positive cash flow to us and value to our stockholders. However, additional companies meeting these criteria and that provide products and/or services in growth industries and that are available for purchase at attractive prices are difficult to find. Discussions with the principal(s) of potential acquisition targets may be protracted and ultimately terminated for a variety of reasons. Further, due diligence investigations of attractive target companies may uncover unfavorable data, and the negotiation and consummation of acquisition agreements may not be successful.\nWe cannot readily predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions or the capital we will need for these transactions. However, it is likely that any potential future acquisition or strategic investment transaction would require the use of cash and/or shares of our common stock as components of the purchase price. Using cash for acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future may depend upon prevailing capital market conditions, the strength of our future operating results and financial condition as well as conditions in our business, and the amount of outside financing sought by us. These factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Our ability to use shares of our common stock as future acquisition consideration may be limited by a variety of factors, including the future market price of shares of our common stock and a potential seller\u2019s assessment of the liquidity of our common stock. If adequate funds or the use of our common stock are not available to us, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of desirable acquisitions or other investment opportunities that would benefit our business. Even if we do complete acquisitions in the future, acquired companies may fail to achieve the results we anticipate including the expected gross profit percentages.\n- 20 -\nIn general, we keep each of our subsidiary operations separate and distinct. However, we do integrate certain aspects to drive synergies and cost reductions. In the future, we may not be able to successfully integrate such acquired companies with our other operations without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other important operational matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u2022\ninability to retain key personnel of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruptions to our current business;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties in the maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, including an effective system of internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u2022\nimpairment losses related to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, circumstances have caused us to record impairment losses related to the goodwill of TRC during the last three fiscal years in the aggregate amount of $4.9 million, and related to the goodwill of APC in the amount of $2.1 million during Fiscal 2020. Since Fiscal 2016, the year that both APC and TRC were acquired, we have recorded impairment losses representing 34% of the goodwill amount originally established for TRC and 100% of the original amount of goodwill related to APC. The continuing inability of either TRC or APC to achieve sustained profitable operating results will adversely affect our future consolidated operating results, including gross profits, gross profit percentages and cash flows from operations and, in the case of TRC, may result in additional goodwill impairment losses.\nIf one of our acquired companies suffers performance problems, the reputation of our Company could be materially and adversely affected. Future acquisitions could result in issuances of equity securities that would reduce our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests, the issuance of sizable amounts of debt and the incurrence of contingent liabilities. In summary, integrating acquired companies involves a number of special risks. Our failure to overcome such risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and future results of operations. Further, we may conclude that the divestiture of a troubled business will satisfy the best interests of our stockholders. Any divesting transaction could result in a material loss for us.\nOur failure to protect our management information systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur computer systems face the threat of unauthorized access, computer hackers, viruses, malicious code, cyberattacks, phishing and other security incursions and system disruptions, including attempts to improperly access our confidential and proprietary information as well as the confidential and proprietary information of our customers and other business partners. A party who circumvents our security measures, or those of our clients, contractors or other vendors, could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information, improperly manipulate data, or cause damage or interruptions to systems.\nVarious privacy and security laws in the US and abroad, including the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d), require us to protect sensitive and confidential information and data from disclosure and we are bound by our client and other contracts, as well as our own business practices, to protect confidential and proprietary information and data (whether it be ours or a third party\u2019s information entrusted to us) from unauthorized disclosure. We believe that we have deployed industry-accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information retained within our information systems, including compliance with GDPR, specifically at APC. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent unanticipated security breaches. There can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats. Further, as these security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to devote additional resources to protect, prevent, detect and respond against such threats. We do believe that our business represents a low value target for cyberterrorists as we are not a company in the high technology space and we do not maintain large files of sensitive or confidential personal information. However, we do maintain a cybersecurity insurance policy to help protect ourselves from various types of losses relating to computer security breaches.\n- 21 -\nWe are fortunate to report that we are unaware of any meaningful security breaches at any of our business locations. Nonetheless, any significant breach of our information security could damage our reputation, result in litigation and/or regulatory fines and penalties, or have other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nShould our management information systems become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. We are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems, some of which are hosted by third party providers, in order to operate effectively. We may experience system availability disruptions that may or may not occur as the result of planned procedures. Unplanned interruptions may include natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar cybersecurity intrusions as discussed above. Any of these or other events could delay or prevent necessary operations (including the processing of transactions and the reporting of financial results). While we believe that our reasonable safeguards will protect us from serious disruptions in the availability of our information technology assets, these safeguards may not be sufficient. We may also be required to expend significant resources to protect against or alleviate damage caused by systems interruptions and delays.\nWe do evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor-supported products, to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. The implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. The unavailability of the information systems or the failure of the systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs, causing our business to suffer. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems could disrupt the conduct of our business in a meaningful manner, possibly causing material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nChanges in our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the US and several foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required in order to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes for each quarterly and annual reporting period. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realization of deferred tax assets, changes in uncertain tax positions and changes in our tax strategies.\nA change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our pre-tax earnings. The results of current or future income tax return audits could result in unfavorable adjustments to the amounts of income taxes previously recorded and/or paid. Any such future event or determination related to income taxes could have a material impact on our net earnings and cash flows from operations.\nWe are periodically audited by income tax authorities. Currently, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) is conducting examinations of the amendments to our federal consolidated tax returns for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017 with a focus on the significant amounts of research and development credits claimed by us in the amended income tax returns for each year. During Fiscal 2019, we completed a detailed review of the activities of our engineering staff on major EPC services projects in order to identify and quantify the amounts of research and development credits that may be available to reduce prior year income taxes. This study focused on project costs incurred during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018. Based on the results of the study, management identified and estimated significant amounts of income tax benefits that were not previously recognized in our operating results for any prior year reporting period. We recorded an aggregate income tax benefit in the amount of $16.6 million related to the research and development credits during Fiscal 2019.\nWe evaluate our income tax positions using the more-likely-than-not threshold in order to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized. We do not anticipate any significant changes to the income tax benefit recorded; however, the IRS is conducting examinations, as noted above, and, if previously recognized tax positions no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, the related benefit amounts will be derecognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met, which could materially and adversely affect our future financial condition and operating results.\n- 22 -\nForeign currency risks could have an adverse impact on our revenues, earnings, net assets and backlog.\nCertain of the contracts of APC subject us to foreign currency risk, particularly when project revenues are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. In addition, our cash balances, though predominately held in US dollars, may consist of different currencies at various points in time in order to execute our projects globally and meet transactional requirements. In the future, we may attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risk by obtaining contract provisions that protect us from foreign currency fluctuations and/or by using derivatives as hedging instruments. However, these actions may not always eliminate all foreign currency risk and, as a result, our profitability on certain projects could be adversely affected.\nRevenues, costs and earnings of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the US dollar are translated into dollars for consolidated reporting purposes. Our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are subject to currency fluctuations when measured period to period for financial reporting purposes. In addition, the US dollar value of APC\u2019s project backlog may from time to time increase or decrease due to foreign currency volatility. The future amounts of revenues and earnings of foreign subsidiaries could be affected by foreign currency volatility. If the dollar depreciates against a foreign subsidiary\u2019s non-US dollar functional currency, we will report greater consolidated revenues, earnings, net assets and backlog amounts in dollars than we would if the dollar appreciates against the same foreign currency or if there is no change in the exchange rate. During Fiscal 2020, the US dollar appreciated against the Euro, which is the functional currency of APC. There can be no assurance that the dollar will not appreciate against the Euro to a greater extent in future reporting periods which would reduce the amounts of APC\u2019s revenues, earnings and net assets included in our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amount of our project backlog.\nA weaker British pound compared to the US dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of our UK contracts, denominated in the British pound, to be translated into fewer dollars. Despite Brexit fears, the British pound strengthened against the Euro and depreciated only slightly against the US dollar during Fiscal 2020. Future volatility in exchange rates may occur as the UK exits from the EU. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our international operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws.\nThe US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We may operate in parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our personnel concerning anti-bribery laws and issues, and we also inform our partners, subcontractors, suppliers and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with anti-bribery law requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance.\nWe cannot assure that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or others. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if such litigation or investigations demonstrate ultimately that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could divert management\u2019s attention away from other aspects of our business.\nOur continued success requires us to retain and hire talented personnel.\nDuring Fiscal 2020, we reached agreement with William F. Griffin, the co-founder of GPS, on the terms of the change in his role from Chief Executive Officer to Non-Executive Chairman of GPS, effective November 15, 2019. The change in Mr. Griffin\u2019s role was an important step in the leadership transition that was planned to occur at GPS.\nIts Co-Presidents, Charles Collins IV and Terrence Trebilcock, have assumed policy-making leadership roles at GPS and are now included among our named executive officers. Mr. Griffin will continue to advise, to mentor, to support, and to engage in various key activities at GPS as needed. The change in role allowed Mr. Griffin to provide valuable guidance to APC\u2019s management on the TeesREP project and other matters. In addition, Mr. Griffin remains a key contributing member of our Board of Directors. We believe that our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service and performance of the members of our current executive team and the senior management members of our businesses, including Messrs. Griffin, Collins and Trebilcock, and John Roberts, the chief executive officer and founder of TRC.\n- 23 -\nUndoubtedly, unforeseen future changes in our management will occur. Therefore, we cannot be certain that any key executive or manager will continue in such capacity while performing at a high level for any particular period of time, nor can we be certain that events will permit us to complete smooth management transitions should they occur. Our ability to operate productively and profitably, particularly in the power industry, may be limited by the sudden loss of key personnel or our inability to attract, employ, retain and train skilled personnel necessary to meet our future requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain experienced management teams and adequately skilled groups of employees necessary to execute our long-term construction contracts successfully and to support our future growth strategy. The loss of key personnel, the inability to complete management transitions without significant loss of effectiveness, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees in the future could negatively impact our ability to manage our business in the future.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nOur acquisition strategy may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may make future acquisitions of other businesses that require the use of cash and issuances of common stock. To the extent that we intend to use cash for any acquisition, we may be required to raise additional equity and/or obtain debt financing. Equity financing may result in dilution for our then current stockholders. Stock issuances and financing, if obtained, may not be on terms favorable to us and could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders at the time(s) of these transactions.\nFuture stock option exercises and restricted stock issuances may dilute the ownership of the Company\u2019s current stockholders.\nAs of January 31, 2020, the closing market price for a share of our common stock was $42.11. The average of the monthly closing prices for our common stock for Fiscal 2020 was $42.79 per share. During Fiscal 2020, the exercise of stock options by our employees and directors resulted in the issuance of 61,100 shares of our common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $26.67 per share. As of January 31, 2020, there were outstanding options to purchase 1,271,000 shares of our common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $44.83 per share, including 420,000 shares related to in-the-money exercisable stock options with a weighted average purchase price of $31.14 per share. Future exercises of options to purchase shares of common stock at prices below prevailing market prices may result in ownership dilution for current stockholders.\nFurther, in April 2019 and 2018, we awarded performance-based restricted stock units to two senior executives covering up to 36,000 shares of common stock at each date plus a number of shares to be determined based on the amount of cash dividends deemed paid on shares earned pursuant to the awards. The release of the stock restrictions will depend on the total shareholder return performance of the Company\u2019s common stock measured against the performance of a peer-group of common stocks over three-year periods.\nOur officers, directors and certain unaffiliated stockholders have substantial control over the Company.\nAs of January 31, 2020, our executive officers and directors as a group owned approximately 8.2% of our voting shares including an aggregate of 546,328 shares of common stock that may be purchased upon the exercise of stock options held by our executive officers and directors (and deemed exercisable at January 31, 2020), a total of 327,411 shares of common stock beneficially owned by Rainer H.

We paid four regular quarterly dividends of $0.25 per share for a total of $1.00 per share during Fiscal 2020 and 2019, a regular dividend of $1.00 per share during Fiscal 2018, regular and special cash dividends of $0.70 and $0.30 per share, respectively, for a total of $1.00 per share during Fiscal 2017, a regular cash dividend in the amount of $0.70 per share during Fiscal 2016, and we paid special cash dividends during earlier years. However, there can be no assurance that the evaluations of our board of directors will result in the payment of cash dividends in the future.\n- 24 -\nAs our common stock is thinly traded at times, the stock price may be volatile and investors may have difficulty disposing of their investments at prevailing market prices.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the NYSE stock exchange and trades under the symbol AGX.
