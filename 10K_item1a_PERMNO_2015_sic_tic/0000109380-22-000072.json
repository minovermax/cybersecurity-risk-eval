RISK FACTORS\nWe generate revenue and grow our businesses by taking prudent and appropriately priced risks. These risks are outlined in our Risk Management Framework. Our Board has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Risk Oversight Committee (\u201cROC\u201d), and appointed an Enterprise Risk Management Committee (\u201cERMC\u201d) to oversee and implement the Risk Management Framework. The ERMC is comprised of senior management and is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer. Our largest risk exposure has traditionally come from the acceptance of credit risk inherent in extensions of credit to customers. In addition to credit risk, these committees also monitor the following risk areas: market and interest rate risk; liquidity risk; strategic and business risk; operational risk; technology risk; cyber risk; capital/financial reporting risk; legal/compliance risk (including regulatory risk); and reputational risk, as outlined in our risk taxonomy. We have developed policies, procedures, and controls designed to address these risks, but there can be no certainty that our actions will be effective to prevent or limit the effects of these risks on our business or performance. Although not comprehensive, risk factors that are material to us are described below.\nCredit Risk\nCredit quality has adversely affected us in the past and may adversely affect us in the future.\nCredit risk is one of our most significant risks. A decline in the strength of the U.S. economy in general or the local economies in which we conduct operations could result in, among other things, deterioration in credit quality and/or reduced demand for credit, including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan and investment portfolios, an increase in charge-offs, and an increase in the allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d).\nWe have concentrations of risk in our loan portfolio, including loans secured by real estate, oil and gas-related lending, and leveraged and enterprise value lending, which may have unique risk characteristics that may adversely affect our results.\nConcentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect us. Concentration risk across our loan and investment securities portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to us due to similar exposures between the two asset types. Counterparty risk arising from derivative or securities financing transactions could also pose additional credit risk.\nWe engage in commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) term and construction and land acquisition and development lending, primarily in our Western states footprint. We also have a concentration in oil and gas-related lending, primarily in Texas, as well as concentrations in leveraged and enterprise value lending across our entire footprint. These concentrations are subject to specific risks, including governmental and social responses to environmental issues and climate change, volatility, and potential significant and prolonged declines in collateral values and activity levels. We may have other unidentified concentrated or correlated risks in our loan portfolio.\nOur business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a specific geographic region of the U.S.\nWe provide a wide range of banking products and related services through our local management teams and unique brands in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. At December 31, 2021, loan balances associated with our banking operations in Utah/Idaho, Texas, and California comprised 77% of the commercial lending portfolio, 73% of the CRE lending portfolio, and 71% of the consumer lending portfolio. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial performance depends largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. Accordingly, deterioration in economic conditions, such as that caused by climate change or natural disasters, may specifically affect these states, and could result in higher credit losses and significantly affect our consolidated operations and financial results.\nFor information about how we manage credit risk, see \u201cCredit Risk Management\u201d on page 48 in MD&A.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\nMarket and Interest Rate Risk\nWe could be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions.\nAdverse economic conditions negatively affect our business, including our loan and investment portfolios, capital levels, results of operations, and financial condition. Prolonged periods of slow growth, significant inflationary pressures, volatility and disruption in financial markets, continued uncertainties and disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic (including the emergence of new variants), and other adverse economic conditions could lead to lower demand for loans, higher credit losses, and lower fee income, among other effects.\nFailure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect our results.\nNet interest income is the largest component of our revenue. Interest rate risk is managed by the Asset Liability Management Committee. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase our risk. These factors include changes in the prevailing interest rate environment, competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits, adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources, and volatile market interest rates resulting from general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular the FRB. As interest rates on earning assets decline, our cost of funds may not decline commensurately. Conversely, rising rates may result in our cost of funds increasing more than expected. Some components of our balance sheet are very sensitive to rising and falling rates.\nInterest rates on our financial instruments are subject to change based on developments related to LIBOR, which could adversely impact our revenue, expenses, and value of those financial instruments.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) is being phased out globally, and U.S. banking regulators instructed banks to cease entering into new lending arrangements using LIBOR no later than December 31, 2021, and migrate to alternative reference rates no later than June 2023.\nThe adoption of alternative reference rates continues to evolve in the marketplace. The market transition away from LIBOR is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the value of, our floating-rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments indexed to LIBOR, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s dominant role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022require consent from counterparties regarding the amendment of certain outstanding contracts indexed to LIBOR;\n\u2022result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in financial instruments; and\n\u2022require the transition to, or development of, appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmarks.\nThe manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.\nFor information about how we manage the transition from LIBOR, interest rate risk, and market risk, see \u201cInterest Rate and Market Risk Management\u201d on page 57 in MD&A.\nLiquidity Risk\nWe and the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies.\nOur ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile. This access is affected by the ratings assigned to us by rating agencies. The rates we pay on our securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that we and our securities receive from recognized rating agencies. Ratings downgrades to\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\nus or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our liquidity position, financial condition or the market prices of our securities.\nChanges in sources of liquidity and capital and liquidity requirements may limit our operations and potential growth.\nOur primary source of liquidity is deposits from our customers, which may be impacted by market-related forces and a variety of other events. Liquidity requirements and sources are also subject to comprehensive supervision by the OCC and the FDIC.\nFor information about how we manage liquidity risk, see \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d on page 62 in MD&A.\nStrategic and Business Risk\nProblems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on us.\nThe soundness and stability of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing, or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as \u201csystemic risk\u201d and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms, and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore, could adversely affect us.\nWe may not be able to hire or retain qualified personnel or effectively promote our corporate culture, and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of changes in the workplace, marketplace, economy, and regulatory environment.\nOur ability to execute our strategy, provide services, and remain competitive may suffer if we are unable to recruit or retain qualified people, or if the costs of employee compensation and benefits increase substantially. Bank regulatory agencies have published regulations and guidance that limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees. These regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Some of these limitations may not apply to institutions with which we compete for talent, in particular, as we are more frequently competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other entities that may not have the same limitations on compensation as we do. If we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely or materially affected.\nOur ability to retain talent may also be adversely affected by changes in the economy and workforce trends, priorities, migration, modes of delivery and other considerations, such as the increased ability of employees to work from anywhere in many industries. This growth in remote work and other changing priorities and benefits has led to an increase in compensation and related expenses and workplace challenges, such as fewer opportunities for face-to-face interactions, training and mentoring new employees, promoting a cohesive corporate culture, and increased competition for experienced labor, especially in high-demand and highly-skilled categories. Inflationary pressures have also increased our compensation costs and are likely to continue to do so in the future.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, significant changes that include, among other things, organizational restructurings, efficiency initiatives, and replacement or upgrades of technology systems to improve our control environment and operating efficiency. The ultimate success and completion of these changes, and their effects on us, may vary significantly from initial planning, which could materially adversely affect us.\nOver the last several years, we have completed numerous improvement projects, including the merger of our bank holding company into the Bank; combining the legal charters of our seven affiliate banks into one; consolidating 15 loan operations sites into two; replacing our core loan systems; upgrading our accounting systems; installing a credit origination work flow system; streamlining our small business and retail lending, mortgage, wealth management and foreign exchange businesses; and investing in data quality and information security.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\nOngoing investments continue in a variety of strategic projects designed to improve our products and services and to simplify how we do business. These projects include the replacement of our core deposit systems, the development of a collection of customer-facing digital capabilities such as improved online and mobile banking applications and services, and the enhancement of the online treasury management portal for our business customers. These initiatives and other changes continue to be implemented and are in various stages of completion. By their very nature, projections of duration, cost, expected savings, expected efficiencies, and related items are subject to change and significant variability. There can be no certainty that we will achieve the expected benefits or other intended results associated with these projects.\nOperational Risk\nCatastrophic events including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, floods, prolonged drought, and pandemics may adversely affect us and the general economy, financial and capital markets, and specific industries.\nThe occurrence of pandemics, natural disasters, and other catastrophic events could adversely affect our operations. We have significant operations and number of customers in Utah, Texas, California, and other regions where natural and other disasters have and are likely to continue to occur. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, floods, prolonged droughts, and other weather-related events, which may become more frequent and intense. These types of catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy, our business and customers, and have posed physical risks to our property. In addition, catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on us and our customers. A significant catastrophic event could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur operations could be disrupted by the effects of our new and ongoing projects and initiatives.\nWe may encounter significant operational disruption arising from our numerous projects and initiatives. These may include significant time delays, cost overruns, loss of key people, technological problems, and processing failures. We may also experience operational disruptions due to capacity constraints, service level failures and inadequate performance, the level of concentration, replacement costs, and other risks arising from our dependence on third-party vendors. Any or all of these issues could result in disruptions to our systems, processes, control environment, procedures, and employees. The ultimate effect of any significant disruption to our business could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could materially affect us, including our control environment, operating efficiency, and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.\nBecause of their inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. A failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators, and investors may have of us and adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nWe could be adversely affected by internal and external fraud schemes.\nAttempts to commit fraud by both internal and external actors are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and may go undetected by the systems and procedures we have in place to monitor our operations. We have suffered losses in the past as a result of these schemes and will not be able to identify, prevent, or otherwise mitigate all instances of fraud in the future that have the potential to result in material losses.\nWe use models in the management of the Bank. There is risk that these models are inaccurate in various ways, which can cause us to make suboptimal decisions.\nWe rely on models in the management of the Bank. For example, we use models to inform our estimate of the allowance for credit losses, to manage interest rate and liquidity risk, to project stress losses in various segments of our loan and investment portfolios, and to project net revenue under stress. Models are inherently imperfect for a number of reasons and cannot perfectly predict outcomes. Management decisions based in part on such models, therefore, may be suboptimal.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\nWe outsource various operations to third-party vendors which could adversely impact our business and operational performance.\nWe rely on various vendors to perform operational activities to conduct our business. Although there are benefits in entering into these relationships, there are risks associated with such activities. Our operational controls and third-party management programs may not provide adequate oversight and control, and inadequate performance by third parties can adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and conduct our business. Replacing or finding alternatives for vendors who do not perform adequately can be difficult and costly, and may also adversely impact our customers and other operations, particularly when circumstances require us to make changes under tight time constraints. Many of our vendors have experienced adverse effects upon operations, supply chains, personnel, and businesses arising from COVID-19 and other events, all of which can impact our operations as well.\nFor information about how we manage operational risk, see \u201cOperational, Technology, and Cyber Risk Management\u201d on page 65 in MD&A.\nTechnology Risk\nWe could be adversely affected by our ability to develop, adopt, and implement technology advancements.\nOur ability to remain competitive is increasingly dependent upon our ability to maintain critical technological capabilities, and to identify and develop new, value-added products for existing and future customers. These technological competitive pressures arise from both traditional banking and non-traditional sources. Larger banks may have greater resources and economies of scale attendant to maintaining existing capabilities and developing digital and other technologies. Fintechs and other technology platform companies continue to emerge and compete with traditional financial institutions across a wide variety of products and services. The expansion of blockchain technologies and the potential creation and adoption of central bank digital currencies present similar risks. Our failure to remain technologically competitive could impede our time to market and reduce customer satisfaction, product accessibility, and relevance.\nWe could be adversely impacted by system vulnerabilities, failures, or outages impacting operations and customer services such as online and mobile banking.\nWe rely on hundreds of information technology systems that work together in supporting internal operations and customer services. Vulnerabilities in, or a failure or outage of, one or many of these systems could impact the ability to perform internal operations and provide services to customers such as online banking, mobile banking, remote deposit capture, and other services dependent on system processing. These risks increase as systems and software approach the end of their useful life or require more frequent updates and modifications. We cannot guarantee that such occurrences will not have a significant operational or customer impact.\nFor information regarding risks associated with the replacement or upgrades of our core technology systems, see \u201cStrategic and Business Risk\u201d on page 14 in Risk Factors. For information about how we manage technology risk, see \u201cOperational, Technology, and Cyber Risk Management\u201d on page 65 in MD&A.\nCyber Risk\nWe are subject to a variety of system failure and cyber security risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Information security risks for large financial institutions have increased significantly in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and internet connections (e.g., Internet of Things, the internet, and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions) and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists, and other external third parties.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\nThird parties, including vendors and suppliers, also present operational and information security risks to us, including security breaches or failures of their own systems. In incidents involving third parties, we may not be informed timely of any effect on our services or our data, or be able to participate in any investigation, notification, or remediation that occurs as a result. Any such incidents may have a material adverse effect upon our operations, reputation, customers, and services. The possibility of third-party or employee error, failure to follow security procedures, or malfeasance also presents these risks.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we will be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities. We, and our third-party vendors, have experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past that have not had material impact to our data, customers, or operations, but there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption, or significant security breach will not occur in the future, or, if any future occurrences will be adequately addressed. It is impossible to determine the severity or potential effects of these events with any certainty, but any such breach could result in material adverse consequences for us and our customers.\nSystem enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities and our ability to implement them in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nFor information about how we manage cyber risk, see \u201cOperational, Technology, and Cyber Risk Management\u201d on page 65 in MD&A.\nCapital/Financial Reporting Risk\nInternal stress testing and capital management, as well as provisions of the National Bank Act and OCC regulations, may limit our ability to increase dividends, repurchase shares of our stock, and access the capital markets.\nWe are required to submit stress tests to the OCC because we have assets in excess of $10 billion, and we continue to utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions. The stress testing and other applicable regulatory requirements may, among other things, require us to increase our capital levels, limit our dividends or other capital distributions to shareholders, modify our business strategies, or decrease our exposure to various asset classes.\nUnder the National Bank Act and OCC regulations, certain capital transactions, including share repurchases, are subject to the approval of the OCC. These requirements may limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments.\nEconomic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to us.\nWe must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios, as required by our banking regulators, which can change depending upon general economic conditions, as well as the particular conditions, risk profiles, and our growth plans. Compliance with capital requirements may limit our ability to expand and has required, and may require, us to raise additional capital. These uncertainties and risks, including those created by legislative and regulatory uncertainties, may increase our cost of capital and other financing costs.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\nWe could be adversely affected by accounting, financial reporting, and regulatory compliance risk.\nWe are exposed to accounting, financial reporting, and regulatory compliance risk. We use a number of complex financial products and services for our own capital, funding, investment and risk management needs, and also provide them to our customers. Estimates, judgments, and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services. Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions. The level of regulatory compliance oversight continues to be heightened. Therefore, identification, interpretation, and implementation of complex and changing accounting standards, as well as compliance with regulatory requirements, pose an ongoing risk.\nThe value of our goodwill may decline in the future.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $1 billion of goodwill that was allocated to Amegy Bank (\u201cAmegy\u201d), California Bank & Trust (\u201cCB&T\u201d) and Zions Bank. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value, we may have to take a charge related to the impairment of our goodwill. Such a charge could result from, among other factors, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows or a sustained decline in the price of our common stock.\nFor information about how we manage capital, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d on page 66 in MD&A.\nLegal/Compliance Risk\nLaws and regulations applicable to us and the financial services industry impose significant limitations on our business activities and subject us to increased regulation and additional costs.\nWe, and the entire financial services industry, have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial costs related to personnel, systems, consulting, and other activities in order to comply with banking regulations. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d on page 6 for further information about the regulations applicable to us and the financial services industry generally.\nRegulators, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures, and other governing or consultative bodies continue to enact rules, laws, and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies, including laws that are designed to promote, protect, or penalize certain activities or industries and their access to financial services. We are, and may in the future become, subject to these laws by offering our products and services to certain industries or in certain locations. The nature of these laws and regulations and their effect on our future business and performance cannot be predicted.\nThere can be no assurance that any or all of these regulatory changes or actions will ultimately be enacted. However, if enacted, some of these proposals could adversely affect us by, among other things: impacting after-tax returns earned by financial services firms in general; limiting our ability to grow; increasing FDIC insurance assessments, taxes or fees on our funding or activities; limiting the range of products and services that we could offer; and requiring us to raise capital at inopportune times.\nPolitical developments may also result in substantial changes in tax, international trade, immigration, and other policies. The extent and timing of any such changes are uncertain, as are the potential direct and indirect impacts, whether beneficial or adverse. Regulations and laws may be modified or repealed, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us and our subsidiaries.\nThe ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which, if any, may be enacted.\nWe could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings.\nWe are subject to risks associated with legal claims, litigation, and regulatory and other government proceedings. Our exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers, counterparties, and others arising from the past or current economic environments, more frequent claims and actions resulting from fraud schemes perpetrated by or involving our customers, new regulations promulgated under recently enacted statutes, the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies, and enforcement and legal\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\nactions against banking organizations. Any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations, financial condition or ability to conduct our business, including adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties (e.g., civil money penalties under applicable banking laws), injunctions, restrictions on our business activities, or other relief. Our involvement in any such matters, even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations, have been increasing dramatically. This has affected and will continue to adversely affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage for certain claims and significantly increase our deductibles and premiums associated with the coverage. In addition, any enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and CRA ratings, which may restrict or limit our activities.\nThe corporate and securities laws applicable to us are not as well-developed as those applicable to a state-chartered corporation, which may impact our ability to effect corporate transactions in an efficient and optimal manner.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act, and related regulations are administered by the OCC. As to securities laws, the OCC maintains its own securities offering framework applicable to national banks and their securities offerings, and our compliance with the Exchange Act is governed and enforced by the OCC.\nState corporate codes, including that of Utah, are widely recognized, updated by legislative action from time-to-time, and are often based on and influenced by model statutes. The federal securities law regime established by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the SEC\u2019s extensive and well-developed framework thereunder are widely used by public companies. The OCC statutory and regulatory frameworks have been used by publicly-traded banking organizations relatively rarely and are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law frameworks applicable to other public corporations. While certain specific risks associated with operating under these frameworks are described below, unless and until these frameworks are further developed and established over time, the uncertainty of how these frameworks might apply to any given corporate or securities matters may prevent us from effecting transactions in an efficient and optimal manner or perhaps at all.\nDifferences between the National Bank Act and state law requirements regarding mergers could hinder our ability to execute acquisitions as efficiently and advantageously as bank holding companies or other financial institutions.\nUnlike state corporate law, the National Bank Act requires shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for exceptions in the case of various \u201cminor\u201d mergers, such as a parent company\u2019s merger with a subsidiary or an acquirer\u2019s merger with an unaffiliated entity in which the shares issued by the acquirer do not exceed a designated percentage. The National Bank Act and related regulations may also complicate the structuring of certain nonbank acquisitions.\nThese differences could adversely affect the ability of the Bank and other banks registered under the National Bank Act to efficiently consummate acquisition transactions. In addition, such differences could make us less competitive as a potential acquirer in certain circumstances given that our acquisition proposal may be conditioned on shareholder approval while our competitors\u2019 proposals will not have such a condition.\nWe are subject to restrictions on permissible activities that would limit the types of business we may conduct and that may make acquisitions of other financial companies more challenging.\nUnder applicable laws and regulations, bank holding companies and banks are generally limited to business activities and investments that are related to banking or are financial in nature. The range of permissible financial activities is set forth in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and is more limited for banks than for bank holding company organizations. The differences relate mainly to insurance underwriting (but not insurance agency activities) and merchant banking (but not broker-dealer and investment advisory activities). The fact that we do not have a bank holding company could make future acquisitions of financial institutions with such operations more challenging.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\nReputational Risk\nWe are presented with various reputational risk issues that could stem from operational, regulatory, compliance, and legal risks.\nAny of the aforementioned risks may give rise to adverse publicity and other expressions of negative public opinion, increased regulatory scrutiny, and damaged relationships among other reputational risks.\nOther Risk\nOur business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created economic, financial, and social disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the direct and indirect impact on our employees, customers, communities, counterparties, service providers, other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. The pandemic is likely to continue to affect consumer confidence and business activity generally, including loan demand, deposit levels, and the market for other financial products or services. Disruptions in supply chains have in some instances adversely affected our ability to procure equipment and materials for our employees and facilities in a timely fashion and may increase our costs for the same. Pressures on the cost and availability of labor have also negatively affected us and many of our customers. These disruptions are likely to continue as the pandemic evolves.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Uncertainties arising from evolving political and governmental responses to the pandemic, such as vaccine and testing mandates and other workplace policies and requirements, will also continue to impact our business and results, particularly as more of our employees return to our physical locations. The long-term effects of the pandemic and the increasing interest in remote-work environments may reduce our need for physical office space while negatively impacting our ability to sell or sublease any excess space or selling and lease termination expenses associated with our leased and owned properties.\nESG-related developments could lead or require us to restrict or modify some of our business activities.\nESG expectations of investors and regulators could, over time, lead us to restrict or modify some of our business practices. In addition, our business practices could be adversely affected by laws and regulations enacted or promulgated by federal, state, and local governments that relate to environmental and social issues. For example, in 2021 and 2022, certain states passed or considered passing laws prohibiting financial institutions from restricting the services that they provide to certain types of businesses if the institutions also conduct business with governmental entities in such states. Depending on how these laws are worded and implemented, they could adversely affect our ability to manage risk.", "PERMNO": 84129, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ZION"}
