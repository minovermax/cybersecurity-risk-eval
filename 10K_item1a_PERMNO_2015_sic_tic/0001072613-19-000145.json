{"cik": "764579", "company": "CAS MEDICAL SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces many risks. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. You should consider the following risks, as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our common stock.\nOur merger with Edwards could be delayed or fail to close, which could adversely affect our financial condition and could negatively impact our stock price.\nOn February 11, 2019, we entered into a Merger Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to be merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edwards. We will incur significant transaction costs relating to the Merger, including legal, financial advisory, and other expenses. In general, these expenses are payable by us whether or not the Merger is completed. If the Merger is not completed under specific circumstances provided in the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay Edwards a termination fee of $3.5 million or reimburse Edwards for certain expenses up to $1 million. The payment of such transaction costs or termination fees and expense would have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we could be subject to litigation in the event the Merger is not consummated, which could subject us to significant liability for damages and result in the incurrence of substantial legal fees. The current price of our stock may reflect an assumption that the pending Merger will occur, and failure to complete the Merger could result in a decline in our stock price.\nIn addition, the Merger presents the following additional risks and uncertainties for the Company:\n\u25cf\nthe occurrence of any event, change, or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement;\n\u25cf\nthe outcome of any legal proceeding that has been or may be instituted against CASMED and others relating to the Merger Agreement;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to complete the Merger due to the failure to obtain stockholder approval, the failure to obtain regulatory approvals, or the failure to satisfy other conditions to consummation of the Merger;\n\u25cf\nthe failure of the Merger to close for any other reason;\n\u25cf\nrisks that the proposed transactions disrupt current business plans and operations and the potential difficulties in attracting and retaining senior management or employees as a result of the Merger;\n\u25cf\nbusiness uncertainty and contractual restrictions during the pendency of the Merger;\n\u25cf\nthe fact that, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are unable to solicit certain other acquisition proposals during the pendency of the Merger;\n\u25cf\nthe diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u25cf\nthe effect of the announcement of the Merger on our customer and supplier relationships, operating results, and business generally; and\n\u25cf\nthe timing of the completion of the Merger and the impact of the merger on our indebtedness, capital resources, cash requirements, profitability, management resources, and liquidity.\n- 12 -\nWe have a recent history of net losses and are subject to risks regarding future liquidity.\nWe have experienced operating losses during our last ten fiscal years. The loss from continuing operations was approximately $5,961,000 for the 2018 calendar year, and the accumulated deficit was approximately $49,388,000 as of December 31, 2018. We do not anticipate a return to operating profits in the near-term, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to improve our results of operations in the near-term or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had cash-on-hand and amounts available under its Loan Agreement totaling $5,272,000. As such, our ordinary short-term capital needs are expected to be met from cash-on-hand and borrowings available from the revolving line-of-credit under our Loan Agreement, which was unused as of December 31, 2018. Management also believes its cash balances and available borrowings are sufficient to support operations through March 31, 2020. Management further believes that, given the Company's current and expected rate of cash consumption over the next 12 months together with the principal repayments required under its Loan Agreement, it should, nonetheless, if the merger transaction with Edwards is not completed, take action to improve its liquidity until such time that the Company can generate positive cash flow from operations. Management estimates it will not achieve positive cash flow until late 2020. Such actions to enhance liquidity may include seeking further changes in its debt instruments (including waivers, modifications, and/or replacement of current agreements), reducing otherwise planned expenditures and operating expenses, or raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities.\nCash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, including changing market conditions; market acceptance of the FORE-SIGHT system; and U.S. government regulations, including the continued imposition of substantial tariffs, and other trade barriers imposed by foreign governments on our exports, and the loss of one or more key customers. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in modifying or refinancing our debt instruments or raising additional capital if the need arises. The failure to raise any necessary additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are a small company in a highly competitive industry.\nCompetition from other medical device companies, diversified healthcare companies, and research and academic institutions is intense and expected to increase. Many companies engaged in the medical device sector have substantially greater financial and other resources, as well as greater development capabilities, and substantially greater experience in testing products, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing, marketing, and distributing medical devices than we do.\nOther companies may succeed in developing and commercializing products earlier than we do. In addition to competing with universities and other research institutions in the development of products, technologies, and processes, the Company may compete with other companies in acquiring rights to products or technologies from universities. Also, the medical device market is experiencing increasing customer concentration, due to the emergence of large purchasing groups and hospital systems. We cannot assure you that we will develop products that are more effective or achieve greater market acceptance than competitive products or that our competitors will not succeed in developing products and technologies that are more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our products and technologies less competitive or obsolete. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully sell to large purchasing groups, which are increasingly looking to suppliers that can provide a broader range of products than we currently offer.\nOur business is almost entirely dependent on our FORE-SIGHT tissue oximetry products.\nSales of our FORE-SIGHT tissue oximetry products represented nearly all of our net sales from continuing operations for both 2018 and 2017. Our business strategy in recent years has been to transform CASMED from a low-margin commodity capital medical equipment business into a high-growth, high-margin medical disposables business. A key aspect of this strategy has been to focus on the growth of our FORE-SIGHT tissue oximetry products, while exiting or de-emphasizing our other various lines of business. However, this strategy results in additional concentration risks. In the absence of significant other lines of business, we are subject to a greater degree on the success of our FORE-SIGHT tissue oximetry products. Any adverse business or other events relating to our FORE-SIGHT tissue oximetry products, including the inability to obtain sufficient levels of product from our overseas or U.S. based suppliers due to manufacturing disruptions, transportation delays, new or substantial customs or tariffs on the manufacture of foreign goods, or other risks as described elsewhere in this Item 1A, will result in a proportionately greater potential negative impact on our business and financial condition.\n- 13 -\nOur business is impacted by customer concentration.\nThe Company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 16% and 14% of sales from continuing operations in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The loss of significant customers, especially in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur operations depend on a small number of key suppliers.\nA significant percentage of our product components are purchased from a few suppliers located outside of the United States. Our suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing due to a variety of reasons, including failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, equipment malfunctions, labor shortages, or environmental factors. In addition, we purchase both raw materials used in our products and finished goods from various suppliers and may have to rely on a single-source supplier for certain components of our products where there are no alternatives available. Although we anticipate that we have adequate sources of supply and/or inventory of these components to handle our production needs for the foreseeable future, if we are unable to secure on a timely basis sufficient quantities of the products we use for manufacture or for sale, if we encounter delays or contractual or other difficulties in our relationships with these suppliers, or if we cannot find suppliers at an acceptable cost, then the manufacture or sale of our products may be disrupted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are devoting substantial resources to the development and marketing of our tissue oximetry products.\nWe expect to devote a significant amount of resources to continue the development and marketing of our FORE-SIGHT tissue oximetry products. We believe that substantial additional resources are required to further penetrate the markets for these products. Such investments include further research and development, involving significant expenditures for clinical studies, equipment for placements at customer sites, further expansion of our selling organization, marketing expenditures, and general working capital requirements. Due to our limited financial resources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these endeavors.\nThe sale of our products may result in significant product liability exposure.\nAs a manufacturer of medical equipment and products, we face product liability claims. We maintain product liability insurance in an aggregate amount of $5 million. We cannot assure you that this insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any product liability claims that occur in the future or that product liability insurance will continue to be available at reasonable prices. Any product liability judgments or settlements in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we cannot protect our proprietary technology or if we infringe on the proprietary technology of others.\nOur proprietary technology aids our ability to compete effectively with other companies in certain markets in which we compete. Although we have been awarded or have filed applications for numerous patents, these patents may not fully protect our technology or competitive position. Further, our competitors may apply for and obtain patents that will restrict our ability to make and sell our products.\nOur competitors may intentionally infringe our patents. Third-parties may also assert infringement claims against us. Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. The defense and prosecution of patent suits are both costly and time-consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. Such proceedings can be extremely expensive, and their outcome very unpredictable.\nAn adverse outcome in the defense of a patent suit could cause us to lose proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities to third-parties, or require us to license rights from third-parties or to cease selling our products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology that others may independently develop or otherwise obtain access to.\nOur inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies could negatively affect our sales and earnings.\n- 14 -\nCost-containment efforts of our customers, purchasing groups, third-party payors, and governmental organizations could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nMany existing and potential customers for our products within the United States have become members of group purchase organizations (GPOs) and integrated delivery networks (IDNs) in an effort to reduce costs. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. GPOs and IDNs typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding process. In addition, competitors often approach GPO's and IDN's with attractive discounts for the purchase of bundles of products offered by those competitors that may also include tissue oximetry. Bids are generally solicited from multiple manufacturers with the intention of driving down pricing. Due to the highly competitive nature of the GPO and IDN contracting processes, we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major GPOs and IDNs and we may lose customers as they enter into contracts with our competitors. Furthermore, the increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products, thereby reducing our profitability.\nThe members of such groups may choose to purchase from our competitors due to the price or quality offered by such competitors, or due to additional or \"bundled\" products that can be offered by our competitors to these same IDN's and GPO's. Any of these actions could result in a decline in our sales and profitability.\nDistributors of our products outside of the United States and hospital purchasers also negotiate terms of sale aggressively to increase their profitability. Reductions in our average selling prices or failure to negotiate arrangements having advantageous pricing and other terms of sale could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOutside of the United States, we have also experienced pricing pressure from centralized governmental healthcare authorities and increased efforts by such authorities to lower healthcare costs. We frequently are required to engage in competitive bidding for the sale of our products to governmental purchasing agents. Our failure to offer acceptable prices to these customers could adversely affect our sales and profitability in these markets.\nDefects or failures associated with our products could lead to recalls or safety alerts and negative publicity.\nManufacturing flaws, component failures, design defects, off-label uses, or inadequate disclosure of product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient. These problems could lead to a recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products and result in significant costs and negative publicity. Due to the strong name recognition of our brands, an adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand and could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future. In some circumstances, adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture, or marketing of our products could result in the suspension or delay of regulatory reviews of our applications for new product approvals. We also may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data. Any of the foregoing problems could disrupt our business and have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe depend on international distributors for a substantial portion of our sales. Failure to establish and maintain relationships with distributors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on international distributors for a substantial percentage of our sales. Certain of our distribution agreements may contain terms that are not favorable to us, and as our existing distribution agreements expire, we may be unable to renew with our desired distributors on favorable terms or at all. Furthermore, competition for distributors is intense. We compete for distributors internationally with other leading medical equipment and device companies that may have higher visibility, greater name recognition and financial resources, and a broader product selection than we do. Our competitors also often enter into long-term distribution agreements that effectively prevent their distributors from selling our products. At times, we may also become engaged in contract disputes or other negotiations with distributors. Consequently, establishing relationships with new distributors, maintaining relationships with existing distributors, and replacing distributors may be difficult and time-consuming. Any disruption of our distribution network, including our failure to renew distribution agreements at favorable terms or our failure to successfully negotiate contract disputes, could negatively affect our ability to effectively sell our products and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n- 15 -\nIf we are unable to effectively structure and manage our distribution network, actions taken by our distributors could harm our corporate image and cause us to fail to meet our sales goals.\nWe have limited ability to manage the activities of our independent international distributors. Our distributors could take one or more of the following actions, some of which we have previously experienced and any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, and brand:\n\u00b7\nsell products that compete with products that they have contracted to sell for us;\n\u00b7\nsell our products outside of our pricing guidelines, distorting the market price of our products;\n\u00b7\nsell our products outside their designated territory or to non-authorized end-users, possibly in violation of the exclusive distribution rights of other distributors;\n\u00b7\ndirectly or indirectly distribute products lacking necessary certifications into markets in violation of applicable in-country laws;\n\u00b7\nfail to adequately promote our products; and/or\n\u00b7\nfail to provide proper training, repair, and service to our end-users.\nFailure to adequately manage our distribution network, or non-compliance by distributors with our distribution agreements or applicable law, could harm our corporate image among end-users of our products and disrupt our sales, resulting in a failure to meet our sales goals.\nOur direct sales operations are costly, and the related ongoing operational costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe maintain direct sales operations in the United States and rely on direct sales for nearly all of our sales from the United States. Maintaining a direct sales force is costly. In the United States, we typically provide our direct operations personnel with payroll and other benefits that we do not provide independent distributors or manufacturer representatives. Many of these benefits are fixed costs that do not depend on sales generation. Maintaining these direct operations is costly, and if we are unable to generate sales as planned, such ongoing operational costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to significant government regulation.\nOur business is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate. In the United States, our products are subject to regulation as medical devices by the FDA and by other federal and state agencies. These regulations pertain to the manufacturing, labeling, development, and testing of our devices, as well as to the maintenance of required records. An FDA regulation also requires prompt reporting by all medical device manufacturers of an event or malfunction involving a medical device where the device caused or contributed to death or serious injury or is likely to do so.\nFederal law provides for several routes by which the FDA reviews medical devices before the product enters the marketplace. Medical products of the type currently being marketed and under development by us are subject to regulation under the FD&C Act and numerous acts and amendments such as the Quality System Regulations which replaced the regulations formerly called Good Manufacturing Practices. In addition, depending upon product type, we must also comply with those regulations governing the Conduct of Human Investigations, Pre-Market Regulations, and other requirements, as promulgated by the FDA. The FDA is authorized to inspect a device, its labeling and advertising, and the facilities in which it is manufactured in order to ensure that the device is not manufactured or labeled in a manner which could cause it to be injurious to health.\nThe FDA has adopted regulations which classify medical devices based upon the degree of regulation believed necessary to assure safety and efficacy. A device is classified as a Class I, II, or III device. Class I devices are subject only to general controls. Class II devices, in addition to general controls, are or will be subject to \"performance standards\". Most devices are also subject to the 510(k) pre-market notification provision. In addition, some Class III devices require FDA pre-market approval before they may be marketed commercially because their safety and effectiveness cannot be assured by the general controls and performance standards of Class I or II devices. Our products are primarily Class II devices, and several of them have required FDA notification under Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act.\n- 16 -\nSatisfaction of clearance or approval requirements may take up to several years or more and may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product. The effect of government regulation may be to delay marketing of new products for a considerable or indefinite period of time, to impose costly procedures upon our activities, and to furnish a competitive advantage to larger companies that compete with us. We cannot assure you that FDA or other regulatory clearance or approval for any products we develop will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, or, once granted, that clearances or approvals will not be withdrawn or other regulatory action taken which might limit our ability to market our proposed products. Any delay in obtaining, failure to obtain, or revocation of these clearances or approvals would adversely affect the manufacturing and marketing of our products and the ability to generate additional product sales. The FDA also has the authority to, among other things, deny marketing approval until all regulatory protocols are deemed acceptable, halt the shipment of defective products, and seize defective products sold to customers. Adverse action or publicity from the FDA, if any, could have a negative impact upon our results from operations.\nOur business is impacted by tariffs.\nEffective July 2018, the U.S. government imposed additional duties of 25% on certain imports from China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. All of our FORE-SIGHT ELITE sensor products provided by our contract manufacturer and certain of our monitor product components are subject to the tariffs. While management has considered strategies to mitigate any negative financial impact if the tariffs persist, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in our efforts to reduce or eliminate any additional costs imposed by the new tariffs or whether a financial impact will be of a short-term or long-term nature. Our gross margins were negatively affected by $355,000 of tariff costs, or 1.6% of sales during 2018. Tariff costs for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $253,000, or 4.4% of sales and at current levels of sales may exceed $1.0 million for 2019 if tariffs are levied for a full year. Other non-sensor components also have or may increase as vendors of component parts pass on tariff costs to end-users.\nIn response to the U.S. government tariffs on imports, the government of China imposed tariffs on certain U.S. products entering China, including products shipped to our China distributor. These tariff costs may also impact exports to China of FORE-SIGHT finished goods.\nFederal regulatory reforms may adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products and impact our financial condition.\nEfforts to reform the U.S. healthcare industry have resulted in legislation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Affordable Care Act\") and other measures which will effect changes in healthcare delivery and coverage and public and private reimbursements for services performed. Federal initiatives may also affect state programs. Legislative changes may affect hospital market expenditures for medical devices, the type and volume of procedures performed, and the demand for new and innovative products. These changes could be significant and may adversely affect the demand for our products, our results of operations, cash flows, and our overall financial condition.\nOutside of the U.S., healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems vary by country. Efforts to control rising healthcare costs, changes in government-sponsored programs and participation, and various other economic factors may impact our ability to successfully market our products outside of the U.S.\nOur products may become rapidly obsolete.\nThe markets in which we compete involve rapidly developing technology. Others may develop products that might cause products being developed, distributed, or licensed by us to become obsolete, uneconomical, or result in products superior to our products.\n- 17 -\nOur international business is subject to currency, regulatory, and related risks.\nOur international sales subject us to currency and related risks. We expect that international sales will continue to constitute a significant portion of our business. Although we sell our products in United States dollars and have only limited currency risks, an increase in the value of the United States dollar, relative to foreign currencies in our international markets, could make our products less price competitive in these markets. Our international sales accounted for 16% and 14% of our total net sales from continuing operations for the 2018 and 2017 fiscal years, respectively.\nSubstantial levels of products and components purchased by us are sourced from outside the U.S. Changes in importation laws, regulations, duties or taxes by the U.S. or by other countries could have a material adverse impact on the costs and/or availability of our products.\nOur business practices in countries other than the United States are governed by U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as local laws and regulatory schemes. While we believe we maintain a robust compliance program requiring adherence by our employees and distribution partners to all U.S. and foreign laws and regulatory schemes, there can be no assurances that our foreign distribution partners comply; therefore, failure could cause us to suffer the loss of the ability to sell in those jurisdictions or other liability.\nAn acquisition of the Company may be hindered.\nSubject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement with Edwards, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue from time to time, without stockholder authorization, shares of preferred stock, in one or more designated series or classes. We are also subject to a Delaware statute regulating business combinations. These provisions could discourage, hinder, or preclude an unsolicited acquisition of the Company and could make it less likely that stockholders receive a premium for their shares as a result of any takeover attempt.\nWe have outstanding shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences superior to those of our common stock.\nThe issued and outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series A Exchangeable Preferred Stock grant the holders of such preferred stock voting, accretion, dividend, and liquidation rights that are superior to those held by the holders of our common stock.\nOwnership of our shares is concentrated in the hands of a few investors which could limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence the direction of the company.\nAs calculated by SEC rules of beneficial ownership, Thomas, McNerney & Partners and their affiliates, and Acuta Capital Partners, LLC, each beneficially owned 31.3% and 18.0%, respectively, of our common stock as of the dates of their most recent public filings with the SEC and other available data. Accordingly, although they are not affiliated with one another, they collectively may have the ability to significantly influence or determine the election of all of our directors or the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval. They may exercise this ability in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of our other stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, originally issued through the conversion of preferred stock, exercise of options or warrants, or additional financing transactions, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and would have a dilutive effect upon our stockholders.\nHistorically, our common stock has been thinly traded. This low trading volume may have had a significant effect on the market price of our common stock, which may not be indicative of the market price in a more liquid market. As of December 31, 2018, options and warrants for the purchase of 3,711,032 shares of our common stock were outstanding, and 10,635,019 shares of common stock were issuable upon conversion of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series A Exchangeable Preferred Stock.\nWe depend highly on certain key management personnel.\nWe believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management, in particular, Thomas Patton, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. Paul Benni, our Chief Scientific Officer; Dr. John Gamelin, our Vice President of Research and Development; and Jeffery Baird, our Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of these executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n- 18 -\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since inception, and at this time, we do not anticipate that we will pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we are currently precluded from issuing dividends on our common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement with Edwards and unless we receive the consent of holders of a majority of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series A Exchangeable Preferred Stock.\nFurthermore, our agreement with our secured lender prohibits the payment of cash dividends to both common and preferred stockholders. As of December 31, 2018, $10,407,061 in dividend accretion had accumulated on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the Series A Exchangeable Preferred Stock.", "PERMNO": 86191, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CASM"}
