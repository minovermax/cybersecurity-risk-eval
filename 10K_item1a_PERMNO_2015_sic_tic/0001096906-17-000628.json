{"cik": "720875", "company": "DYNATRONICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-09-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in certain of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following risks and uncertainties, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by us or by any forward-looking statement contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings.\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Our business, operating results, financial condition or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and uncertainties. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. In addition, the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. Our business, operating results, financial performance or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. In assessing the risks and uncertainties described below, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making a decision to invest in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a recent history of losses, and we may not return to or sustain profitability in the future. We have incurred net losses for six consecutive fiscal years. In recent years, we have made substantial investments in research and development, infrastructure, distribution channel expansion and acquisitions to support anticipated future revenue growth. We expect to continue to make significant investments in the development and expansion of our business, which may make it difficult for us to return to profitability. Our present business strategy is to improve cash flow by acquiring businesses that are cash flow positive and by adding to our existing product line and expanding our sales and marketing efforts, including the addition of in-house sales personnel and acquisitions. We cannot predict when we will again achieve profitable operations or that we will not require additional financing to fulfill our business objectives. We may not be able to increase revenue in future periods, and our revenue could decline or grow more slowly than we expect. We may incur significant losses in the future for many reasons, including due to the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may need additional funding and may be unable to raise additional capital when needed, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In the future, we may require additional capital to pursue business opportunities or acquisitions or respond to challenges and unforeseen circumstances. We may also decide to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. We may not be able to secure additional debt or equity financing in a timely manner, on favorable terms, or at all. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Failure to obtain additional financing when needed or on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nOur level of indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations. Our level of indebtedness will impact our future operations in many important ways, including, without limitation, by:\n\u00b7\nRequiring that a portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of any interest or amortization required with respect to outstanding indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nIncreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressure; and\n\u00b7\nLimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes.\nAt the scheduled maturity of our credit facilities or in the event of an acceleration of a debt facility following an event of default, the entire outstanding principal amount of the indebtedness under such facility, together with all other amounts payable thereunder from time to time, will become due and payable. It is possible that we may not have sufficient funds to pay such obligations in full at maturity or upon such acceleration. If we default and are not able to pay any such obligations due, our lenders have liens on substantially all of our assets and could foreclose on our assets in order to satisfy our obligations. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and other financial obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness and other financial transactions, seek additional equity capital or sell our assets. We might then be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell our assets on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our line of credit with a lender matures in March 2019, which will require that we renew the facility at that time. There is no assurance we will be successful in renewing the credit facility from our current or another lender. In addition, any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates, and/or result in significant transaction fees.\nIf we fail to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities and teams, we may not be able to increase our customer base and increase revenues. Increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our products will depend on our ability to expand our sales and marketing teams and their capabilities to obtain new customers and sell additional products and services to existing customers. We believe there is significant competition for direct sales professionals with the skills and technical knowledge that we require, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future. New hires require significant training and time before they become fully productive, and may not become as productive as quickly as we anticipate. Our growth prospects will be harmed if our efforts to expand, train and retain our direct sales team do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue. In addition to our direct sales team, we also extend our sales distribution through relationships with independent sales representatives and marketing service providers. These providers do not have exclusive relationships with us, and we cannot be certain that these partners will prioritize or provide adequate resources for selling our products.\nOur inability to acquire and integrate other businesses, products or technologies could harm our operating results. Our business plan includes the acquisition of other businesses, products and technologies. In fiscal year 2017 we acquired Hausmann and we expect to close our acquisition of B&C on or about October 2, 2017. In the future we expect to acquire or invest in other businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our existing product lines, expand our customer base and operations, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth or cost-saving opportunities. We have limited experience in successfully acquiring and integrating businesses, products and technologies. If we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be successful in negotiating favorable terms of the acquisition, financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. Our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or customer issues.\nAdditionally, in connection with any acquisitions we complete, we may not achieve the synergies or other benefits we expected to achieve, and we may incur write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect our operating results or financial position or could otherwise harm our business. If we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders may be significantly diluted, which could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Further, contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, product or technology could divert management and employee time and resources from other matters.\nChanging market patterns may affect demand for our products. Increasingly, medical markets are moving toward evidence-based practices. Such a move could shrink demand for products we offer if it is deemed there is inadequate evidence to support the efficacy of the products. Likewise, to achieve market acceptance in such environments may require expenditure of funds to do clinical research that may or may not prove adequate efficacy to satisfy all customers.\nUncertain or weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends on domestic and worldwide economic conditions, which may remain challenging for the foreseeable future. Financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or to our industry may adversely affect us. The U.S. economy and other key international economies have been impacted by threatened sovereign defaults and ratings downgrades, falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, threats to major multinational companies, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies, acts of terrorism and overall uncertainty. Healthcare reform in the United States has created a great deal of confusion and reduced capital expenditures for medical equipment and products such as those we manufacture and distribute. These conditions affect the rate of medical device spending and could adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our products, or delay prospective customers' purchasing decisions, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of the economic recovery or any subsequent economic slowdown worldwide, in the United States, or in our industry.\nWe rely on our management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business. Our success and future growth depend upon the continued services of our management team and other key employees, including in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. If new key employees and other members of our senior management team cannot work together effectively, or if other members of our senior management team resign, our ability to effectively manage our business may be impacted. We may terminate any executive officer's employment at any time, with or without cause, and any executive officer may resign at any time, with or without cause. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. The loss of any of our key employees could harm our business.\nHealthcare reform in the United States has had and is expected to continue to have a significant effect on our business and on our ability to expand and grow our business. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, generally known as the Health Care Reform Law, significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers. We expect expansion of access to health insurance may eventually increase the demand for our products and services and pressure to reduce costs of healthcare will likely increase demand for less costly services such as physical therapy in both pre-habilitation and rehabilitation settings, but other provisions of the Health Care Reform Law have affected us adversely. The U.S. Congress has been considering legislation to repeal, modify or replace the Health Care Reform Law. We cannot predict the outcome of these efforts and, as a result, we cannot predict the effect that any such repeal, modification or replacement will have on our business and results of operations. Additionally, further federal and state proposals for health care reform are likely. The reform has created uncertainty regarding reimbursement and delivery of services and has, in past years, resulted in reluctance on the part of health care providers to expand or improve their practices with new products and equipment, which has adversely affected our revenues. We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.\nMedical Device Tax. In December 2015, Congress passed legislation known as the PATH Act. This legislation suspended the medical device tax imposed by The Health Care Reform Law for calendar years 2016 and 2017. Although the excise tax has been suspended by Congress until the end of calendar 2017, its status is unclear for 2018 and subsequent years. Without specific action by Congress to extend the suspension, the medical device tax is scheduled to be reinstated in January 2018.\nAs a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations. The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of some of our products are subject to extensive regulation and increased scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new Class II product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Changes to current Class II products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the Company or our products to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs.\nThe sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy, and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, Office of Inspector General (OIG), Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and the SEC have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also imposes recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on public companies. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions, then we cannot market our products in those jurisdictions. We sell or plan to market some of our products in foreign jurisdictions, as well as in China and the European Union. Many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ. Companies are now required to obtain a CE Mark, which shows conformance with the requirements of applicable European Conformity directives, prior to the sale of some medical devices within the European Union. Some of our current products that require CE Markings have them and it is anticipated that additional and future products may require them as well. We may be required to conduct additional testing or to provide additional information, resulting in additional expenses, to obtain necessary approvals. If we fail to obtain approval in such foreign jurisdictions, we would not be able to sell our products in such jurisdictions, thereby reducing the potential revenue from the sale of our products.\nMarket access could be a limiting factor in our growth. The emergence of Group Purchasing Organizations (GPO's) that control a significant amount of product flow to hospitals and other acute care customers may limit our ability to grow in the acute care space. GPO's issue contracts to manufacturers approximately every three years through a bidding process. Despite repeated efforts, we have been relatively unsuccessful in landing any significant GPO contracts. The process for being placed on contract with a GPO is rigorous and non-transparent. Performance Health, a large competitor, controls the majority of GPO contracts in our market space holding in many instances a sole source contract.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so. While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, these patents, trade secrets, or other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We also rely on nondisclosure and non-competition agreements with certain employees, consultants, and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.\nThe cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payers to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the medical device industry as well as among our customers, including healthcare providers. These conditions could result in greater pricing pressures and limitations on our ability to sell to important market segments, such as group purchasing organizations, integrated delivery networks and large single accounts. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe products we sell are subject to market and technological obsolescence. We offer approximately 10,000 to 15,000 variations of products. If our customers discontinue purchasing a given product, we might have to record expense related to the diminution in value of inventories we have in stock, and depending on the magnitude, that expense could adversely impact our operating results. In addition to the products of others that we distribute, we design and manufacture our own medical devices and products. We may be unable to effectively develop and market products against the products of our competitors in a highly competitive industry. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors. Competitive factors include price, customer service, technology, innovation, quality, reputation and reliability. Our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us or be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners. Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue our level of success in the industry.\nCompetition in research, involving the development and improvement of new and existing products, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product obsolescence. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and new products are introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause some of our products to become obsolete. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, a higher level of inventory write downs may result.\nWe may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. We maintain product liability insurance coverage which we deem to be adequate based on historical experience; however, there can be no assurance that coverage will be available for such risks in the future or that, if available, it would prove sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present amount of insurance can be maintained in force at an acceptable cost. In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable. Furthermore, the assertion of such claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products. The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation. Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.\nOur success is dependent in large part on the accuracy, reliability and proper use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems and management information technology. Our information technology systems are designed and selected in order to facilitate order entry and customer billing, maintain records, accurately track purchases, accounts receivable and accounts payable, manage accounting, finance and manufacturing operations, generate reports and provide customer service and technical support. Any interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations. Financial accounting standards may change or their interpretation may change. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change becomes effective. Changes to existing rules or the re-examining of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. Accounting for revenue from sales of our solutions is particularly complex, is often the subject of intense scrutiny by the SEC, and will evolve as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (''FASB'') continues to consider applicable accounting standards in this area.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise working capital and adversely impact our operations. Our operating results, including components of operating results such as gross margin and cost of product sales, may fluctuate from time to time, and such fluctuations could adversely affect our stock price. Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to fluctuate from time to time in the future. The market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet or exceed expectations of analysts or investors. Any failure to meet these expectations, even if minor, could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock for any reason could result in a reduction in our ability to raise capital.\nOur stock price has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile. For example during the year ended June 30, 2017, the selling price of our common stock ranged from a high of $3.75 to a low of $2.29. The volatility of our stock price can be due to many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the market's expectations about our operating results;\n\u00b7\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our Company or of the healthcare industry in general;\n\u00b7\nstrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u00b7\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nnews reports relating to trends in our markets;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u00b7\nmaterial announcements by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nmaterial announcements by the manufacturers and suppliers we use;\n\u00b7\nsales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant shareholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions and acts of war or terrorism.\nInvestors in our securities may experience substantial dilution with the conversion of preferred stock to common, exercise of stock options and warrants, future issuances of stock, grants of restricted stock and the issuance of stock in connection with our acquisitions of other companies. Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our board of directors (\"Board of Directors\" or \"Board\") has the authority to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock up to the authorized capital stated in the articles of incorporation. Our Board of Directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares of common or preferred stock to acquire one or more businesses or to provide additional financing in the future. As of June 30, 2017, we had outstanding a total of 3,559,000 shares of Series A 8% Convertible Preferred Stock (the \"Series A Preferred\") and Series B 8% Convertible Preferred stock (the \"Series B Preferred\") and associated warrants for the purchase of approximately 5,339,000 shares of common stock. The Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred shares are convertible into common stock. In connection with the acquisition of B&C, announced at the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued or will issue shares of our Series C and Series D Preferred and warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock. The shares of Series C and Series D Preferred will automatically convert to common stock and the warrants will be exercisable for the purchase of common stock following shareholder approval. The conversion of the preferred stock and the exercise of the warrants will result in substantial dilution to common shareholders. From time to time, we have issued and we expect we will continue to issue stock options or restricted stock grants or similar awards to employees, officers, and directors pursuant to our equity incentive award plans. Investors may experience dilution as these awards vest and are exercised by their holders and the restrictions lapse on the restricted stock grants. In addition, we may issue stock or warrants for the purchase of stock for the purpose of raising capital to fund our growth initiatives, in connection with acquisitions of other companies, or in connection with the settlement of obligations and or indebtedness with vendors and suppliers, which may result in investors experiencing dilution. The issuance of any such shares of common or preferred stock may result in a reduction of the book value or market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we do issue any such additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for the purchase of common stock, such issuance also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other shareholders. Further, any such issuance may result in a change of control of our corporation.\nOur current strategy includes growth through acquisitions, which requires us to incur substantial costs and potential liabilities for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits. In addition to internally generated growth, our current strategy involves growth through acquisitions. We may be unable to implement our growth strategy, and our strategy ultimately may be unsuccessful. A significant portion of our growth in revenues has resulted from, and is expected to continue to result from, the acquisition of businesses complementary to our own. We engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and are in various stages of discussion regarding possible acquisitions, certain of which, if consummated, could be significant to us. Any new acquisition could result in material transaction expenses, increased interest and amortization expense, increased depreciation and amortization expenses, increased operating expense, and possible in-process research and development charges for acquisitions that do not meet the definition of a \"business,\" any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Certain businesses that we acquire may not have adequate financial, disclosure, regulatory, quality or other compliance controls at the time we acquire them. As we grow by acquisition, we must manage and integrate the new businesses to bring them into our systems for financial, disclosure, compliance, regulatory and quality control, realize economies of scale, and control costs. In addition, acquisitions involve other risks, including diversion of management resources otherwise available for development of our business and risks associated with entering markets in which our marketing teams and sales force has limited experience or where experienced distribution alliances are not available. Our future profitability will depend in part upon our ability to develop further our resources to adapt to these new products or business areas and to identify and enter into or maintain satisfactory distribution networks. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future, obtain acceptable financing or consummate any future acquisitions. If we cannot integrate acquired operations, manage the cost of providing our products or price our products appropriately, our profitability could suffer. In addition, as a result of our acquisitions of other healthcare businesses, we may be subject to the risk of unanticipated business uncertainties, regulatory and other compliance matters or legal liabilities relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers of the acquired businesses may not indemnify us, for which we may not be able to obtain insurance (or adequate insurance), or for which the indemnification may not be sufficient to cover the ultimate liabilities.\nThe stock markets (including the NASDAQ Market, on which we list our common stock) have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our financial condition, operating performance or prospects. The price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy.\nSubstantial sales of our securities, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. A substantial amount of the shares of our securities are eligible for immediate resale in the public market. Any sales of substantial amounts of our securities in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of the Company. As of June 30, 2017, we had 3,559,000 shares of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred outstanding, convertible into 3,559,000 shares of common stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the shareholders, up to approximately 46,441,000 additional shares of preferred stock, no par value per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company without further action by the shareholders, even where shareholders are offered a premium for their shares. The issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock, including the loss of voting control.", "PERMNO": 31051, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "DYNT"}
