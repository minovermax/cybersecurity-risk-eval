{"cik": "920112", "company": "HEARTLAND FINANCIAL USA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent in our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events described in the risk factors should actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our securities could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect our business activities, financial condition, and results of operations and such effects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nGlobal health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have negatively impacted the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty and abruptly reduced economic activity. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nThe pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, including the declaration of a federal National Emergency; multiple cities\u2019 and states\u2019 declarations of states of emergency; school and business closings; limitations on social or public gatherings and other social distancing measures, such as working remotely; travel restrictions, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. Such measures have significantly contributed to rising unemployment and negatively impacted consumer and business spending, borrowing needs and saving habits. The federal government has taken measures to address the economic and social consequences of the pandemic, including the passage of the CARES Act and later with the adoption of the PPFA and the Economic Aid Act. The CARES Act, as supplemented by the PPFA and Economic Aid Act, among other things, provides certain measures to support individuals and businesses in maintaining solvency through monetary relief, including in the form of financing, loan forgiveness and automatic forbearance. There can be no assurance, however, that the steps taken by the worldwide community or the U.S. government will be sufficient to address the negative economic effects of COVID-19 or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity.\nWe may experience adverse financial consequences due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022negative effects on net interest income and net interest margins as a result of the low interest rate environment;\n\u2022increased credit losses due to financial strain on our customers as a result of the pandemic and governmental actions, specifically on loans to borrowers in the lodging, retail trade, retail properties, restaurants and bars and oil and gas;\n\u2022increases in our provision for credit losses and net charge-offs resulting from increased credit losses;\n\u2022declines in collateral values;\n\u2022an impairment of goodwill or core deposit and customer relationship intangibles that could result in charges being recorded and restrictions on the ability of certain Banks to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022loan modifications and loan payment deferrals resulting in reduced earnings;\n\u2022increased demand on our liquidity as we meet borrowers\u2019 needs and cover expenses related to the pandemic management plan;\n\u2022negative effects on capital and leverage ratios as a result of reduced liquidity which, although not currently contemplated, could reduce or force suspension of dividends;\n\u2022stock price volatility;\n\u2022workforce disruptions if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic;\n\u2022third-party disruptions, including negative effects on network providers and other suppliers, which may affect their ability to perform under the terms of agreements or provide essential services;\n\u2022increased cyber and payment fraud risk due to increased online and remote activity; and\n\u2022other operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices because of the pandemic and governmental actions to contain it.\nThese factors may remain prevalent for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nOur participation in the Paycheck Protection Program and other regulatory and governmental actions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 could result in reputational harm, claims and litigation.\nOur Banks are participating lenders in the PPP, a loan program administered through the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") that was created under the CARES Act, and modified by the PPFA and Economic Aid Acts, to help eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons fund their operational costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this program, the SBA guarantees 100% of the amounts of fixed, low interest rate loans that are subject to numerous other regulatory requirements. Borrowers are also eligible to apply to the SBA for forgiveness of their PPP loan obligations, and most are expected to do so. Because of the short windows between the passing of the authorizing legislation and the opening of the PPP, there was and continues to be some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. Subsequent rounds of legislation and associated agency guidance have not provided necessary clarity and have created potential additional inconsistencies and ambiguities. Accordingly, the Banks are exposed to risks relating to compliance with the PPP requirements, including reputational harm. Additionally, since the launch of the PPP, several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If PPP borrowers fail to qualify for loan forgiveness, the Banks face a heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates for an extended period of time. The Banks have credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a\ndeficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced. If a deficiency is identified, the SBA may deny forgiveness, take action against borrowers and, in some instances, deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Banks.\nEconomic and Market Conditions Risk\nOur business and financial results are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions.\nOur business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and particularly in the states in which our Banks operate. Factors such as the volatility of interest rates, home prices and real estate values, unemployment, credit defaults, increased bankruptcies, decreased consumer spending and household income, volatility in the securities markets, and the cost and availability of capital have negatively impacted our business in the past and may adversely impact us in the future. Economic deterioration that affects household and/or corporate incomes could result in renewed credit deterioration and reduced demand for credit or fee-based products and services, negatively impacting our performance. In addition, changes in securities market conditions and monetary fluctuations could adversely affect the availability and terms of funding necessary to meet our liquidity needs.\nOur business is concentrated in and dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of the various markets that we serve.\nWe operate in markets in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas, Missouri, Texas and California, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes in the economic conditions in those markets. Our success depends upon the economic vitality, business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in those areas and may be impacted by the effects of past and future civil unrest and domestic disturbances in the communities that we serve. Although our customers' business and financial interests may extend well beyond our market areas, adverse economic conditions that affect our specific market area could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us and impact the stability of our deposit funding sources. Consequently, declines in economic conditions in those markets could generally affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and performance are vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.\nAs most of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature, our performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in the financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to us. Financial market volatility may:\n\u2022Affect the value or liquidity of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments.\n\u2022Affect the value of capitalized servicing assets.\n\u2022Affect our ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\u2022Affect the value of the assets that we manage or otherwise administer or service for others. Although we are not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for our services.\nChanges in interest rates and other conditions could negatively impact net interest income and net interest margin.\nMarket interest rates have declined significantly since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate and announced a $700 billion quantitative easing program in response the expected economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Federal Reserve reduced the interest rate it pays on excess reserves. We expect that these reductions in interest rates, especially if prolonged, could continue to adversely affect our net interest income and margins and our profitability.\nAs a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are interest-bearing, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on our financial performance. Our profitability is in part a function of the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Like most banking institutions, our net interest spread and margin will be affected by general economic conditions and other factors, including fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve that influence market interest rates, and our ability to respond to changes in such rates. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, and it influences interest rates by changing the discount rate at which it lends money to banks and by adjusting the target for the federal funds rate at which banks borrow from other banks. Its fiscal and monetary policies determine, in a large part, our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. Federal Reserve Board policies can also materially affect the value of financial instruments that we hold, such as debt securities and mortgage servicing rights.\nAt any given time, our assets and liabilities may be affected differently by a given change in interest rates. Asset values, especially commercial real estate collateral, securities or other fixed rate earning assets, can decline significantly with relatively minor changes in interest rates. As a result, an increase or decrease in rates, the length of loan terms or the mix of adjustable and fixed rate loans in our portfolio could have a positive or negative effect on our net income, capital and liquidity. We measure interest rate risk under various rate scenarios using specific criteria and assumptions. A summary of this process, along with the results of our net interest income simulations, is presented under the caption \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" included under Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable and effectively managed, significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and specifically, our net interest income. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the planned phasing out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a reference rate.\nWe have derivative contracts, borrowings, variable rate loans and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on the LIBOR. In 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmarks Administration (\"IBA\"), which compiles and oversees LIBOR, announced a consultation on its intention to cease publication of one-week and two-month LIBOR at the end of 2021 and to continue publishing other LIBOR tenors until June 2023. It is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR or whether LIBOR will continue to be published by the IBA after these dates based on these submissions or on any other basis.\nThe transition from LIBOR to SOFR or a different alternative reference rate is complex and could have a range of adverse impacts on us. In particular, any such transition could, among other things, (i) adversely effect the value of, return on and trading for financial assets or liabilities that are linked to LIBOR, including securities, loans or derivatives; (ii) require renegotiation of outstanding financial assets and liabilities; (iii) result in additional inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect to our preparation and readiness for the LIBOR transition; (iv) increase the risks of disputes or litigation and/or increase expenses related to the transition; (v) adversely impact our reputation as we work with customers to transition loans and financial instruments from LIBOR; (vi) require successful system and analytics development and operationalization to transition to our systems, loan portfolio and risk management processes away from LIBOR, which will require reliance on third-party vendors; and (vii) cause disruption in financial markets that are relevant to our business.\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2020-04 \"Reference Rate Reform\" which addresses the effect of the anticipated transfer away from LIBOR towards new interest rate benchmarks under GAAP. We have formed a working group that continues to actively assess the impacts of ASU 2020-04 and the related opportunities and risks involved in the LIBOR transition. However, there can be no assurance that actions taken by us and third parties to address these risks or otherwise prepare for the transition from LIBOR will be successful.\nWe have recorded goodwill as a result of acquisitions, and if it becomes impaired, our earnings could be significantly impacted.\nUnder current accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Although we do not anticipate impairment charges, if we conclude that some portion of our goodwill may be impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded against earnings. A goodwill impairment charge could be caused by a decline in our stock price or occurrence of a triggering event that compounds the negative results in an unfavorable quarter. At December 31, 2020, we had goodwill of $576.0 million, representing approximately 28% of stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe have substantial deferred tax assets that could require a valuation allowance and a charge against earnings if we conclude that the tax benefits represented by the assets are unlikely to be realized.\nOur consolidated balance sheet reflected approximately $62.7 million of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020, that represents differences in the timing of the benefit of deductions, credits and other items for accounting purposes and the benefit for tax purposes. To the extent we conclude that the value of this asset is not more likely than not to be realized, we would be obligated to record a valuation allowance against the asset, impacting our earnings during the period in which the valuation allowance is recorded. Assessing the need for, or the sufficiency of, a valuation allowance requires management to evaluate all available evidence, both negative and positive. Positive evidence necessary to overcome the negative evidence includes whether future taxable income in sufficient amounts and character within the carryback and carryforward periods is available under the\ntax law. When negative evidence (e.g., cumulative losses in recent years, history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused) exists, more positive evidence than negative evidence will be necessary. If the positive evidence is not sufficient to exceed the negative evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established. The creation of a substantial valuation allowance could have a significant negative impact on our reported results in the period in which it is recorded. The impact of the impairment of Heartland's deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the federal, state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe are subject to changes in tax law that could increase our effective tax rates. The enactment of such legislation including provisions impacting tax rates, apportionment, consolidation or combination, income, expenses, credits and exemptions may have a material impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. These tax law changes may also be retroactive to previous periods and could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. For example, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017 reduced our federal corporate tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21%, there is no assurance that tax rates will remain at current levels or that presently anticipated benefits will be realized in future years\u2019 financial performance.\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by natural disasters, climate change, pandemics, terrorist activities, domestic disturbances or international hostilities\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential impact of natural disasters, climate change, pandemics, terrorist activities, domestic disturbances or international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us directly (for example, by interrupting the ours systems, which could prevent the us from obtaining deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling the flow of business; causing significant damage to our facilities; or otherwise preventing us from conducting business in the ordinary course), or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers, vendors or other counterparties (for example, by damaging properties pledged as collateral for our loans or impairing the ability of certain borrowers to repay their loans). We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that natural disasters, climate change, pandemics, terrorist activities, domestic disturbances or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region. These types of impacts could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge- offs and provisions for credit\nlosses.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of these occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of natural disasters, climate change, pandemics, terrorist activities, domestic disturbances or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we transact with, particularly those that we depend upon, but have no control over. Additionally, the force and frequency of natural disasters are increasing as the climate changes.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and losses.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, reputation risk, and operational risk related to our employees, systems and vendors, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that it has not appropriately anticipated or identified. We must also develop and maintain a culture of risk management among our employees, as well as manage risks associated with third parties, and could fail to do so effectively. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could incur litigation and negative regulatory consequences, and suffer unexpected losses that could affect its financial condition or\nresults of operations.\nCredit Risks\nIf we do not properly manage our credit risk, we could suffer material credit losses.\nThere are substantial risks inherent in making any loan, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers;\n\u2022uncertainties as to the future value of collateral; and\n\u2022the risk of non-payment of loans.\nAlthough we attempt to minimize our credit risk through prudent loan underwriting procedures and by monitoring concentrations of our loans, there can be no assurance that these underwriting and monitoring procedures will effectively reduce these risks. Moreover, as we continue to expand into new markets, credit administration and loan underwriting policies and procedures may need to be adapted to local conditions. The inability to properly manage our credit risk or appropriately adapt our credit administration and loan underwriting policies and procedures to local market conditions or to changing economic circumstances could have an adverse impact on our allowance and provision for credit losses and our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are subject to lending concentration risks.\nOur commercial loans, which tend to be larger and more complex credits than loans to individuals, are primarily approved based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. If the economy weakens or if the industry in which the borrower operates weakens, our borrowers may experience depressed or sudden decreases in revenues that could hinder their cash flow and ability to repay their loans. Consequently, declines in the economy could have a material adverse impact on our earnings. Most often, the underlying collateral consists of accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The other types of collateral securing these loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the customer's business and market conditions.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about our customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, regarding the accuracy and completeness of that information. As a result of the current economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are engaging in more frequent communication with borrowers to better understand their creditworthiness and the challenges faced. These communications should allow Heartland to respond proactively as borrower needs and issues arise. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could cause us to make uncollectible loans or enter into other unfavorable transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur loan portfolio has a large concentration of commercial real estate loans, a segment that can be subject to volatile cash flows and collateral values.\nCommercial real estate lending, which is comprised of owner-occupied, non-owner occupied, and real estate construction loans, represents a large portion of our commercial loan portfolio. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in any of our geographic markets in which the real estate is located. Adverse developments in nationwide or regional market conditions affecting real estate values could negatively impact of our commercial real estate loans, and other developments could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans typically are dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. We believe that the effect of and response to the COVID-19 pandemic (as separately described above) will have some impact on all commercial real estate loans and more heavily impact lodging, retail trade, and retail properties, in particular those retail properties dependent on restaurants and bars, and the oil and gas, segments.\nReal estate construction loans involve additional risks because funds are advanced based upon estimates of costs and the estimated value of the completed project and also have a greater risk of default in a weaker economy because the source of repayment is reliant on the successful and timely sale of lots or land held for resale. These loans present project completion risks, as well as the risks applicable to other commercial real estate loans. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control of Heartland or the borrower could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties.\nWe may encounter issues with environmental law compliance if we take possession, through foreclosure or otherwise, of the real property that secures a commercial real estate loan.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If previously unknown or undisclosed hazardous or toxic substances are discovered, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses which may materially reduce the affected property's value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental\nreview at the time of underwriting a loan secured by real property and also before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ability of a borrower to repay agricultural loans may be especially affected by many factors outside of the borrower\u2019s control.\nPayments on agricultural and agricultural real estate loans are dependent on the profitable operation or management of the farm property securing the loan. If the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as farm equipment or assets such as livestock or crops may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage to or depreciation in the value of livestock.\nThe success of a farm may be affected by many factors outside the control of the borrower, including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields (such as hail, drought and floods), loss of livestock due to disease or other factors, declines in market prices for agricultural products (both domestically and internationally) and the impact of government regulations (including changes to global trade agreements, price supports, subsidies and environmental regulations). In addition, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm.\nWe hold one- to four-family first-lien residential mortgage loans in our loan portfolio, and the ability of the borrower to repay may be difficult to estimate.\nThe residential mortgage loans that we hold in our loan portfolio are primarily to borrowers we believe to be credit worthy based on internal standards and guidelines. Repayment is dependent upon the borrower's ability to repay the loan and the underlying value of the collateral. If we have overestimated or improperly calculated the abilities of the borrowers to repay those loans, default rates could be high, and we could face more legal process and costs to enforce collection of the loan obligations. If the value of the collateral is incorrect, we could face higher losses on the loans.\nEconomic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may make it difficult for some customers to repay their loans, resulting in increased credit losses.\nThe effect of and response to the COVID-19 pandemic (as separately described above) will make it difficult for some customers to make timely payments on their loans in accordance with their terms. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will have some impact on all customers and more heavily impact the lodging, retail trade, retail properties, restaurants and bars and oil and gas segments. As of December 31, 2020, Heartland's aggregate loan exposure to borrowers in these segments was $1.82 billion or 14% of total loan exposure.\nIn keeping with guidance from regulators, we have actively worked with COVID-19 affected borrowers to defer their payments, interest, and fees. Beginning in March of 2020, we offered certain customers the opportunity to modify the terms of existing loans, resulting in interest only payments or the deferment of principal and interest payments for a set period of time, typically 90 days. In accordance with regulatory guidance, these modifications are not considered or reported as troubled debt restructurings. While interest and fees will still accrue to income, through normal GAAP accounting, should eventual credit losses on these deferred payments occur, interest income and fees accrued would need to be reversed. In such a scenario, interest income and net interest margin could be negatively impacted in future periods. Upon completion of these initial deferral periods, it is anticipated that some loans will return to normal repayment and other may require further modifications. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $122.8 million of the modifications made by us remained in some form of payment deferral as a result of these modifications.\nThese loan deferrals are intended to increase the likelihood that the affected borrowers will operate through and recover following the COVID-19 pandemic, after which their loans will return to a normal repayment schedule and perform in accordance with their original terms. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be successful and may instead only result in a delay rather than avoidance of deterioration or losses on loans to the affected borrowers. If economic conditions worsen, we could be required to further increase our allowance for credit losses and record additional credit loss expense. Our asset quality measures could worsen during future measurement periods if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are prolonged.\nGovernment programs established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may delay but not avoid the realization of credit losses.\nPursuant to the CARES Act, beginning at the end of March 2020, the SBA made up to six months of principal and interest payments on behalf of borrowers on certain qualifying SBA guaranteed loans. Pursuant to the Economic Aid Act, beginning in February of 2021 the SBA began making an additional three months of such principal and interest payments.\nThe CARES Act also established the PPP (as further described above). PPP loans are also in payment deferral, requiring no principal or interest payments until the loan forgiveness process is completed. Pursuant to the Economic Aid Act, in January of 2021, the PPP loan program was re-opened for new PPP borrowers and expanded to allow certain previous PPP borrowers to receive a second draw PPP loan. Second draw PPP loans are also 100% SBA guaranteed, eligible for up to 100% forgiveness by the SBA and will be in payment deferral, requiring no principal or interest payments until the loan forgiveness process is completed.\nThe foregoing programs are intended to increase the likelihood that the affected borrowers operate through and recover following the COVID-19 pandemic, after which their loans will return to a normal repayment schedule and perform in accordance with their original terms or in the case of PPP loans, will be forgiven. There can be no assurance, however, that these programs will be successful and may instead result in a delay rather than avoidance of deterioration or losses on loans to the affected borrowers. In addition, while the implementation and success of these programs is highly dependent on the SBA and other governmental bodies, these programs also expose the participating financial institutions, including Heartland, to reputational risks.\nOur allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe establish our allowance for credit losses in consultation with management of the Banks and maintain it at a level considered appropriate by management to absorb current expected credit losses and risks inherent in the portfolio. While the level of allowance for credit losses reflects management's continuing evaluation of quantitative and qualitative factors including industry concentrations, loan portfolio quality and economic conditions, the amount of future loan losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond our control, and such losses may exceed current estimates. Despite the current stable economic and market conditions, there remains a risk of continued asset and economic deterioration. At December 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.31% and as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was approximately 149%. Although we believe that the allowance for credit losses is appropriate to absorb current expected credit losses on any existing loans that may become uncollectible, we cannot predict loan losses with certainty, and we cannot provide assurance that our allowance for credit losses will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future. Further significant provisions, or charge-offs against our allowance that result in provisions, could have a significant negative impact on our profitability. Credit losses in excess of our reserves may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\" which replaced the \"incurred loss\" model for recognizing credit losses with an \"expected loss\" model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model. The new CECL standard became effective for us on January 1, 2020. Under the CECL model, we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. CECL also requires that an allowance for credit losses be established for any unfunded loan commitments that are not cancelable. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount, including anticipated losses resulting from deteriorating economic conditions as a result of events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This measurement takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the incurred loss model previously required under GAAP, which delayed recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, the adoption of the CECL model materially affected how we determine our allowance for credit losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance in future periods. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for credit losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for credit losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impact of the adoption of this standard.\nWhile the fiscal stimulus and relief programs enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have mitigated credit losses in the near term, once these programs have run their course, we may experience changes in the value of collateral securing outstanding loans, deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers, and the inability of borrowers to repay loans in accordance with their loan terms causing credit losses.\nLiquidity and Interest Rate Risks\nLiquidity is essential to our business, and our performance could be adversely affected by constraints in or increased costs for funding.\nWe require liquidity to fund our deposit and debt obligations as they come due. A number of factors beyond our control could have a detrimental impact on the availability or costs of that funding. These include market disruptions, changes in our credit ratings or the sentiment of investors, the state of the regulatory environment and monetary and fiscal policies, declines in the value of our investment securities, loss of substantial deposits or customer relationships, financial or systemic shocks, significant counterparty failures or reputational damage. Our ability to meet current financial obligations is a function of our balance sheet structure, ability to liquidate assets and access to alternative sources of funds. Our access to deposits can be impacted by the liquidity needs of our customers as a substantial portion of our deposit liabilities are on demand, while a significant portion of our assets are loans that cannot be sold in the same timeframe or are securities that may not be readily saleable if there is disruption in capital markets. If we become unable to obtain funds when needed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe required accounting treatment of loans we acquire through acquisitions could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest margins and interest income in future periods.\nUnder United States GAAP, we are required to record loans acquired through acquisitions, at fair value. Estimating the fair value of such loans requires management to make estimates based on available information and facts and circumstances on the acquisition date. Any net discount, which is the excess of the amount of reasonably estimable and probable discounted future cash collections over the purchase price, is accreted into interest income over the weighted average remaining contractual life of the loans. Therefore, our net interest margins may fluctuate due to the net discount accretion. We expect the yields on the total loan portfolio will decline as our acquired loan portfolios pay down or mature and the corresponding accretion of the net discount decreases. We expect downward pressure on our interest income to the extent that the runoff of our acquired loan portfolios is not replaced with comparable high-yielding loans. This could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest margins and interest income in future periods.\nOur liability portfolio, including deposits, may subject us to liquidity risk and pricing risk from concentrations.\nWe strive to maintain a diverse liability portfolio, and we manage deposit portfolio diversification through our asset/liability committee process. However, even with our efforts to maintain diversification, we occasionally accept larger deposit customers, and our typical deposit customers might occasionally carry larger balances. Unanticipated, significant changes in these large balances could affect our liquidity risk and pricing risk, particularly within the deposit portfolio of a single Bank, where the effects of the concentration would be greater than for Heartland as a whole. Our inability to manage deposit concentration risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth may create the need to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We anticipate that our existing capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. However, from time to time, we raise additional capital to support continued growth, both internally and through acquisitions. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired.\nWe rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue and are subject to restrictions on payment of dividends.\nThe primary source of funds for Heartland is dividends from the Banks. In general, the Banks may only pay dividends either out of their historical net income after any required transfers to surplus or reserves have been made or out of their retained earnings. The payment of dividends by any financial institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and a financial institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on Heartland's common and preferred stock and to pay interest and principal on our debt. Dividends payable on common shares are also subject to quarterly dividends payable on outstanding preferred shares at the applicable dividend rate.\nReduction in the value, or impairment of our investment securities, can impact our earnings and common stockholders' equity.\nWe maintained a balance of $6.29 billion, or 35% of our assets, in investment securities at December 31, 2020. Changes in market interest rates can affect the value of these investment securities, with increasing interest rates generally resulting in a reduction of value. Although the reduction in value from temporary increases in market rates does not affect our income until the security is sold, it does result in an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income that can reduce our common stockholders\u2019 equity. Further, we may have to record provision expense to establish an allowance for credit losses on our carried at fair value debt securities, and we must periodically test our investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment in value. In assessing whether the impairment of investment securities is other-than-temporary, we consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term.\nOperational Risks\nWe have a continuing need for technological change and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to being able to better serve customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our market areas. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need to implement technological changes as a result of modifications to our business practices implemented in order to address governmental restriction and requirements to address the needs, preferences and best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.\nOur operations are affected by risks associated with our use of vendors and other third-party service providers.\nWe rely on vendor and third-party relationships for a variety of products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day activities, particularly in the areas of correspondent relationships, operations, treasury management, information technology and security. This reliance exposes us to risks of those third parties failing to perform financially or failing to perform contractually or to our expectations. These risks could include material adverse impacts on our business, such as credit loss or fraud loss, disruption or interruption of business activities, cyber-attacks and information security breaches, poor performance of services affecting our customer relationships and/or reputation, and possibilities that we could be responsible to our customers for legal or regulatory violations committed by those third parties while performing services on our behalf. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of third-party disruptions, including negative effects on network providers and other suppliers, which have been, and may further be, affected by, stay-at-home orders, market volatility and other factors that increase their risks of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide essential services. While we have implemented an active program of oversight to address this risk, there can be no assurance that our vendor and third-party relationships will not have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers, clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including for example financial counterparties, regulators, and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access or electrical power. Due to the increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes or comprises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interconnectivity and complexity may increase the risk of operational failure on both an individual and industry-wide basis.\nInterruption in or breaches of our network security and the resulting theft or compromise of business and customer information could adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business, and as part of our business, we maintain significant amounts of data about our customers and the products they use. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers and fraudsters. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of\nconfidential, personal, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties.\nWe, our customers, regulators and other third parties, including other financial service institutions and companies engaging in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal emails of employees, or breaches of third party vendors that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering and monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and any other information of ours, our employees, our customers, or of third parties, and damage to our systems or other material disruptions. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to protect our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, and other measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of and rapid evolution of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunication technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based products offerings and increase our internal usage of web-based products and applications. Given the continued and rapid evolution of cyber threats, we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased cyber and payment fraud risk due to increased online and remote activity. The occurrence of any failure, interruption, or security breach of our information systems could result in violations of privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations\nWe could face significant legal and reputational harm if we fail to safeguard personal information.\nHeartland is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected individuals can include our customers, our employees, and the employees of our suppliers, counterparties and other third parties. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information comply with applicable laws and regulations in relevant jurisdictions can increase operating costs, impact the development of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency. Any mishandling or misuse of the personal information of customers, employees or others by Heartland or a third party affiliated with Heartland could expose us to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nAdditional risks could arise if Heartland or third parties do not provide adequate disclosure or transparency to our customers about the personal information collected from them and its use; any failure to receive, document, and honor the privacy preferences expressed by our customers; any failure to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure; or any failure to maintain proper training on privacy practices for all employees or third parties who have access to personal data. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information and abide by privacy preferences, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and thereby reduce our revenues. In addition, any failure or perceived failure by Heartland to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions. Any of these outcomes could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe potential for business interruption exists throughout our organization.\nIntegral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our technical systems, operational infrastructure, relationships with third parties and the ability of our employees to perform their jobs day-to-day to support our on-going operations. Failure by any or all of these resources subjects us to risks that may vary in size, scale and scope. These risks include, but are not limited to, operational or technical failures, ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support, as well as the loss of key individuals, including those with specialized skills, or in general, the failure of key individuals to perform properly. These risks are heightened during necessary data system changes or conversions and system integrations of newly acquired entities. Although management has established policies and procedures to address such failures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks from employee errors, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee or customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or\nunauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur markets and growth strategy rely heavily on our management team, and the unexpected loss of key managers may adversely affect our operations.\nMuch of our success to date has been influenced strongly by our ability to attract and to retain senior management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in our different market areas. Because our service areas are spread over such a wide geographical area, our management headquartered in Dubuque, Iowa, is dependent on the effective leadership and capabilities of the management in our local markets for the continued success of Heartland. Our ability to retain executive officers, the current management teams and loan officers of our operating subsidiaries will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategy and could be difficult during times of low unemployment. It is also critical, as we grow, to be able to attract and retain qualified additional management and loan officers with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market area to implement our community-based operating strategy. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew lines of business, products and services are essential to our ability to compete but may subject us to additional risks.\nWe continually implement new lines of business and offer new products and services within existing lines of business to offer our customers a competitive array of products and services. There can be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets for such products and services are still developing. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products or services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur analytical and forecasting models may be improper or ineffective.\nThe processes we use to estimate our current expected credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models could reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws and limitations in their design or their implementation. If the models we use to guide management's decisions and oversight relating to interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models we use for determining our probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be appropriate to support future charge-offs. If the models we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur internal controls may be ineffective.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the controls are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nStrategic and External Risks\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect our liquidity and operations.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by Heartland or the Banks or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may experience difficulties in managing our growth and our growth strategy involves risks that may negatively impact our net income.\nAs part of our general growth strategy, we have acquired, and may acquire, additional banks that we believe provide a strategic and geographic fit with our business. We cannot predict the number, size or timing of acquisitions. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately and profitably manage this growth. Acquiring other banks and businesses will involve risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including:\n\u2022potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks and businesses we acquire;\n\u2022exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired bank or related business;\n\u2022difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of banks and businesses we acquire;\n\u2022potential disruption to our business;\n\u2022potential restrictions on our business resulting from the regulatory approval process;\n\u2022inability to realize the expected revenue increases, costs savings, market presence and/or other anticipated benefits;\n\u2022potential diversion of our management's time and attention; and\n\u2022the possible loss of key employees and customers of the banks and businesses we acquire.\nIn addition to acquisitions, we may expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets by undertaking additional de novo bank formations or branch openings. Based on our experience, we believe that it generally takes three years or more for new banking facilities to first achieve operational profitability, due to the impact of organization and overhead expenses and the start-up phase of generating loans and deposits. To the extent that we undertake additional branching and de novo bank and business formations, we are likely to continue to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations, which may have an adverse effect on our levels of reported net income, return on average equity and return on average assets.\nWe face intense competition in all phases of our business and competitive factors could adversely affect our business.\nThe banking and financial services business in our markets is highly competitive and is currently undergoing significant change. Our competitors include large regional banks, local community banks, online banks, thrifts, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market mutual funds, credit unions and other non-bank financial service providers, and increasingly these competitors provide integrated financial services over a broad geographic area. Some of our competitors may also have access to governmental programs that impact their position in the marketplace favorably. Increased competition in our markets may result in changes in our business model, sales of certain assets or business units, decreases in the amounts of our loans and deposits, reduced spreads between loan rates and deposit rates or loan terms that are more favorable to the borrower. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and remain profitable.\nLegal, Compliance and Reputational Risks\nGovernment regulation can result in limitations on our growth strategy.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to supervision and regulation by a number of governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the CFPB, Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and the various state agencies where we have a bank presence. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to provide protection for depositors and customers rather than for the benefit of stockholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters relating to ownership and control of our shares, our acquisition of other companies and businesses, our ability to offer new products, our ability to obtain financing and other aspects of our strategy.\nWe are subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision, which can increase the cost of doing business and lead to enforcement actions.\nFederal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than shareholders. These laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of our business, the kinds and amounts of investments that we and the Banks may make, reserve requirements, required capital levels relative to assets, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, our ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with our and the Banks' insiders and affiliates and our payment of dividends.\nIt is uncertain whether and to what extent the current administration will increase the regulatory burden on community banks, and changes in existing regulations and their enforcement may require modification to Heartland's existing regulatory compliance and risk management infrastructure.\nWe have experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny following the global financial crisis and as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and the reforms have caused our compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB with broad authority to administer and enforce a new federal regulatory framework of consumer financial regulation, changing the base for deposit insurance assessments, introducing regulatory rate-setting for interchange fees charged to merchants for debit card transactions, enhancing the regulation of consumer mortgage banking, changing the methods and standards for resolution of troubled institutions, and changing the Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio calculations for bank holding companies.\nIn the routine course of regulatory oversight, proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations of banks and other financial institutions are frequently raised in the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and before bank regulatory authorities. Similarly, proposals to change the accounting and financial reporting requirements applicable to banks and other depository financial institutions are frequently raised by the SEC, the federal banking agencies and other authorities. The likelihood of significant changes in laws and regulations in the future and the effect such changes might have on our operations are impossible to determine. Recent changes in the laws and regulations that apply to us have been significant. Moreover, dramatic changes in statutes, regulations or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of financial services and products that we offer and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products.\nMore stringent requirements related to capital and liquidity may limit our ability to return earnings to stockholders or operate or invest in our business.\nThe Federal Reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines that are used to assess the adequacy of capital in supervising a bank holding company. The final Basel III rules and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Heartland. Under Basel III, the fully-phased in capital conservation buffer is 2.50% above the minimum capital requirement.\nAdditional requirements may be imposed in the future. The Basel Committee continues to examine ways to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks and has produced, and continues to produce a number of consultation and discussion papers which point to a significant revision of the Basel Framework, including improvements to the calculation of risk-weighted assets and the comparability of capital ratios. The ultimate impact on our capital and liquidity will depend on the implementation of further changes in the United States.\nWe are becoming subject to additional regulatory requirements as our total assets increase, and these additional requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nVarious federal banking laws and regulations impose heightened requirements on larger banks and bank holding companies. These heightened requirements have added, and will continue to add, restrictions and complexity to our business operations, as we expand. For example, we were required to comply with the Durbin Amendment effective July 1, 2019, which imposes interchange fee restrictions to debit card issuers.\nThe Economic Growth Act exempted bank holding companies under $100 billion in assets from certain Dodd-Frank Act requirements that were otherwise applicable to bank holding companies with greater than $10 billion and $50 billion in total consolidated assets. As required by the Economic Growth Act, the federal banking agencies adopted rules further tailoring their supervision and regulation of large bank holding companies with more than $100 billion in assets. However, federal banking agencies have also indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of\ninstitutions with total assets less than $100 billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process, which may offset the impact of the relief from stress testing and risk management requirements provided by the Economic Growth Act.\nLitigation and enforcement actions could result in negative publicity and could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nWe face significant legal and regulatory risks in our business, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and governmental proceedings against financial institutions have increased in recent years. Reputation risk, or the risk to our earnings and capital from the resulting negative publicity, is inherent to our business. Current public uneasiness with the United States banking system heightens this risk, as banking customers often transfer news regarding consumer fraud, financial difficulties or even failure of some institutions, to fear of fraud, financial difficulty or failure of even the most secure institutions. In this climate, any negative news may become cause for curtailment of business relationships, withdrawal of funds or other actions that can have a compounding effect, and could adversely affect our operations.\nSubstantial legal liability or significant governmental action against us could materially impact our business and financial results. Also, the resolution of a litigation or regulatory matter could result in additional accruals or exceed established accruals for a particular period, which could materially impact our results from operations for that period.\nRisks of Owning Stock in Heartland\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nOur stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, including: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results; recommendations by securities analysts; acquisitions or business combinations; capital commitments by or involving Heartland or our Banks; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us; new technology used or services offered by our competitors; new reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry; and changes in government regulations. General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events have caused a decline in our stock price in the past, and these factors, as well as, interest rate changes, continued unfavorable credit loss trends, or unforeseen events such as terrorist attacks could cause our stock price to be volatile regardless of our operating results.\nStockholders may experience dilution as a result of future equity offerings and acquisitions.\nIn order to raise capital for future acquisitions or for general corporate purposes, we may offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at a price per share that may be lower than the current price. In addition, investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, may be higher or lower than the price paid by existing stockholders.\nCertain banking laws and the Heartland Stockholder Rights Plan may have an anti-takeover effect.\nCertain federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Heartland, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to Heartland\u2019s stockholders. In addition, Heartland's Amended and Restated Rights Agreement (the \"Rights Plan\") causes it to be difficult for any person to acquire 15% or more of Heartland's outstanding stock (with certain limited exceptions) without the permission of our board of directors. The combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of Heartland's common stock.", "PERMNO": 89736, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HTLF"}
