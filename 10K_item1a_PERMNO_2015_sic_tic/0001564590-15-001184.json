To facilitate your consideration of all of the risks described below, these risks are organized under headings and subheadings for your convenience. If any of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and stock price.\nRisks Relating to Reimbursement and Regulation of Our Business\nHealthcare reform has initiated significant changes to the United States healthcare system.\nVarious healthcare reform provisions became law upon enactment of the ACA. The reforms contained in the ACA have impacted each of our businesses in some manner. Several of the reforms are very significant and could ultimately change the nature of our services, the methods of payment for our services and the underlying regulatory environment. The reforms include the possible modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment, bundling payments to cover both acute and post-acute care and the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers. The ACA also provides for: (1) reductions to the annual market basket payment updates for LTAC hospitals, IRFs, home health agencies and hospice providers, which could result in lower reimbursement than in the preceding year; (2) additional annual \u201cproductivity adjustment\u201d reductions to the annual market basket payment update as\ndetermined by CMS for LTAC hospitals, IRFs, and nursing centers (beginning in federal fiscal year 2012), home health agencies (beginning in federal fiscal year 2015) and hospice providers (beginning in federal fiscal year 2013); (3) new transparency, reporting and certification requirements for nursing centers, including disclosures regarding organizational structure, officers, directors, trustees, managing employees and financial, clinical and other related data; (4) a quality reporting system for hospitals (including LTAC hospitals and IRFs) beginning in federal fiscal year 2014; and (5) reductions in Medicare payments to hospitals (including LTAC hospitals and IRFs) beginning in federal fiscal year 2014 for failure to meet certain quality reporting standards or to comply with standards in new value based purchasing demonstration project programs.\nFurther, the ACA mandates changes to home health and hospice benefits under Medicare. For home health, the ACA mandates creation of a value-based purchasing program, development of quality measures, a decrease in home health reimbursement beginning with federal fiscal year 2014 that will be phased-in over a four-year period, and a reduction in the outlier cap. In addition, the ACA requires the Secretary of HHS to test different models for delivery of care, some of which would involve home health services. It also requires the Secretary to establish a national pilot program for integrated care for patients with certain conditions, bundling payment for acute hospital care, physician services, outpatient hospital services (including emergency department services), and post-acute care services, which would include home health. The ACA further directed the Secretary of HHS to rebase payments for home health, which resulted in a decrease in home health reimbursement that began in 2014 and will be phased-in over a four-year period. The Secretary is also required to conduct a study to evaluate costs and quality of care among efficient home health agencies regarding access to care and treating Medicare beneficiaries with varying severity levels of illness and provide a report to Congress.\nIn addition, a primary goal of healthcare reform is to reduce costs, which includes reductions in the reimbursement paid to us and other healthcare providers. Moreover, healthcare reform could negatively impact insurance companies, other third party payors, our customers, as well as other healthcare providers, which may in turn negatively impact our business. As such, healthcare reforms and changes resulting from the ACA, as well as other similar healthcare reforms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nChanges in the reimbursement rates or methods or timing of payment from third party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursement for our services and products could result in a substantial reduction in our revenues and operating margins.\nWe depend on reimbursement from third party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, for a substantial portion of our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we derived approximately 51% of our total revenues (before eliminations) from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the balance from other third party payors, such as commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and contracted providers. The percentage of our revenues derived from the Medicare and Medicaid programs will increase following the Gentiva Merger. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. See \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nCongress continues to discuss deficit reduction measures, leading to a high degree of uncertainty regarding potential reforms to governmental healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These discussions, along with other continuing efforts to reform governmental healthcare programs, both as part of the ACA and otherwise, could result in major changes in the healthcare delivery and reimbursement system on a national and state level. Potential reforms include changes directly impacting the government and private reimbursement systems for each of our businesses. Reforms or other changes to the payment systems, including modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment, the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers, or bundling payments to cover acute and post-acute care or services provided to dually eligible Medicare and Medicaid patients may be proposed or could be adopted by Congress or CMS in the future.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 (as amended by the Taxpayer Relief Act) instituted an automatic 2% reduction on each claim submitted to Medicare beginning April 1, 2013. The Taxpayer Relief Act also reduces Medicare payments by an additional 25% for subsequent procedures when multiple therapy services are provided on the same day.\nOn August 1, 2012, CMS issued the 2012 CMS Rules which, among other things, reduced Medicare reimbursement to our TC hospitals in 2013 and beyond by imposing a budget neutrality adjustment and modifying the short-stay outlier rules. Effective December 29, 2012, the 2012 CMS Rules: (1) began a three-year phase-in of a 3.75% budget neutrality adjustment, which will reduce LTAC hospital rates by approximately 1.3% in each of 2013, 2014 and 2015; and (2) restored a payment reduction that will limit payments for very short-stay outliers that reduced our TC hospital payments by approximately 0.5%.\nOn July 29, 2011, CMS issued the 2011 CMS Rules which, among other things, significantly reduced Medicare payments to nursing centers and changed the reimbursement for the provision of group rehabilitation therapy services to Medicare beneficiaries beginning October 1, 2011. CMS projected the impact of these changes would result in an 11.1% decrease in payments to nursing centers. In addition to these rate changes, the 2011 CMS Rules introduced additional changes to RUG calculations along with adding additional patient assessments. Under the 2011 CMS Rules, group therapy is defined as therapy sessions with four patients who are performing similar therapy activities. In addition, for purposes of assigning patients to RUGs IV payment categories, the minutes of group therapy are divided by four with 25% of the minutes being allocated to each patient. The 2011 CMS Rules also clarify the\ncircumstances for reporting breaks in care of three or more days of therapy and also implement a new change of therapy assessment that is designed to allocate the patient to the RUG level that represents the treatment provided in the last seven days. Both changes produced alterations in the RUG scores billed for the patient and generated additional assessments. The 2011 CMS Rules reduced our revenues on an annual basis by approximately $100 million in our nursing center business and negatively impacted our rehabilitation therapy business by approximately $50 million.\nOn November 22, 2013, CMS issued final regulations regarding Medicare payment rates for home health agencies effective January 1, 2014. These final regulations implement a net 1.05% reduction consisting of a 2.3% market basket inflation increase, less (1) a 0.62% ICD-9 grouper refinement, and (2) a 2.73% rebasing adjustment mandated under the ACA. Rebasing the rates includes adjustments to the 60-day episode and per visit payment rates, the non-routine medical supply conversion factor and low utilization payment factors. The rebasing adjustment mandated under the ACA is expected to reduce payment rates by approximately 2.8% to our home health agencies in each of the next four years, beginning January 1, 2014.\nIn February 2012, Congress passed the Job Creation Act which provides for reductions in reimbursement of Medicare bad debts at our hospitals and nursing centers. For the hospitals, the bad debt reimbursement rate for all bad debts was lowered to 65% effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2012. For the nursing centers, the Job Creation Act provides for a phase-in of the reduction in the rate of reimbursement for bad debts of patients that are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. The rate of reimbursement for bad debts for these dually eligible patients was reduced from 88% to 76% in October 2013 and was reduced to 65% for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014. The rate of reimbursement for bad debts for patients not dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid was reduced from 70% to 65%, effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2012. Approximately 80% of our Medicare bad debt reimbursements incurred at our nursing centers are associated with patients that are dually eligible.\nWeak economic conditions also could adversely affect the budgets of individual states and of the federal government. This could result in attempts to reduce or eliminate payments for federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities. In addition, private third party payors are continuing their efforts to control healthcare costs through direct contracts with healthcare providers, increased utilization review and greater enrollment in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations. These private payors increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and are requesting that healthcare providers assume more financial risk.\nThough we cannot predict what reform proposals will be adopted or finally implemented, healthcare reform and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity through, among other things, decreasing funds available for our services or increasing operating costs. We could be affected adversely by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain healthcare costs. We cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third party payor programs, including Medicare supplemental insurance policies, will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs. Future changes in third party payor reimbursement rates or methods, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursement for our services and products could result in a material reduction in our revenues. Our operating margins continue to be under pressure because of reduced Medicare reimbursement, deterioration in pricing flexibility, changes in payor mix, changes in length of stay and growth in operating expenses in excess of increases in payments by third party payors. In addition, as a result of competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private patients or commercial payors remains limited. These results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe implementation of new patient criteria for LTAC hospitals under the LTAC Legislation will reduce the population of patients eligible for LTAC PPS and change the basis upon which we are paid which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nThe LTAC Legislation creates new Medicare criteria and payment rules for LTAC hospitals. Under the new criteria, LTAC hospitals treating patients with at least a three-day prior stay in an acute care hospital intensive care unit and patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation admitted from an acute care hospital will continue to receive payment under LTAC PPS. Other patients will continue to have access to LTAC care, whether they are admitted to LTAC hospitals from acute care hospitals or directly from other settings or the community. LTAC hospitals will be paid at a \u201csite-neutral\u201d rate for these patients, based on the lesser of per diem Medicare rates paid for patients with the same diagnoses under IPPS or LTAC costs.\nThe effective date of the new patient criteria is October 1, 2015, followed by a two-year phase-in period tied to each LTAC hospital\u2019s cost reporting period. During the phase-in period, payment for patients receiving the site neutral rate will be based 50% on the current LTAC PPS and 50% on the new site neutral rate. Nearly all of our TC hospitals (which are certified as LTAC hospitals under the Medicare program) have a cost reporting period starting on September 1 of each year. Accordingly, the phase-in will not begin for most of our TC hospitals until September 1, 2016 and full implementation of the new criteria will not begin until September 1, 2018.\nWe continue to analyze Medicare and internal data to estimate the number of our cases that will continue to be paid under the LTAC PPS rate. Currently, 70% of our LTAC patients are paid a full MS-LTC-DRG payment under LTAC PPS (with the remaining 30% paid under the short-stay or very short-stay outlier payment process). At this time, we estimate that approximately 30% of our current LTAC patients that are paid a full MS-LTC-DRG payment under LTAC PPS will be paid at the site neutral rate under the new criteria once it is fully phased-in. The site-neutral payment rates will be based on the lesser of per diem Medicare rates paid for patients with the same diagnoses under IPPS or LTAC costs. There can be no assurance that these site neutral payments will not be materially less than the payments currently provided under LTAC PPS.\nThe additional patient criteria imposed by LTAC Legislation will reduce the population of patients eligible for LTAC PPS and change the basis upon which we are paid for other patients. In addition, the LTAC Legislation will be subject to additional governmental regulations and the interpretation and enforcement of those regulations. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry, and changes in regulations, the enforcement of these regulations or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that reduce our revenues and profitability.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are subject regularly to inquiries and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable healthcare program participation and payment regulations. We also are subject to government investigations. We believe that the regulatory environment surrounding most segments of the healthcare industry will remain intense.\nThe extensive federal, state and local regulations affecting the healthcare industry include, but are not limited to, regulations relating to licensure, billing, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities, allowable costs, services and prices for services, facility staffing requirements, qualifications and licensure of staff, environmental and occupational health and safety, and the confidentiality and security of health-related information. In particular, various laws, including the anti-kickback, anti-fraud and abuse amendments codified under the Social Security Act, prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other governmental programs. Sanctions for violating the anti-kickback, anti-fraud and abuse amendments under the Social Security Act include criminal penalties, civil sanctions, fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. For additional information regarding our regulatory environment, see \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nFederal and state governments continue to pursue intensive enforcement policies resulting in a significant number of inspections, audits, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions including demands for refund of overpayments, terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, bans on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions and civil monetary penalties or criminal penalties. Audits under the CMS RAC program and other federal and state audits evaluating the medical necessity of services provided are expected to further intensify the regulatory environment surrounding the healthcare industry as third party firms engaged by CMS and others commence extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify improper payments to healthcare providers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and prohibitions applicable to our businesses, we could become ineligible to receive government program reimbursement, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations. In addition, we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to investigations, audits or other enforcement actions related to these laws, regulations or prohibitions. Furthermore, should we lose the licenses for one or more of our facilities as a result of regulatory action or otherwise, we could be in default under our Master Lease Agreements, the Credit Facilities and indentures governing our outstanding notes. Failure of our staff to satisfy applicable licensure requirements, or of our hospitals, IRFs, nursing centers, our rehabilitation operations, and home health and hospice operations, to satisfy applicable licensure and certification requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of federal and state enforcement actions. Changes in the regulatory framework, including those associated with healthcare reform, and sanctions from various enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe face and are currently subject to reviews, audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies and other payors, and these reviews, audits and investigations could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we face and are currently subject to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. An increasing level of governmental and private resources is being devoted to the investigation of allegations of fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and federal and state regulatory authorities are taking an increasingly strict view of the requirements imposed on healthcare providers by the Social Security Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other applicable laws. We are routinely subject to audits under various government programs, including the RAC program, in which third party firms\nengaged by CMS conduct extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify potential improper payments to healthcare providers under the Medicare program.\nIn addition, we, like other hospital and nursing center operators and rehabilitation therapy service providers, are subject to ongoing investigations by the OIG, the DOJ and state attorneys general into the billing of rehabilitation and other services provided to Medicare and Medicaid patients, including whether rehabilitation therapy services were properly documented and billed, whether services provided were medically necessary and general compliance with conditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Negative findings from these investigations could also lead to potential indemnification claims asserted by our rehabilitation division customers.\nPrivate pay sources such as third party insurance and managed care entities also often reserve the right to conduct audits. Our costs to respond to and defend reviews, audits and investigations are significant and are likely to increase in the current enforcement environment. These audits and investigations may require us to refund or retroactively adjust amounts that have been paid under the relevant government program or from other payors. Moreover, an adverse review, audit or investigation also could result in other adverse consequences, particularly if the underlying conduct is found to be pervasive or systemic. These consequences include:\n\u2022\nstate or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n\u2022\nloss of our right to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or one or more third party payor networks;\n\u2022\nindemnity claims asserted by customers and others for which we provide services; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation in various markets, which could adversely affect our ability to attract patients, residents\nand employees.\nIf they were to occur, these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. See note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of pending legal proceedings, governmental reviews, audits and investigations to which we are subject. See also note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of pending legal proceedings, governmental reviews, audits and investigations to which Gentiva is subject.\nSignificant legal actions could subject us to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe incur significant costs to investigate and defend against a variety of claims, including professional liability, wage and hour, and minimum staffing claims, among others, particularly in our hospital and nursing center operations. In addition to large compensatory claims, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are increasingly seeking, and have sometimes been successful in obtaining, significant fines, punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. Furthermore, there are continuing efforts to limit the ability of healthcare providers to utilize arbitration as a process to resolve these claims. As a result of these factors, our defense costs and potential liability exposure are significant, unpredictable, and likely to increase.\nWe also are subject to lawsuits under the FCA and comparable state laws for submitting fraudulent bills for services to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs. These lawsuits, which may be initiated by \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys\u2019 fees and the award of bounties to private qui tam plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits and to the government programs. We also are subject to payment obligations under contracts we enter into with our rehabilitation division customers to indemnify them against claim denials associated with our services.\nWhile we are able to insure against certain of these costs and liabilities, such as our professional liability risks described below, we are not able to do so in many other cases. In the absence of insurance proceeds, we must fund these costs and liabilities from operating cash flows, which can reduce our operating margins and our funds available for investment in our business, and otherwise limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nWe insure a substantial portion of our professional liability risks primarily through our limited purpose insurance subsidiary. Provisions for loss for our professional liability risks are based upon management\u2019s best available information including actuarially determined estimates. The allowance for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the expected cost to settle reported claims and an amount, based upon past experiences, for losses incurred but not reported. These liabilities are necessarily based upon estimates and, while management believes that the provision for loss is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amounts recorded. Changes in the number of professional liability claims and the cost to settle these claims significantly impact the allowance for professional liability risks. A relatively small variance between our estimated and actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact, either favorable or unfavorable, on the adequacy of the allowance for professional liability risks. Differences between the ultimate claims costs and our historical provisions for loss and actuarial assumptions and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. See note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of pending legal proceedings, governmental reviews,\naudits and investigations to which we are subject. See also note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of pending legal proceedings, governmental reviews, audits and investigations to which Gentiva is subject.\nWe are subject to extensive and complex federal and state government laws and regulations which govern and restrict our relationships with physicians and other referral sources.\nThe Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, the FCA and similar state laws materially restrict our relationships with physicians and other referral sources. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our healthcare facilities, and these laws govern those relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the safe harbors, most of our current arrangements, including with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-Kickback Statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. However, we cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be brought under federal civil monetary penalty laws, which require a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute.\nOur financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.\nAdditionally, if we violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a qui tam, or \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d lawsuit.\nIf we fail to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, the FCA or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities or healthcare activities), exclusion of one or more facilities or healthcare activities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs and, for violations of certain laws, regulations and criminal penalties.\nWe do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity, and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be adopted that adversely affect our business.\nFuture cost containment initiatives undertaken by third party payors may limit our revenues and profitability.\nInitiatives undertaken by major insurers and managed care companies to contain healthcare costs or to respond to healthcare reform could affect the profitability of our services. These payors attempt to control healthcare costs by contracting with providers of healthcare to obtain services on a discounted basis. We believe that this trend will continue and intensify and may further limit reimbursements for healthcare services. If insurers or managed care companies from whom we receive substantial payments reduce the amounts they pay for services or limit access to our services, our profit margins may decline, or we may lose patients if we choose not to renew our contracts with these insurers at lower rates. These results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nFurther consolidation of managed care organizations and other third party payors may adversely affect our profits.\nManaged care organizations and other third party payors have continued to consolidate in order to enhance their ability to influence the delivery and cost structure of healthcare services. Consequently, the healthcare needs of a large percentage of the United States population are increasingly served by a smaller number of managed care organizations. These organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers for needed services. In addition, third party payors, including managed care payors, increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures. To the extent that these organizations terminate us as a preferred provider, engage our competitors as a preferred or exclusive provider, demand discounted fee structures or seek our assumption of all or a portion of the financial risk through a prepaid capitation arrangement, our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our TC hospitals fail to maintain their certification as LTAC hospitals, our revenues and profitability could decline.\nIf our TC hospitals, satellite TC facilities or HIHs fail to meet or maintain the standards for certification as LTAC hospitals, such as average minimum length of patient stay, they will receive payments under IPPS rather than payment under the system applicable to LTAC hospitals. Payments at rates applicable to general acute care hospitals would result in our TC hospitals receiving less Medicare reimbursement than they currently receive for patient services and our profitability would decline. To maintain certification under LTAC PPS, the average length of stay of Medicare patients must be greater than 25 days. Medicare Advantage patients are included with Medicare fee-for-service patients in order to determine compliance with the 25 day average length of stay requirements. Under the LTAC Legislation, the average Medicare 25-day length of stay rule will remain in effect for patients paid for under the new Medicare LTAC payment system. However, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015, the 25-day requirement will not apply to patients receiving the site neutral rate or to Medicare Advantage patients treated in LTAC hospitals.\nBeginning in 2020, the LTAC Legislation requires that at least 50% of our patients must be paid under the new LTAC payment system to maintain Medicare certification as a LTAC hospital. Under the new criteria, LTAC hospitals treating patients with at least a three-day prior stay in an acute care hospital intensive care unit and patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation admitted from an acute care hospital will continue to receive payment under LTAC PPS.\nThe failure of one or more of our TC hospitals to maintain its Medicare certification as a LTAC hospital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nExpiration of the moratorium imposed on certain federal regulations otherwise applicable to LTAC hospitals, including HIHs and satellite hospitals, could have an adverse effect on our future revenues and profitability.\nCMS has regulations governing payments to LTAC hospitals that are co-located with another hospital, such as a HIH. The rules generally limit Medicare payments to the HIH if the Medicare admissions to the HIH from its co-located hospital exceed 25% of the total Medicare discharges for the HIH\u2019s cost reporting period. There are limited exceptions for admissions from rural hospitals, urban single hospitals and MSA Dominant hospitals. Patients transferred after they have reached the short-term acute care outlier payment status are not counted toward the admission threshold. Patients admitted prior to meeting the admission threshold, as well as Medicare patients admitted from a non co-located hospital, are eligible for the full payment under LTAC PPS. If the HIH\u2019s admissions from the co-located hospital exceed the limit in a cost reporting period, Medicare will pay the lesser of: (1) the amount payable under LTAC PPS or (2) the amount payable under IPPS, which likely will reduce our revenues for such admissions. At December 31, 2014, we operated 20 HIHs with 768 licensed beds.\nIn 2007, CMS issued the 2007 Final Rule which expanded the policy known as the \u201c25 Percent Rule\u201d to all LTAC hospitals, regardless of whether they are a HIH. Under this rule, all LTAC hospitals were to be paid LTAC PPS rates for admissions from a single referral source up to 25% of aggregate Medicare admissions. Patients reaching high cost outlier status in the short-term hospital were not to be counted when computing the 25% limit. Admissions beyond the 25% threshold were to be paid at a lower amount based upon IPPS rates.\nSince 2007, various legislative enactments have created moratoriums on the expansion of the \u201c25 Percent Rule\u201d to freestanding LTAC hospitals. The LTAC Legislation extends the moratorium on the expansion of the \u201c25 Percent Rule\u201d to LTAC hospitals certified prior to October 1, 2004 for four years. LTAC hospitals certified after October 1, 2004 continue to be ineligible for relief from the \u201c25 Percent Rule.\u201d Freestanding LTAC hospitals will not be subject to the \u201c25 Percent Rule\u201d payment adjustment until cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2016. In addition, for cost reporting periods beginning before October 1, 2016: (1) LTAC hospitals may admit up to 50% of their patients from a co-located hospital and still be paid according to LTAC PPS; and (2) LTAC hospitals that are co-located with an urban single hospital or a MSA Dominant hospital may admit up to 75% of their patients from such urban single or MSA Dominant hospital and still be paid according to LTAC PPS. The LTAC Legislation further provides that co-located LTAC hospitals certified on or before September 30, 1995 are exempt from the provisions of the \u201c25 Percent Rule.\u201d The LTAC Legislation also mandates that the Secretary of the HHS report to Congress by July 1, 2015 on whether the \u201c25 Percent Rule\u201d should continue to be applied.\nSince these rules are complex and are based upon the volume of Medicare admissions and the source of those admissions, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on our future revenues or operations from these regulations. If the \u201c25 Percent Rule\u201d is ultimately fully implemented, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe moratorium on the Medicare certification of new LTAC hospitals and beds in existing LTAC hospitals limits our ability to increase LTAC hospital bed capacity, expand into new areas or increase services in existing areas we serve.\nThe LTAC Legislation, as amended by PAMA, imposes a moratorium from April 1, 2014 through September 30, 2017 on the establishment and classification of new LTAC hospitals, LTAC satellite facilities and LTAC beds in existing LTAC hospitals or satellite hospitals, subject to certain exceptions. This moratorium limits our ability to increase LTAC bed capacity, expand into new areas or increase bed capacity in existing markets that we serve.\nHealthcare reform and other regulations could adversely affect the liquidity of our customers, which could have an adverse effect on their ability to make timely payments to us for our products and services.\nThe ACA and other laws and regulations that limit or restrict Medicare and Medicaid payments to our customers could adversely impact the liquidity of our customers, resulting in their inability to pay us, or to timely pay us, for our products and services. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations they could be subject to possible sanctions, including loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs, as well as civil and criminal penalties. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf we do not manage admissions in the IRFs that we operate or manage in compliance with a 60% threshold, reimbursement for services rendered by us in these facilities will be based upon less favorable rates.\nIRFs are subject to a requirement that 60% or more of the patients admitted to the facilities have one or more of 13 specific conditions in order to qualify for the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospectus payment system. If that compliance threshold is not maintained, the IRF will be reimbursed at the lower prospective payment system applicable to acute care hospitals. That may lead to reduced revenue in the IRFs that we operate or manage and also may lead customers of IRFs to attempt to renegotiate the terms of their contracts or terminate their contracts, in either case adversely affecting the projected revenues and profitability we expect.\nIf we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.\nThere are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the privacy and security rules under HIPAA protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most uses and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. If we are found to be in violation of the privacy or security rules under HIPAA or other federal or state laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could be subject to sanctions and civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nApproximately 20% of our hospice revenues are derived from patients who reside in skilled nursing facilities. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and \u201croom and board\u201d provided to hospice patients residing in skilled nursing facilities could reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability.\nFor hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare or Medicaid, the state must pay, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem skilled nursing facility rate for \u201croom and board\u201d furnished to the patient by the skilled nursing facility. The reduction or elimination of Medicare payments for hospice patients residing in skilled nursing facilities would significantly reduce our home health and hospice revenues and profitability. In addition, changes in the way skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed for \u201croom and board\u201d services provided to hospice patients residing in skilled nursing facilities could affect our ability to obtain referrals from skilled nursing facilities. A reduction in referrals from skilled nursing facilities would adversely affect our home health and hospice revenues and profitability.\nRisks Relating to the Gentiva Merger\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate Gentiva\u2019s operations with our own or realize the anticipated benefits of the Gentiva Merger, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate Gentiva\u2019s operations with our own, and we may not realize all or any of the expected benefits of the Gentiva Merger as and when planned. The integration of Gentiva\u2019s operations with ours will be complex, costly and time consuming. We expect that it will require significant attention from senior management and will impose substantial demands on our operations and personnel, potentially diverting attention from other important pending projects. The difficulties and risks associated with the integration of Gentiva include:\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we will fail to implement our business plans for the combined company, including as a result of new legislation or regulation in the healthcare industry affecting the timing or costs associated with the operations of the combined company or its integration plan;\n\u2022\npossible inconsistencies in the standards, controls, procedures, policies and compensation structures between us and Gentiva;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may have failed to discover liabilities of Gentiva during our due diligence investigation as part of the Gentiva Merger for which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible;\n\u2022\nlimitations prior to the completion of the Gentiva Merger on the ability of our and Gentiva\u2019s management to\nwork together to develop an integration plan;\n\u2022\nthe increased scope and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees and the costs associated with our efforts to retain key employees;\n\u2022\nprovisions in our and Gentiva\u2019s contracts with third parties that may limit our flexibility to take certain actions;\n\u2022\nrisks and limitations on our ability to consolidate corporate and administrative infrastructures of the two companies;\n\u2022\nobligations that we will have to counterparties of Gentiva that arise as result of the change in control of Gentiva; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility of unanticipated delays, costs or inefficiencies associated with the integration of Gentiva\u2019s operations with ours.\nAs a result of these difficulties and risks, we may not accomplish the integration of Gentiva\u2019s business smoothly, successfully or within our budgetary expectations and anticipated timetable. Accordingly, we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Gentiva Merger, such as increase in our scale, diversification, cash flows and operational efficiency and accretion to our earnings per share.\nThe Gentiva Merger may not achieve its intended results, including anticipated synergies.\nWhile we expect the Gentiva Merger to result in a significant amount of synergies and other financial and operational benefits, we may be unable to realize these synergies or other benefits in the timeframe that we expect or at all. Achieving the anticipated benefits, including synergies, is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses acquired can be operated in the manner we intend and whether our costs to integrate the businesses will be consistent with our expectations. Events outside of our control, including, but not limited to, any conditions imposed by governmental authorities, operating changes or regulatory changes, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the Gentiva Merger. Thus, the integration may be unpredictable, or subject to delays or changed circumstances, and the acquired businesses may not perform in accordance with our expectations. Further, we will incur implementation costs relative to these anticipated synergies, and our expectations with respect to integration or synergies as a result of the Gentiva Merger may not materialize. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on our anticipated synergies. See \u201c- We may not be able to successfully integrate Gentiva\u2019s operations with our own or realize the anticipated benefits of the Gentiva Merger, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\u201d\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction and Gentiva Merger-related integration costs in connection with the Gentiva Merger.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of costs associated with completing the Gentiva Merger and integrating our and Gentiva\u2019s operations. Such costs include costs associated with borrowings under or amendments to the Credit Facilities, any premiums in connection with refinancing Gentiva\u2019s debt and the payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Gentiva Merger and related Financing Transactions, including legal and other professional advisor fees. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses and will primarily consist of transaction costs related to the Gentiva Merger, facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our and Gentiva\u2019s businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nWe have incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the Gentiva Merger and may not be able to meet our substantial debt service requirements.\nA substantial portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest obligations on our outstanding indebtedness. Subject to certain restrictions, we also have the ability to incur substantial additional borrowings. In addition, we have incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the Gentiva Merger. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds to meet our obligations under our outstanding notes or our Credit Facilities (including as a result of the Gentiva Merger), we may be required to refinance, restructure or otherwise amend some or all of such obligations, sell assets or raise additional cash through the sale of our equity. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such refinancing on terms as favorable as our current financing or that such restructuring, sales of assets or issuances of equity can be accomplished or, if accomplished, would raise sufficient funds to meet these obligations. See \u201c- Risk Factors Relating to Our Indebtedness - Our indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\u201d\nThe Gentiva Merger substantially increases our scale, which will change the risks to which we are subject.\nGentiva is a large and complex company that significantly adds to the size and scale of our operations. Gentiva had approximately $2 billion in net revenues for 2014 and approximately $1.2 billion in total assets at December 31, 2014. It has made numerous acquisitions and operated at 491 locations in 40 states, which could expose us to increased integration, operational, employee management and regulatory risks. Further, after giving effect to the Gentiva Merger, the percentage of our revenues derived from the Medicare and Medicaid programs will increase. See \u201cRisks Relating to Reimbursement and Regulation of Our Business - Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods or timing of payment from third party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursement for our services and products could result in a substantial reduction in our revenues and operating margins\u201d and \u201cRisks Relating to Our Operations - Possible changes in the acuity of residents and patients, as well as payor mix and payment methodologies, may significantly affect our profitability.\u201d We may have failed to identify all the risks to which the acquisition of Gentiva may expose us or the effects it may have on the price of our shares or on our long-term value, including any risks related to Gentiva\u2019s compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, contractual obligations and leases and those related to changes in Medicare reimbursement.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms of Gentiva\u2019s Corporate Integrity Agreement, it could subject us to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or termination from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nGentiva entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (\u201cCIA\u201d) with the OIG, which became effective on February 15, 2012, concurrent with the execution of a settlement agreement with the United States, acting through the DOJ and on behalf of the OIG. The CIA imposes certain compliance, auditing (including by an independent review organization), self-reporting and training requirements with which we, as a result of the Gentiva Merger, must comply. If we fail to comply with the terms of the CIA, it could subject us to substantial monetary penalties and/or suspension or termination from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The imposition of monetary penalties would adversely affect our profitability. For example, in connection with the auditing imposed by the CIA, Gentiva recognized negative adjustments to its revenues due to repayments. A suspension or termination of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nGentiva is subject to certain ongoing investigations, and periodic audits and requests for information by the Medicare and Medicaid programs or government agencies, which have various rights and remedies against us if they assert that Gentiva has overcharged the programs or failed to comply with program requirements.\nGentiva\u2019s operations are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers, including laws containing criminal provisions, which prohibit filing false claims or making false statements in order to receive payment or obtain certification under Medicare and Medicaid programs, or failing to refund overpayments or improper payments. Violation of these criminal provisions is a felony punishable by imprisonment and/or fines. We may also be subject to fines, treble damage claims and exclusion as a provider under the Medicare or Medicaid programs if Gentiva has violated the civil provisions that prohibit knowingly filing a false claim or knowingly using false statements to obtain payment.\nAdditionally, the ACA requires providers, such as home health agencies and hospice providers, to notify the Secretary of the HHS, fiscal intermediary, contractor or other appropriate person of any overpayment and the reason for the overpayment, and to return the overpayment, within the later of 60 days from the time the overpayment is identified or the due date of the provider\u2019s cost report. Failure to comply may result in prosecution under the FCA and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs.\nCMS has contracted with various third party administrators (\u201cTPAs\u201d), including RACs and others, to perform post-payment reviews of healthcare providers. Various states have also begun to engage TPAs to conduct post-payment reviews of Medicaid claims data. We expect in the future that CMS and the states will likely expand the scope of the reviews conducted by these TPAs. We cannot predict whether reviews by TPAs of Gentiva\u2019s home health and hospice programs\u2019 reimbursement claims will result in material recoupments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nAlthough Gentiva believes it has established policies and procedures that are sufficient to help ensure that it will operate in substantial compliance with anti-fraud and abuse requirements, in the future, different interpretations or enforcement of laws, rules and regulations governing the healthcare industry could subject Gentiva\u2019s business practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require Gentiva to make changes in its facilities, equipment, personnel, services and capital expenditure programs, increase its operating expenses and distract its management. If Gentiva fails to comply with these extensive laws and government regulations, we could become ineligible to receive government program payments, suffer civil and criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to Gentiva\u2019s operations. In addition, we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under these laws or regulations. See note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of pending legal proceedings, governmental reviews, audits and investigations to which Gentiva is subject.\nAn adverse ruling against Gentiva in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGentiva is involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business, including a collective and class action lawsuit alleging violations by Gentiva of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act and a putative shareholder class action lawsuit alleging violations by Gentiva of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and may be subject to additional lawsuits in the future. The damages claimed against Gentiva in such litigation are substantial.\nWe cannot assure you that Gentiva will prevail in the pending cases. In addition to the possibility of an adverse outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management\u2019s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and results of our operations. See note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of pending legal proceedings, governmental reviews, audits and investigations to which Gentiva is subject.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, we had total indebtedness of approximately $2.9 billion in addition to the availability of approximately $617 million under the ABL Facility (subject to a borrowing base and after giving effect to approximately $5 million of letters of credit outstanding on December 31, 2014). The Gentiva Merger and the Centerre Acquisition significantly increased our aggregate indebtedness. As of February 2, 2015, after the closing of the Gentiva Merger, we had:\n\u2022\n$1.46 billion of senior secured indebtedness under the Credit Facilities, which included approximately $464 million related to the ABL Facility;\n\u2022\n$500 million of senior unsecured indebtedness under the Notes due 2022;\n\u2022\n$600 million of senior unsecured indebtedness under the Notes due 2023;\n\u2022\n$750 million of senior unsecured indebtedness under the Notes due 2020;\n\u2022\n$35 million of Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Stock as part of the Units;\n\u2022\napproximately $244 million available for borrowing under the ABL Facility (subject to a borrowing base and after giving effect to approximately $63 million of letters of credit outstanding) which, if borrowed, would be senior secured indebtedness;\n\u2022\nGentiva held approximately $90 million of unrestricted cash on hand; and\n\u2022\nsubject to our compliance with certain covenants and other conditions, we have the option to incur certain additional secured indebtedness and/or additional unsecured indebtedness which would rank pari passu with the outstanding notes.\nOur substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nexpose us to fluctuations in the interest rate environment because the interest rates under the Credit Facilities\nare variable;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness,\nthereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,\ndividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other\ngeneral corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate,\nwhich may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nrestrict us from pursuing business opportunities.\nOur indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations.\nThe terms of the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries, including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge;\n\u2022\nsell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\npay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans, advances and acquisitions.\nThe terms of the Credit Facilities also include certain additional restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries, including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nengage in business other than relating to owning, operating or managing healthcare facilities;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and lease-back transactions;\n\u2022\nmodify certain agreements;\n\u2022\nmake or incur capital expenditures; and\n\u2022\nhold cash and temporary cash investments outside of collateral accounts.\nIn addition, the Credit Facilities require us to comply with financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.\nOur ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Credit Facilities or the indentures governing our outstanding notes.\nWe, including our subsidiaries, have the ability to incur substantially more indebtedness, including senior secured indebtedness, which could further increase the risks associated with our leverage.\nSubject to the restrictions in the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes, we have the ability to incur significant additional indebtedness. Although the terms of the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes include restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we incur significant additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face could increase.\nOur failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes, we may not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the Credit Facilities and the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument also could result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments or under the Master Lease\nAgreements. Moreover, counterparties to some of the contracts material to our business may have the right to amend or terminate those contracts if we have an event of default or a declaration of acceleration under certain of our indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to pay rents related to our leased properties and service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nA substantial portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to the payment of rents related to our leased properties, as well as principal and interest obligations on our outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn addition, our Master Lease Agreements and/or our outstanding indebtedness:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our rent and interest obligations,\nthereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general\ncorporate activities, including cash dividends;\n\u2022\nrequire us to pledge as collateral substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nrequire us to maintain a certain defined fixed coverage ratio above a specified level and a certain defined total\nindebtedness ratio below a specified level, thereby reducing our financial flexibility;\n\u2022\nrequire us to limit the amount of capital expenditures we can incur in any fiscal year; and\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to discontinue the operation of any leased property despite its level of profitability and otherwise\nrestrict our operational flexibility.\nThese provisions:\n\u2022\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to withstand competitive pressures or adverse economic\nconditions (including adverse regulatory changes);\n\u2022\ncould adversely affect our ability to make material acquisitions, obtain future financing or take advantage of\nbusiness opportunities that may arise;\n\u2022\ncould increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business; and\n\u2022\ncould adversely affect our ability to continue to make cash dividends.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates. Interest rate changes could affect the amount of our interest payments, and accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facilities, we have entered into interest rate swaps that fix a portion of our interest rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility; however, any interest rate swaps we enter into do not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. As a result, an increase in interest rates, whether because of an increase in market interest rates or an increase in our own cost of borrowing, would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability. For example, a change of one-eighth percent in the interest rates for the Credit Facilities would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately $2 million.\nOur failure to pay rent or otherwise comply with the provisions of any of our Master Lease Agreements could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nAs of December, 2014, we lease 38 of our TC hospitals and 45 of our nursing centers from Ventas under our Master Lease Agreements. Our failure to pay the rent or otherwise comply with the provisions of any of our Master Lease Agreements would result in an \u201cevent of default\u201d under such Master Lease Agreement and also could result in a default under the Credit Facilities and, if repayment of the borrowings under the Credit Facilities were accelerated, also under the indentures governing our outstanding notes. Upon an event of default, remedies available to Ventas include, without limitation, terminating such Master Lease Agreement, repossessing and reletting the leased properties and requiring us to remain liable for all obligations under such Master Lease Agreement, including the difference between the rent under such Master Lease Agreement and the rent payable as a result of reletting the leased properties, or requiring us to pay the net present value of the rent due for the balance of the term of such Master Lease Agreement. The exercise of such remedies would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nFor additional information on the Master Lease Agreements, see \u201cPart I - Item 1 - Business - Master Lease Agreements.\u201d\nRepayment of our indebtedness is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiaries own a significant portion of our assets and conduct a significant portion of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Certain of our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness.\nRisks Relating to Kindred\u2019s Capital and Liquidity\nThe market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly, and it may trade at prices below the price at which you purchased our Common Stock.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly from time to time as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nregulatory and/or reimbursement changes applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nquarterly or other periodic variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nadverse outcomes from litigation and/or government, regulatory or internal investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nnational, regional and industry-specific economic, financial, business and political conditions;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable;\n\u2022\npress releases or negative publicity relating to our competitors or us or relating to trends in healthcare;\n\u2022\nsales of stock by insiders;\n\u2022\nissuance of additional shares of Common Stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in our credit ratings;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, terrorist attacks and pandemics; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to repurchase our Common Stock.\nBroad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, security holders often institute class action litigation following periods of volatility in the price of a company\u2019s securities. If the market value of our Common Stock experiences adverse fluctuations and we become a party to this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, causing our business to decline.\nFuture issuances or sales of our shares could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nFuture sales of our Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of our Common Stock, in the public market, whether by us or our existing stockholders, future issuances of additional shares of Common Stock in connection with any future acquisitions or pursuant to employee benefit plans and future issuances of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of options or warrants, or the perception that such sales, issuances and/or exercises or conversions could occur, may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock, which could decline significantly. Sales by our existing shareholders might also make it more difficult for us to raise equity capital by selling new Common Stock at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nAs part of the Financing Transactions, we issued 172,500 Units. Each Unit is composed of a Purchase Contract and one share of Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Stock. Unless settled or redeemed earlier, each Purchase Contract will automatically settle on December 1, 2017 (subject to postponement in certain limited circumstances) and we will deliver a number of shares of our Common Stock based on the applicable market value of our Common Stock. Holders of Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Stock are entitled to receive a quarterly \u201cpreferred stock installment payment,\u201d which we may choose to pay in cash, shares of our Common Stock or combination thereof.\nWe may issue additional Common Stock in the future in connection with capital raisings, acquisitions, strategic transactions, settlement or redemption of the Purchase Contracts included in the Units, our option to pay preferred stock installment payments under the Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Stock in shares of Common Stock, or for other purposes. To the extent we issue substantial additional Common Stock, the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted and our earnings per share could be reduced, which may negatively affect the market price for our Common Stock.\nWe may not be able to continue paying a regular dividend and the failure to do so could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur ability to continue paying regular dividends is based on many factors, including the success of our operations, the level of demand for our services, the level of payments for our services, changes in healthcare regulations and our liquidity needs that may vary substantially from our estimates. Many of these factors are beyond our control and a change in any such factor could affect our ability to pay or maintain dividends. In addition, the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and may prevent further dividends if we are in default under any of those agreements. The failure to continue paying regular dividends could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur issuance of preferred stock may cause the Common Stock price to decline, which may negatively impact your investment.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue series of shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such series of shares of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, conversion rights, dividend rights, preferences over Common Stock with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and other terms. The Units we issued as part of the Financing Transactions consist of Purchase Contracts and shares of Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Stock. The Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Stock and any other preferred stock we may issue in the future will rank senior to all of our Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. If we issue cumulative preferred stock in the future that has preference over Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of Common Stock, the market price of Common Stock could decrease, which may negatively impact your investment.\nThe condition of the financial markets, including volatility and weakness in the equity, capital and credit markets, could limit the availability and terms of debt and equity financing sources to fund the capital and liquidity requirements of our businesses.\nFinancial markets experienced significant disruptions over the past several years. These disruptions impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, significantly reduced the availability of certain types of debt financing. Despite the instability over the past several years within the financial markets nationally and globally, we have not experienced any individual lender limitations to extend credit under the Credit Facilities. However, the obligations of each of the lending institutions in the ABL Facility are separate and the availability of future borrowings under the ABL Facility could be impacted by volatility and disruptions in the financial credit markets or other events. We cannot assure you that a prolonged downturn in the credit markets or other circumstances will not impact our ability to access or to refinance the Credit Facilities. Our inability to access or refinance the Credit Facilities would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe Credit Facilities are collateralized by substantially all of our assets including certain owned real property and is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. The terms of the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes include financial covenants and certain other provisions that limit acquisitions and annual capital expenditures. We were in compliance with the terms of the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes at December 31, 2014. However, a downturn in operating earnings or events beyond our control could impair our ability to comply with the covenants contained within the Credit\nFacilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. If we anticipated a potential financial or other covenant violation, however, we would seek relief from our lenders for the Credit Facilities and the holders of the outstanding notes, which likely would include costs to us, and such relief may not be on terms as favorable as those in the Credit Facilities or the outstanding notes, as applicable. Under these circumstances, there is also the potential that our lenders under the Credit Facilities or the holders of the outstanding notes would not grant relief to us. A default due to the violation of a financial or other covenant contained within the Credit Facilities, the indentures governing the outstanding notes or the occurrence of an \u201cevent of default\u201d under the Master Lease Agreements could require us to immediately repay all amounts then outstanding under the Credit Facilities and the outstanding notes.\nIf we have future capital needs that cannot be funded from operating cash flows, any future issuances of equity securities may dilute the value of our Common Stock and any additional issuances of debt may increase our leverage.\nWe may need additional capital if a substantial acquisition or other growth opportunity becomes available or if unexpected events occur or opportunities arise. We cannot assure you that additional capital will be available, or available on terms favorable to us. If capital is not available, we may not be able to fund internal or external business expansion or respond to competitive pressures or other market conditions. If available, we may obtain additional capital through the public or private sale of debt or equity securities. However, our ability to access the public debt or equity capital markets, on terms favorable to us or at all, may be limited by further disruptions in these markets or other events. If we sell equity securities, the transaction could be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Furthermore, these securities could have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Common Stock. If we incur additional debt, our leverage may increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could negatively impact our investment portfolio.\nWe hold a substantial investment portfolio in our limited purpose insurance subsidiary. Investments held in our limited purpose insurance subsidiary consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, debt securities, equities and certificates of deposit that are held to satisfy the payment of claims and expenses related to professional liability and workers compensation risks. Our investment policy governing insurance subsidiary investments precludes the investment portfolio managers from selling any security at a loss without prior authorization from us. The investment managers also limit the exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of investment. We intend, and have the ability, to hold insurance subsidiary investments for a long duration without the necessity of selling securities to fund the underwriting needs of our insurance subsidiary. This ability to hold securities allows sufficient time for recovery of temporary declines in the market value of equity securities and the par value of debt securities as of their stated maturity date. We cannot assure you, however, that we will recover declines in the market value of our investments. There is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in the future. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that declines in the market value of our investments will not require us to further capitalize our limited purpose insurance subsidiary or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nFederal, state and local employment-related laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business and subject us to significant back pay awards, fines and lawsuits.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local employment-related laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, the Family Medical Leave Act, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping and other working conditions, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the ACA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, regulations of the Office of Civil Rights, regulations of the Department of Labor, regulations of state attorneys general, federal and state wage and hour laws, and a variety of similar laws enacted by the federal and state governments that govern these and other employment-related matters. Because labor represents such a large portion of our operating costs, compliance with these evolving federal and state laws and regulations could substantially increase our cost of doing business while failure to do so could subject us to significant back pay awards, fines and lawsuits. We are currently subject to employee-related claims, class actions and other lawsuits and proceedings in connection with our operations, including, but not limited to, those related to alleged wrongful discharge, illegal discrimination and violations of equal employment and federal and state wage and hour laws. These claims, lawsuits and proceedings are in various stages of adjudication or investigation and involve a wide variety of claims and potential outcomes. In addition, federal proposals to introduce a system of mandated health insurance and flexible work time and other similar initiatives could, if implemented, adversely affect our operations. Our failure to comply with federal and state employment-related laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. See note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of pending legal proceedings, governmental reviews, audits and investigations to which we are subject. See also note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of pending legal proceedings, governmental reviews, audits and investigations to which Gentiva is subject.\nWe could experience significant legal actions, fines and increases in our operating costs if we fail to comply with state minimum staffing requirements.\nVarious states in which we operate hospitals and nursing centers have established minimum staffing requirements or may establish minimum staffing requirements in the future. Staffing requirements in some states are not contingent upon any additional appropriation of state funds in any budget act or other statute. Our ability to satisfy such staffing requirements will, among other things, depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals.\nWhile we seek to comply with all applicable staffing requirements, the regulations in this area are complex and we may experience compliance issues from time to time. Failure to comply with such minimum staffing requirements may result in one or more facilities failing to meet the conditions of participation under relevant federal and state healthcare programs and the imposition of fines or other sanctions. In addition, private litigation involving these matters also has become more common.\nMoreover, a portion of the staffing costs we incur is funded by states through Medicaid program appropriations or otherwise. If states do not appropriate sufficient additional funds to pay for any additional operating costs resulting from such minimum staffing requirements, our profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain insurance, or if insurance becomes more costly for us to obtain, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe insure a substantial portion of our professional liability risks primarily through our limited purpose insurance subsidiary. Our limited purpose insurance subsidiary covers losses up to specified limits per occurrence. On a per claim basis, coverage for losses in excess of those insured by the limited purpose insurance subsidiary are maintained through unaffiliated commercial reinsurance carriers. Our limited purpose insurance subsidiary insures all claims in all states up to a per occurrence limit without the benefit of any aggregate stop loss limit. We maintain professional and general liability insurance in amounts and coverage that management believes are sufficient for our operations. However, our insurance may not cover all claims against us or the full extent of our liability nor continue to be available at a reasonable cost. Moreover, the cost of reinsurance coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers is costly and may continue to increase. There can be no assurances that in the future reinsurance will be available at a reasonable price or that we will be able to maintain adequate levels of professional and general liability insurance coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages that are uninsured, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nCertain events or circumstances could result in the impairment of our assets or other charges, including, without limitation, impairments of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that result in material charges to earnings.\nWe review the carrying value of certain long-lived assets, finite lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate an impairment or an adjustment to the amortization period may be necessary, such as when the market value of our Common Stock is below book equity value. On an ongoing basis, we also evaluate, based upon the fair value of our reporting units, whether the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired. If circumstances suggest that the recorded amounts of any of these assets cannot be recovered based upon estimated future cash flows, the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value. If the carrying value of any of these assets is impaired, we may incur a material charge to earnings. We will have a significant increase in goodwill and identifiable intangible assets as a result of the Gentiva Merger.\nDuring 2013, we determined that pretax impairment charges aggregating $77 million were necessary, which included $76 million of goodwill and $1 million of property and equipment. The goodwill impairment charge was directly related to a Medicare rebasing adjustment for payments to home health providers which will reduce the payment rate by approximately 2.8% in each of the next four years beginning on January 1, 2014. The property and equipment impairment charge was related to the 2011 CMS Rules, which significantly reduced Medicare payments to our skilled nursing rehabilitation services operating segment and our nursing centers.\nDuring 2012, we determined that pretax impairment charges aggregating $109 million were necessary, which included $108 million of goodwill and $1 million of property and equipment. These charges were directly related to the Taxpayer Relief Act and the 2011 CMS Rules, which significantly reduced Medicare payments to our skilled nursing rehabilitation services operating segment and our nursing centers.\nFuture adverse changes in the operating environment and related key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets or a decline in the value of our Common Stock may result in future impairment charges for a portion or all of these assets. Moreover, the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets could be negatively impacted by potential healthcare reforms. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe could experience significant increases to our operating costs due to shortages of qualified nurses, therapists, home health and hospice employees and other healthcare professionals or union activity.\nThe market for qualified nurses, therapists, clinical associates, home health and hospice employees and other healthcare professionals is highly competitive. We, like other healthcare providers, have experienced difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel such as nurses, certified nurse\u2019s assistants, nurse\u2019s aides, therapists, home health and hospice employees and other providers of healthcare services. Our hospitals, nursing centers and home health and hospice operations are particularly dependent on nurses and other employees for patient care. Our rehabilitation division continues to seek qualified therapists to fill open positions. As the demand for home health services and hospice services continues to exceed the supply of available and qualified staff, home health operators and their competitors have been forced to offer more attractive wage and benefit packages to these professionals. The difficulty we have experienced in hiring and retaining qualified personnel has increased our average wage rates and may force us to increase our use of contract personnel.\nIn addition, healthcare providers are experiencing a high level of union activity across the country. At December 31, 2014, approximately 2,600 of the employees at 25 of our facilities were unionized. Though we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by future union activity, there are continuing legislative proposals that could result in increased union activity. We could experience an increase in labor and other costs from such union activity. Furthermore, we could experience a disruption of our operations if our employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage.\nWe expect to continue to experience increases in our labor costs primarily due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel. Salaries, wages and benefits were approximately 61% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our ability to manage labor costs will significantly affect our future operating results.\nDelays in collection of our accounts receivable could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nPrompt billing and collection are important factors in our liquidity. Billing and collection of our accounts receivable are subject to the complex regulations that govern Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and rules imposed by non-government payors. Our inability, or the inability of our customers, to bill and collect on a timely basis pursuant to these regulations and rules could subject us to payment delays that could negatively impact our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Further, the timing of payments made under the Medicare and Medicaid programs is subject to governmental budgetary constraints, resulting in an increased period of time between submission of claims and subsequent payment under specific programs, most notably under the Medicaid and Medicaid Managed programs, which typically pay claims approximately 60 to 90 days slower than the average TC hospital claim and approximately 15 days slower than the average nursing center claim. Reimbursement from the Medicaid and Medicaid Managed programs accounted for 12% and 2% of our revenues, respectively, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, we may experience delays in reimbursement as a result of the failure to receive prompt approvals related to change of ownership applications for acquired or other facilities or from delays caused by our or other third parties\u2019 information system failures. Significant delays in billing and/or collections may adversely affect the borrowing base under the ABL Facility, potentially limiting the availability of funds under the ABL Facility.\nAny acquisition, investment or strategic alliance that we have made or may make in the future may use significant resources, may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nWe intend to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions of, investments in, and strategic alliances with, hospitals, IRFs, nursing centers, rehabilitation operations, and home health and hospice operations, particularly where an acquisition may assist us in scaling our operations more rapidly and efficiently than internal growth. Acquisitions, including the Gentiva Merger and the Centerre Acquisition, may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, additional operating losses, amortization of certain intangible assets of acquired companies, dilutive issuances of equity securities and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nAcquisitions, investments and strategic alliances (including the Gentiva Merger and the Centerre Acquisition) involve numerous risks. These risks include:\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to identify acquisitions that meet our target criteria and complete such acquisitions on\nreasonable terms and valuations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to access equity or capital to fund acquisitions, including difficulty in obtaining financing\nfor acquisitions at a reasonable cost, or that such financing will contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating\nflexibility or ability to access additional capital when needed;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of substantial nonrecurring transaction costs, even if the transaction is not consummated, and additional\ndebt to finance such transaction;\n\u2022\nentry into markets or businesses in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\ndifficulty or inability to successfully integrate acquired operations, personnel and information systems, and in realizing\nprojected synergies and cost savings, particularly in the case of significant acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time from existing operations;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies;\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessment of assets and liabilities and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities of acquired\ncompanies, including liabilities for the failure to comply with healthcare laws;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we failed to discover liabilities of an acquired company during our due diligence investigation\nas part of any acquisition for which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible;\n\u2022\nobligations that we may have to joint venture partners and other counterparties of an acquired company that arise\nas a result of a change in control of an acquired company;\n\u2022\nobligations that we have to holders of our debt securities and to our lenders under our Credit Facilities,\nincluding our obligations to comply with financial covenants; and\n\u2022\nimpairment of acquired goodwill and intangible assets.\nIn addition to acquisitions, we also may pursue strategic opportunities involving the construction of new hospitals or nursing centers. The construction of new facilities involves numerous risks, including construction delays, cost over-runs, and the satisfaction of zoning and other regulatory requirements. We may be unable to operate newly constructed facilities profitably and such facilities may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, additional operating losses, and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur participation in partnerships may negatively impact our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nFollowing the Gentiva Merger and the Centerre Acquisition, we operate 23 of our facilities and 4 home health and hospice agencies through partnerships with unrelated parties. We are the majority owner of most of those partnerships. We may enter into additional partnerships with unrelated parties in the future to acquire, own or operate hospitals, IRFs, nursing centers and/or home health and hospice services. Although, we typically control the day-to-day activities of these partnerships, the partnerships agreements with our partners often include provisions reserving certain major actions for super-majority approval. Failure to obtain, or delays or substantial time and costs involved in obtaining, our partners\u2019 approval rights, if any, could adversely affect our ability to operate such partnerships, and could have a material adverse effect on such ventures or our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity more generally. Such actions may include entering into a new business activity or ceasing an existing activity, taking on substantial debt, admitting new partners, and terminating the venture. In addition, the partnership agreements may restrict our ability to derive cash from the partnerships and affect our ability to transfer our interest in the partnerships. We may be required to provide additional capital to a partnership if our partner defaults on its capital obligations. Our restrictions to derive cash, transfer our interests or provide additional funding to these partnerships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf we lose our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.\nOur future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to retain and motivate these individuals. Competition for these individuals is intense and there can be no assurance that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we can attract or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. If we lose the services of one or more of our key officers or employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to successfully manage our business, achieve our business objectives or replace them with similarly qualified personnel. If we lose key personnel, we may be unable to replace them with personnel of comparable experience, reputation in the industry or skills. The loss of any of our key officers or employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf we fail to attract patients and compete effectively with other healthcare providers or if our referral sources fail to view us as an attractive post-acute healthcare provider, our revenues and profitability may decline.\nThe post-acute healthcare services industry is highly competitive. Our hospitals face competition from healthcare providers that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals. Many competing hospitals are larger and more established than our hospitals. We may experience increased competition from existing hospitals, as well as hospitals converted, in whole or in part, to specialized care facilities. Our nursing centers compete on a local and regional basis with other nursing centers and post-acute\nhealthcare providers. Some of our competitors operate newer facilities and may offer services not provided by us or are operated by entities having greater financial and other resources than us. Our rehabilitation and care management divisions compete with national, regional and local rehabilitation, home health, hospice and community care service providers within our markets. Our rehabilitation and care management divisions further operate in industries with little or no barriers to entry in which other healthcare providers may elect to expand their services to include rehabilitation, home health, hospice care, community care or similar services. Several of these competitors may have greater financial and other resources than us, may be more established in the markets in which we compete and may be willing to provide services at lower prices. We cannot assure you that increased competition in the future will not adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, adult care centers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities where we provide services, as well as on our ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources. Our referral sources are not obligated to refer business to us and may refer business to other healthcare providers. We believe many of our referral sources refer patients and residents to us as a result of the quality of our patient services and our efforts to establish and build a relationship with them. If any of our facilities fail to achieve or maintain a reputation for providing high quality care, or are perceived to provide a lower quality of care than comparable facilities within the same geographic area, or customers of our rehabilitation therapy, home health or hospice services perceive that they could receive higher quality services from other providers, our ability to attract and retain patients and customers could be adversely affected. We believe that the perception of our quality of care by potential residents or patients or their families seeking our services is influenced by a variety of factors, including physician and other healthcare professional referrals, community information and referral services, newspapers and other print and electronic media, results of patient surveys, recommendations from family and friends, and published quality care statistics compiled by CMS or other industry data. If we lose, or fail to maintain, existing relationships with our referral resources, fail to develop new relationships or if we are perceived by our referral sources for any reason as not providing high quality patient care, our patient volumes and the quality of our patient mix could suffer and our revenue and profitability could decline.\nFailure to maintain the security and functionality of our information systems, or to defend a cyber security attack, could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operation and liquidity.\nWe are dependent on the proper function and availability of our information systems and related software programs. Though we have taken steps to protect the safety and security of our information systems and the patient health information and other data maintained within those systems, there can be no assurance that our safety and security measures and disaster recovery plan will prevent damage, interruption or breach of our information systems and operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees or contractors.\nAs a result of our acquisition activities, we have acquired additional information systems. We have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate, have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities, and are gradually migrating to fewer information systems. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences.\nIn addition, certain software supporting our business and information systems are licensed to us by third party software developers. Our inability, or the inability of these developers, to continue to maintain and upgrade our information systems and software could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems also could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.\nA cyber security attack or other incident that bypasses our information systems security could cause a security breach which may lead to a material disruption to our information systems infrastructure or business and may involve a significant loss of business or patient health information. If a cyber security attack or other unauthorized attempt to access our systems or facilities were to be successful, it could result in the theft, destructions, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential information or intellectual property, and could cause operational or business delays that may impact materially our ability to provide various healthcare services. Any successful cyber security attack or other unauthorized attempt to access our systems or facilities also could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation or brand with our patients, referral sources, payors or other third parties and could subject us to substantial penalties under HIPAA and other federal and state privacy laws, in addition to private litigation with those affected.\nFailure to maintain the security and functionality of our information systems and related software, or to defend a cyber security attack or other attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems, facilities or patient health information could expose us to a number of adverse consequences, the vast majority of which are not insurable, including but not limited to disruptions in our operations, regulatory and other civil and criminal penalties, fines, investigations and enforcement actions (including, but not limited to, those arising from the SEC, Federal Trade Commission, the OIG or state attorneys general), fines, private litigation with those affected by the data breach, loss of customers, disputes with payors and increased operating expense, which either individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nThere are risks of business disruption associated with new business systems and technology initiatives.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we implement new business and information technology systems for our various businesses. Implementation disruptions or the failure of new systems and technology initiatives to operate in accordance with expectations could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and operations with respect to our operations.\nEffective October 1, 2015, we, as well as all other entities covered by HIPAA, are required to report medical diagnoses under new ICD-10 coding diagnosis codes, which replace the current ICD-9 coding diagnosis codes. ICD-10 codes, which are alphanumeric and contain 3 to 7 characters, are entirely different from ICD-9 codes, which are mostly numeric and contain 3 to 5 digits. If claims are not reported properly under ICD-10, there can be a delay in the processing and payment of such claims, or a denial of such claims, which can have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have limited operational and strategic flexibility since we lease a substantial number of our facilities.\nWe lease a substantial number of our facilities from Ventas and other third parties. Under our leases, we generally are required to operate continuously our leased properties as a provider of healthcare services. In addition, these leases generally limit or restrict our ability to assign the lease to another party. Our failure to comply with these lease provisions would result in an event of default under the leases and subject us to material damages, including potential defaults under the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. Given these restrictions, we may be forced to continue operating unprofitable facilities to avoid defaults under our leases. For additional information on our Master Lease Agreements, see \u201cPart I - Item 1 - Business - Master Lease Agreements.\u201d\nPossible changes in the acuity of residents and patients, as well as payor mix and payment methodologies, may significantly affect our profitability.\nThe sources and amount of our revenues are determined by a number of factors, including the occupancy rates of our facilities, the length of stay, the payor mix of residents and patients, rates of reimbursement among payors and patient acuity. Changes in patient acuity as well as payor mix among private pay, Medicare and Medicaid may significantly affect our profitability. In particular, any significant decrease in our population of high acuity patients or any significant increase in our Medicaid population could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity, especially if state Medicaid programs continue to limit, or more aggressively seek limits on, reimbursement rates or service levels.\nWe may be unable to reduce costs to offset completely any decreases in our revenues.\nReduced levels of occupancy in our facilities and reductions in reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid or other payors would adversely impact our revenues and liquidity. We may be unable to put in place corresponding reductions in costs in response to declines in census or other revenue shortfalls. The inability to timely adjust our operations to address a decrease in our revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our payors and customers which in the future may cause us to make larger allowances for doubtful accounts or incur bad debt write-offs.\nDue to generally weak economic conditions, recent Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement reductions and other factors, commercial payors and customers may default on their payments to us and individual patients may default on co-payments and deductibles for which they are responsible under the terms of either commercial insurance programs or Medicare. Although we review the credit risk of our commercial payors and customers regularly, such risks may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to anticipate or control, such as a general economic downturn or changes in Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. If our payors or customers default on their payments to us in the future, we may have to record higher provisions for allowances for doubtful accounts or incur bad debt write-offs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nAn economic downturn, state budget pressures, sustained unemployment and continued deficit spending by the federal government may result in a reduction in reimbursement and covered services.\nAn economic downturn could have a detrimental effect on our revenues. Historically, state budget pressures have translated into reductions in state spending. Given that Medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets, we can expect continuing cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services in the states in which we operate. In addition, an economic downturn, coupled with sustained unemployment, may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs as well as the profitability of managed care companies, which could result in reduced reimbursement rates.\nThe existing federal deficit, as well as deficit spending by federal and state governments as the result of adverse developments in the economy or other reasons, can lead to continuing pressure to reduce governmental expenditures for other purposes, including government-funded programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Such actions in turn may adversely affect our results of operations.\nMany states have certificate of need laws or other regulatory provisions that may adversely impact our ability to expand into new markets and thereby limit our ability to grow and increase net patient service revenue.\nMany states have enacted certificate of need laws that require prior state approval to open new healthcare facilities or expand services at existing facilities. Those laws require some form of state agency review or approval before a healthcare provider may add new services or undertake significant capital expenditures. Our failure or inability to obtain any necessary approvals could adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our services and facilities in existing markets.\nTerrorist attacks, pandemics or natural disasters could negatively impact our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nTerrorist attacks, pandemics, or acts of nature, such as floods, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes or earthquakes, may cause damage or disruption to us, our employees and our facilities, which could have an adverse impact on our residents and patients. In order to provide care for our residents and patients, we are dependent upon consistent and reliable delivery of food, pharmaceuticals, power and other products to our facilities and the availability of employees to provide services at our facilities. If the delivery of goods or the ability of employees to reach our facilities were interrupted due to a natural disaster, pandemic or a terrorist attack, it could have a significant negative impact on our business. Furthermore, the impact, or impending threat, of a natural disaster has in the past and may in the future require that we evacuate one or more facilities, which would be costly and would involve substantial risks to our operations and potentially to our residents and patients. The impact of natural disasters, pandemics and terrorist attacks is inherently uncertain. Such events could severely damage or destroy one or more of our facilities, harm our business, reputation and financial performance or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nClimate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nClimate change could have a potential economic impact on us and climate change mitigation programs and regulations could increase our costs. Energy costs could be higher as a result of climate change regulations. Our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs, such as those associated with carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. In addition, climate change may increase the frequency or intensity of natural disasters. As such, we cannot assure you that climate change will not adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe inability or failure of management in the future to conclude that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or the inability of our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report of our internal control over financial reporting, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm also must audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. If we fail to have, or management or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to conclude that we maintain, effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, we could be unable to provide timely and reliable financial information as required by the federal securities laws which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Different interpretations of accounting principles or changes in generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles are complex, continually evolving and changing and may be subject to varied interpretation by third parties, including the SEC. Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. Differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles or changes in generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nDuring 2014, Gentiva concluded that effective controls were not maintained over its accounting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Specifically, Gentiva\u2019s controls were not effectively designed and did not operate at the appropriate level of precision to ensure completeness and accuracy of assumptions used in its valuation models for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible\nassets and to reassess the lives of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to closed or consolidated branches. These control deficiencies resulted in Gentiva\u2019s restatement of its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the quarter ended March 31, 2014 and the revision of its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the quarters ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2013. Gentiva\u2019s management concluded that these control deficiencies constituted a material weakness. If we are unable to effectively remediate this material weakness or are otherwise unable to maintain adequate internal controls over Gentiva\u2019s financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to prepare reliable financial statements and comply with our reporting obligations on a timely basis, which could materially adversely affect our business and subject us to legal and regulatory action.", "PERMNO": 89207, "SIC": 8051, "TIC": "KND"}
