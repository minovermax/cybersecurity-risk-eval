Risk Factors\nThis Form 10-K, including Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d Item 2, \u201cProperties,\u201d Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\u201d contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws, as described under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d above.\nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed in those Items and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and risks and uncertainties that apply to businesses or public companies generally, the following important risk factors which are particularly applicable to our business could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements, or could otherwise materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition:\nCOVID-19 Related Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its widespread effects on the United States and global economies may have a material adverse effect on our business which could continue for an unknown period of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased our economic, demand and operational uncertainty. The rapid worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus, as well as the measures governments and private organizations have implemented in order to stem the spread of this pandemic, is resulting in significant worldwide disruptions and contractions in economic activity, including those resulting from \u201cshelter in place\u201d and similar orders, restrictions on non-essential business operations and travel, and increased unemployment. We have global operations, customers and suppliers, including in countries most impacted by COVID-19, and both the disease itself and the actions taken around the world to slow the spread of COVID-19 have impacted our customers and suppliers; and future developments could cause further disruptions to the Company due to the interconnected nature of our business relationships.\nWe have been and may continue to be subject to postponement or cancellation of certain contracts to which we are a party. We have also suffered a significant reduction in our commercial aircraft business due to slowdowns in OEM production and reduced flights, and this business is unlikely to return to pre-COVID levels for an unknown but possibly significant period of time. Current restrictions and conditions have and may continue to prevent or delay us in accessing customer facilities to deliver products and provide services, and disrupt or delay our supply chain. Even though our businesses have been classified as essential businesses and allowed to remain in operation in jurisdictions in which facility closures have been mandated, we can give no assurance that this will not change in the future or that our businesses will be classified as essential in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Further, although we have implemented prevention measures at our own facilities, including enhanced cleaning procedures, social distancing efforts and working from home where feasible, and substantially all of our facilities have so far remained in business, we have occasionally incurred short-term disruptions in some facility operations, and due to the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic there can be no assurance that we will not suffer facility closures or other adverse effects on our business operations in the future.\nThe facilities of our suppliers and customers have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in manufacturing and supply arrangements due to the loss or disruption of critical manufacturing and supply elements, such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, workforce or other manufacturing and distribution capability. We may also experience failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, distributors and contractors, to meet their obligations to us, or significant restrictions in their ability to do so. In addition, our compliance with applicable safety requirements may cause us to lose critical employees who are unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements.\nThese facts and circumstances may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in the future, and the length of time these impacts may continue, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain its impact.\nRisks Related to our Governmental and Aerospace Business\nOur sales of products to the Government depend upon continued Government funding.\nSales to the U.S. Government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. Over the past three fiscal years, from 21% to 28% of our revenues have been generated from sales to the U.S. Government or its contractors, primarily within our A&D segment. These sales are dependent on government funding of the underlying programs, which is generally subject to annual Congressional appropriations. There could be reductions or terminations of, or delays in, the government funding on programs which apply to us or our customers. These funding effects could adversely affect our sales and profit, and could bring about a restructuring of our operations, which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. A significant portion of VACCO\u2019s, Westland\u2019s and Globe\u2019s sales involve major U.S. Government programs such as NASA\u2019s Space Launch System (SLS) and U.S. Navy submarines. A reduction or delay in Government spending on these programs could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results which could extend for more than a single year.\nOur Government business increases the risk that we may not realize the full amount of our backlog.\nAs of September 30, 2021, our twelve-month backlog was approximately $441 million, which represents confirmed orders we believe will be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months. There can be no assurance that our customers will purchase all the orders represented in our backlog, particularly as to contracts which are subject to the U.S. Government\u2019s and its subcontractors\u2019 ability to modify or terminate major programs or contracts, and if and to the extent that this occurs, our future revenues could be materially reduced.\nThe end of customer product life cycles could negatively affect our A&D segment\u2019s results.\nMany of our A&D segment products are sold to be components in our customers\u2019 end-products. If a customer discontinues a certain end-product line, our ability to continue to sell those components will be reduced or eliminated. The result could be a significant decrease in our sales. For example, a substantial portion of PTI\u2019s revenue is generated from commercial aviation aftermarket sales. As certain aircraft are retired and replaced by newer aircraft, there could be a corresponding decrease in sales associated with our current products. Such a decrease could adversely affect our operating results.\nRisks Related to our International Business\nNegative worldwide economic conditions and related credit shortages could result in a decrease in our sales and an increase in our operating costs, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf there is a worsening of global and U.S. economic and financial market conditions and additional tightening of global credit markets, many of our customers may further delay or reduce their purchases of our products. Uncertainties in the global economy may cause the utility industry and commercial market customers to experience shortages in available credit, which could limit capital spending. To the extent this problem affects our customers, our sales and profits could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit, they may have to increase their prices or become unable to continue to offer the products and services we use to manufacture our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in tariffs or other changes in trade policies could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nIn addition to the effects of increases in market prices, increases in domestic import tariffs could increase the prices to us of our foreign-sourced raw materials and product components and thereby require us to either increase our selling prices or accept reduced margins. In the case of ETS-Lindgren, for example, tariffs on imports of Chinese goods have raised the costs of components purchased by it either from its China facility or from other Chinese suppliers, and its margins in China have been impacted by the increased costs of its products made in the U.S. and sold through its Chinese business.\nIn addition, increases in foreign-country tariffs applicable to our exported products could increase the effective prices of our products to our customers in those countries unless we are able to offset the tariffs by reducing our selling prices. Any or all of these factors could decrease the demand for our products, reduce our profitability, and/or make our products less competitive than those of other manufacturers that are not subject to the same tariffs. For example, since 2019 increased tariffs imposed by China on U.S. origin goods have adversely affected sales of NRG\u2019s products in China by increasing their prices to Chinese customers.\nIn addition, trade restrictions against certain foreign-made products or entities may adversely affect our business and our ability to compete in certain markets. Our business may also be impacted by the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China which are causing U.S. goods to be viewed in a less favorable light by Chinese customers.\nOur international operations expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries, and our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers. Our financial results may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars, and we may not be able to adequately or successfully hedge against these risks. In addition, a rise in the dollar against foreign currencies could make our products more expensive for foreign customers and cause them to reduce the volume of their purchases.\nEconomic, political and other risks of our international operations, including terrorist activities, could adversely affect our business.\nIn 2021, approximately 28% of our net sales were to customers outside the United States. Increases in international tariffs resulting from changes in domestic or foreign trade policies could increase the costs of the raw materials used in our products and/or the costs of our products. In addition, an economic downturn or an adverse change in the political situation in certain foreign countries in which we do business could cause a decline in revenues and adversely affect our financial condition. For example, our Test segment does significant business in Asia, and changes in the Asian political climate or political changes in specific Asian countries could negatively affect our business; several of our subsidiaries are based in Europe and could be negatively impacted by weakness in the European economy; and Doble\u2019s future business in the Middle East could be adversely affected by continuing political unrest, wars and terrorism in the region.\nOur international sales are also subject to other risks inherent in foreign commerce, including currency fluctuations and devaluations, differences in foreign laws, uncertainties as to enforcement of contract or intellectual property rights, and difficulties in negotiating and resolving disputes with our foreign customers.\nOur governmental sales and our international and export operations are subject to special U.S. and foreign government laws and regulations which may impose significant compliance costs, create reputational and legal risk, and impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nThe international scope of our operations subjects us to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world, and our foreign operations are governed by laws and business practices that often differ from those of the U.S. In addition, laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries increase the need for us to manage the risks of improper conduct not only by our own employees but by distributors and contractors who may not be within our direct control. Many of our exports are of products which are subject to U.S. Government regulations and controls such as the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which impose certain restrictions on the U.S. export of defense articles and services, and these restrictions are subject to change from time to time, including changes in the countries into which our products may lawfully be sold.\nIf we were to fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties and other sanctions including the inability to continue to export our products or to sell our products to the U.S. Government or to certain other customers. In addition, some of these regulations may be viewed as too restrictive by our international customers, who may elect to develop their own domestic products or procure products from other international suppliers which are not subject to comparable export restrictions; and the laws, regulations or policies of certain other countries may also favor their own domestic suppliers over foreign suppliers such as the Company.\nRisks Related to our Manufacturing and Sales Operations and Technology\nDisruptions of Our Information Technology Systems, or Information Security and/or Data Privacy Breaches, Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nWe have many information technology systems that are important to the operation of our businesses, some of which are managed by third parties. These systems are used to obtain, process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of\nintegral business processes and activities. Our primary and backup computer systems are vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components and from power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, security breaches, natural disasters and errors by employees. Any failure in the operation of our information technology systems could adversely affect our businesses or operating results. Although losses arising from some of these issues may be covered by information security insurance, we cannot guarantee that our coverage will be adequate for all costs or losses incurred.\nGlobal information technology security threats and targeted computer crime are increasing in frequency and sophistication and pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. We attempt to mitigate these risks through numerous measures, including employee training and testing, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Although we do not believe we have experienced a material information security breach in the last three years, and we have incurred no fines, settlement costs or other material expenses related to information security breaches, if we were to experience such a breach it could adversely affect our reputation and result in litigation, regulatory action, liability for fines, penalties and related expenses, and costs of implementing additional data protection procedures. In addition, even though we generally do not conduct business directly with retail or individual customers or consumers we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S. and elsewhere. Compliance with data privacy laws and regulations increases operational complexity, and failure to comply with legal or regulatory standards could subject us to fines and penalties, as well as legal and reputational risks, including proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. Although we maintain insurance coverage for data privacy risks, we cannot guarantee that our coverage will be adequate for all costs or losses incurred.\nA significant part of our manufacturing operations depends on a small number of third-party suppliers.\nA significant part of our manufacturing operations relies on a small number of third-party manufacturers to supply component parts or products. For example, Doble has arrangements with six manufacturers which produce and supply a substantial portion of its end-products, and one of these suppliers produces approximately 35% of Doble\u2019s products from a single location within the United States. As another example, PTI has a single supplier of critical electronic components for a significant aircraft production program, and if this supplier were to discontinue producing these components the need to secure another source could pose a risk to the production program. A significant disruption in the supply of those products or others provided by a small number of suppliers could negatively affect the timely delivery of products to customers as well as future sales, which could increase costs and reduce margins.\nCertain of our other businesses are dependent upon sole source or a limited number of third-party manufacturers of parts and components. Many of these suppliers are small businesses. Since alternative supply sources are limited, there is an increased risk of adverse impacts on our production schedules and profits if our suppliers were to default in fulfilling their price, quality or delivery obligations. In addition, some of our customers or potential customers may prefer to purchase from a supplier which does not have such a limited number of sources of supply.\nIncreases in prices of raw material and components, and decreased availability of such items, could adversely affect our business.\nThe cost of raw materials and product components is a major element of the total cost of many of our products. For example, our Test segment\u2019s critical components rely on purchases of raw materials from third parties. Increases in the prices of raw materials (such as steel, copper, nickel, zinc, wood and petrochemical products) could have an adverse impact on our business by, among other things, increasing costs and reducing margins. Aerospace-grade titanium and gaseous helium, important raw materials for our A&D segment, may at times be in short supply; in addition, although we try to tie our supplier pricing to long-term contracts this is not always possible, and we are experiencing price inflation on a number of products. Further, some of Doble\u2019s items of equipment which are provided to its customers for their use are in the maturity of their life cycles, which creates the risk that replacement components may be unavailable or available only at increased costs. Doble has experienced COVID-related short term disruptions in the supply chain which have periodically resulted in extended lead times and cost increases, and the long term impacts of these disruptions are uncertain. See also \u201cCOVID-19 Related Risks\u201d above.\nIn addition, our reliance on sole or limited sources of supply of raw materials and components in each of our segments could adversely affect our business, as described in the preceding Risk Factor. The potential physical impacts of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt our supply chain, and cause our suppliers to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these effects. These and other weather-created disruptions in supply, in addition to affecting costs, could impact our ability to procure an adequate supply of these raw materials and components, and delay or prevent deliveries of products to our customers. The entire electronics industry is currently disrupted due to limited sources of supply, and we\nare subject to the same supply chain risks as other manufacturers of products containing electronic components. See also \u201cCOVID-19 Related Risks\u201d above.\nOur inability to timely develop new products could reduce our future sales.\nMuch of our business is dependent on the continuous development of new products and technologies to meet the changing needs of our markets on a cost-effective basis. Many of these markets are highly technical from an engineering standpoint, and the relevant technologies are subject to rapid change. If we fail to timely enhance existing products or develop new products as needed to meet market or competitive demands, we could lose sales opportunities, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, in some existing contracts with customers, we have made commitments to develop and deliver new products. If we fail to meet these commitments, the default could result in the imposition on us of contractual penalties including termination. Our inability to enhance existing products in a timely manner could make our products less competitive, while our inability to successfully develop new products may limit our growth opportunities. Development of new products and product enhancements may also require us to make greater investments in research and development than we now do, and the increased costs associated with new product development and product enhancements could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our costs of new product development may not be recoverable if demand for our products is not as great as we anticipate it to be.\nProduct defects or customer claims could result in costly fixes, litigation and damages.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products of third-party vendors which we use or resell, many of which are mission-critical to our customers. If there are claims related to defective products (under warranty or otherwise), particularly in a product recall situation, we could be faced with significant expenses in replacing or repairing the product. For example, the A&D segment obtains raw materials, machined parts and other product components from suppliers who provide certifications of quality which we rely on. Should these product components be defective and pass undetected into finished products, or should a finished product contain a defect, we could incur significant costs for repairs, re-work and/or removal and replacement of the defective product. In addition, if a dispute over product claims cannot be settled, arbitration or litigation may result, requiring us to incur attorneys\u2019 fees and exposing us to the potential of damage awards against us.\nA major portion of our Test segment\u2019s business involves working in conjunction with general contractors to produce complex building components constructed on-site, such as electronic test chambers, secure communication rooms and MRI facilities. If there are performance problems caused by either us or a contractor, they could result in cost overruns and may lead to a dispute as to which party is responsible. The resolution of such disputes can involve arbitration or litigation, and can cause us to incur significant expense including attorneys\u2019 fees. In addition, these disputes could result in a reduction in revenue, a loss on a particular project, or even a significant damages award against us.\nDespite our efforts, we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property.\nMuch of our business success depends on our ability to protect and freely utilize our various intellectual properties, including both patents and trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products and technology, particularly in foreign countries such as China where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Our current and future actions to enforce our proprietary rights may ultimately not be successful; or in some cases we may not elect to pursue an unauthorized user due to the high costs and uncertainties associated with litigation. We may also face exposure to claims by others challenging our intellectual property rights. Any or all of these actions may divert our resources and cause us to incur substantial costs.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations or environmental contamination could increase our expenses and adversely affect our profitability.\nOur operations and properties are subject to U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, emission, discharge, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and the clean-up of contaminated properties. In addition, governments around the world are increasingly focused on enacting laws and regulations regarding climate change and regulation of greenhouse gases. These regulations, and changes to them, could increase our cost of compliance, and our failure to comply could result in the imposition of significant fines, suspension of production, alteration of\nproduct processes, cessation of operations or other actions which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently involved as a responsible party in several ongoing investigations and remediations of contaminated third-party owned properties. In addition, environmental contamination may be discovered in the future on properties which we formerly owned or operated and for which we could be legally responsible. Future costs associated with these situations, including ones which may be currently unknown to us, are difficult to quantify but could have a significant effect on our financial condition. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters\u201d for a discussion of these factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy and Corporate Structure\nChanges in testing standards could adversely impact our Test and USG segments\u2019 sales.\nA significant portion of the business of our USG and Test segments involves sales to technology customers who need to have a third party verify that their products meet specific international and domestic test standards. If regulatory agencies were to eliminate or reduce certain domestic or international test standards, or if demand for product testing from these customers were to decrease for some other reason, our sales could be adversely affected. For example, if a regulatory authority were to relax the test standards for certain electronic devices because they were determined not to interfere with the broadcast spectrum, or if new wireless communication technologies were developed that required less testing or different types of testing, our sales of certain testing products could be significantly reduced.\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions successfully, which may inhibit our rate of growth.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we plan to continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies, assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business. However, we may be unable to implement this strategy if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms. We expect to face competition for acquisition candidates which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may result in higher acquisition prices. As a result, we may be limited in the number of acquisitions which we are able to complete and we may face difficulties in achieving the profitability or cash flows needed to justify our investment in them.\nOur acquisitions of other companies carry risk.\nAcquisitions of other companies involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies, the potential exposure to unanticipated and undisclosed liabilities, the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase, the potential loss of key personnel, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses and the diversion of Management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns. Although we attempt to identify and evaluate the risks inherent in any acquisition, we may not properly ascertain or mitigate all such risks, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may incur significant costs, experience short-term inefficiencies, or be unable to realize expected long-term savings from facility consolidations and other business reorganizations.\nWe periodically assess the cost and operational structure of our facilities in order to manufacture and sell our products in the most efficient manner, and based on these assessments, we may from time to time reorganize, relocate or consolidate certain of our facilities. These actions may require us to incur significant costs and may result in short term business inefficiencies as we consolidate and close facilities and transition our employees; and in addition, we may not achieve the expected long-term benefits. Any or all of these factors could result in an adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur inability to hire or retain qualified key employees could affect our performance and revenues.\nThere is a risk of our losing key employees having engineering and technical expertise. For example, our USG segment relies heavily on engineers with significant experience and reputation in the utility industry to furnish expert consulting services and support to customers, and our other segments similarly rely on qualified and experienced employees to carry on their businesses. Despite our active recruitment efforts, there remains a shortage of these qualified engineers and other employees because of hiring competition\nfrom other companies in the industry and a generally tight labor market, possibly exacerbated by COVID-related retirements or career changes. Losing current employees or qualified candidates to other employers or for other reasons could reduce our ability to provide services and negatively affect our revenues.\nOur decentralized organizational structure presents certain risks.\nWe are a relatively decentralized company in comparison with some of our peers. This decentralization necessarily places significant control and decision-making powers in the hands of local management, which present various risks, including the risk that we may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting a key business than we would in a more centralized management environment. We may also be slower to detect or react to compliance related problems (such as an employee undertaking activities prohibited by applicable law or by our internal policies), and Company-wide business initiatives may be more challenging and costly to implement, and the risks of noncompliance or failures higher, than they would be under a more centralized management structure. Depending on the nature of the problem or initiative in question, such noncompliance or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or result of operations.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Missouri law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and could discourage acquisition bids or a change of control, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions which could discourage potential hostile takeover attempts, including: a limitation on the shareholders\u2019 ability to call special meetings of shareholders; advance notice requirements to nominate candidates for election as directors or to propose matters for action at a meeting of shareholders; a classified board of directors, which means that approximately one-third of our directors are elected each year; and the authority of our board of directors to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the board may determine. In addition, the laws of Missouri, in which we are incorporated, require a two-thirds vote of outstanding shares to approve mergers or certain other major corporate transactions, rather than a simple majority as in some other states such as Delaware. These provisions could impede a merger or other change of control not approved by our board of directors, which could discourage takeover attempts and in some circumstances reduce the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 76478, "SIC": 3825, "TIC": "ESE"}
