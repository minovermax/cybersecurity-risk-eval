Risk Factors\nReaders should carefully consider, in connection with other information disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the risks and uncertainties described below. The following discussion sets forth risks that we believe are material to our stockholders and prospective stockholders. The occurrence of any of the following risks might cause our stockholders to lose all or a part of their investment in our Company. We cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this document are a complete set of all potential risks we may face; additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not believed by us to be material may also affect our business results, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. Some statements in this report, including statements in the following risk factors section, constitute forward-looking statements. Please also refer to the section titled \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from Popular.\nOur services to Popular account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we expect that our services to Popular will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. In 2019, products and services billed to Popular accounted for approximately 43% of our total revenues. The majority of Popular\u2019s business is presented in the Business Solutions segment. If Popular were to terminate, fail to perform under (in whole or in part), or fail to renew the Master Services Agreement (\u201cMSA\u201d), which currently expires in 2025, or our other material agreements with Popular, our revenues could be materially reduced and our profitability and cash flows could also be materially reduced, all of which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend, in part, on our merchant relationships and our alliance with Banco Popular, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Popular, to grow our merchant acquiring business. If we are unable to maintain these relationships and this alliance, our business may be adversely affected.\nGrowth in our merchant acquiring business is derived primarily from acquiring new merchant relationships, new and enhanced product and service offerings, cross selling products and services into existing relationships, the shift of consumer spending to increased usage of electronic forms of payment, and the strength of our relationship with Banco Popular. A substantial portion of our business is generated from our Independent Sales Organization Sponsorship and Services Agreement (the \u201cISO Agreement\u201d) with Banco Popular, which expires in 2025.\nBanco Popular acts as a merchant referral source and provides sponsorship into the ATH, Visa, Discover and MasterCard networks for merchants, as well as card association sponsorship, clearing and settlement services. We provide transaction processing and related functions. Both we and Popular as alliance partners may provide management, sales, marketing, and other administrative services to merchants. We rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships, which in turn is dependent upon our alliance with Banco Popular and other distribution channels. There can be no guarantee that this growth will continue and the loss or deterioration of these relationships, whether due to the termination of the ISO Agreement or otherwise, could negatively impact our business and result in a reduction of our revenue and income.\nOur MSA with Popular, our ISO Agreement with Banco Popular and our ATH Network Participation Agreement and ATH Support Agreement with Banco Popular (the \u201cBPPR ATH Agreements\u201d) have initial terms ending in 2025. If Popular or Banco Popular decide not to renew one or more of these agreements, or if we are unable to negotiate extensions, or if we must provide significant concessions to Popular or Banco Popular to secure extensions or otherwise, our results of operations, financial condition and trading price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected, and it could also potentially limit our ability to renegotiate our debt.\nOur MSA with Popular has an initial term that ends in 2025. For 2019, we derived approximately 43% of our revenue from such contract, which makes the MSA our most significant client contract. We regularly discuss with Popular the terms of the MSA and the services we provide thereunder to Popular. We cannot be certain that we will be able to negotiate an extension to the MSA. In addition, even if we are able to negotiate an extension of the MSA, any new master services agreement may be materially different from the existing MSA. Further, Popular may require significant concessions from us with respect to pricing, services and other key terms, both in respect of the current term and any extension of the MSA, particularly as we approach 2025. Any such events may materially negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and trading price of our common stock, as well as potentially limit our ability to renegotiate our debt.\nPursuant to our ISO Agreement with Banco Popular, Banco Popular sponsors us as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card associations and is required to exclusively refer to us any merchant that inquires about, requests or otherwise evidences interest in merchant and other services. If the ISO Agreement is not renewed, we will have to seek other card association sponsors, we will not benefit from Banco Popular referral of merchants and we may experience the loss of some merchants if Banco Popular itself enters the merchant acquiring business or agrees to sponsor another independent sales organization. Any of these may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, the BPPR ATH Agreements have initial terms ending in 2025. Under such agreements, among other things, we provide Banco Popular certain ATM and POS services in connection with our ATH network; we grant a license to use the ATH logo, word mark and associated trademarks; and Banco Popular agrees to support, promote and market the ATH network and brand and to issue debit cards bearing the symbol of the ATH network. If one or both of the BPPR ATH Agreements are not extended, our ATH brand and network could be negatively impacted and our financial condition and results of operations adversely affected.\nA protracted government shutdown could negatively affect our financial condition.\nDuring any protracted federal government shutdown, the federal government may reduce or cut funding for certain welfare and disaster relief programs. Beneficiaries of certain federal programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), obtain their benefits through electronic benefits transfer (EBT) accounts. A temporary or permanent reduction in federal welfare and relief programs could lead to a decrease in electronic benefit card volume. The effect of a protracted government shutdown now or in the future may affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to renew client contracts on favorable terms or at all, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nFailure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business. Our contracts with private clients generally run for a period of one to five years, except for our Master Services Agreement with Popular. Our government contracts generally run for one year and do not include automatic renewal periods due to government procurement rules and related fiscal funding requirements. Our standard merchant contract has an initial term of up to three years, with automatic one-year renewal periods. At the end of the contract term, clients can renew or renegotiate their contracts with us, but may also consider whether to engage one of our competitors to provide products and services. If we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and/or contract terms that are favorable to us, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our notes and senior secured credit facilities, and, if we incur additional amounts of debt, it could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2019, the total principal amount of our indebtedness was approximately $530.9 million. Our high degree of leverage could have a significant impact on us, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes, including for our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increases in interest rates because our borrowings are predominantly at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness generally, including complying with restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, our noncompliance with which could result in an event of default under the agreements setting forth the terms such of other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors who may be less highly leveraged and who therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nWe rely on our systems, employees and certain suppliers and counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations.\nMany of our services are based on sophisticated software, technology and computing systems, and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services. Further, the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained, and may in the future contain, undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition, we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our customers.\nOur businesses are dependent on our ability to reliably process, record and monitor a large number of transactions. For example, we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions, other businesses and consumers and process funds transactions from clients, card issuers, payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types. Transactions facilitated by us include debit card, credit card, electronic bill payment transactions, ACH payments, electronic benefits transfer transactions and check clearing that supports consumers, financial institutions and other businesses. These payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties, the facilitation of the payment and, in some cases, the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments. If any of our financial, accounting, or other data processing systems or applications fail or experience other significant shortcomings or limitations, our ability to serve our clients and accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such failures or shortcomings could be the result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses, fires, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, disease pandemics, terrorist acts or other unanticipated damage to property or physical assets. Any such failure or shortcoming could also damage our reputation, require us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, and may result in liability to third parties, especially since some of our contractual agreements with financial institutions require the crediting of certain fees if our systems do not meet certain specified service levels.\nAlthough we have taken steps to protect against data loss and system failures, there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience system failures. We perform the vast majority of disaster recovery operations ourselves, though we utilize select third parties for some aspects of recovery. To the extent we outsource our disaster recovery, we are at risk of the vendor\u2019s unresponsiveness in the event of breakdowns in our systems. Furthermore, our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur.\nWe are similarly dependent on our employees. Our operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more employees cause a significant operational breakdown or failure, either intentionally or as a result of human error. Suppliers and third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us, including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties\u2019 own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention or fines, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China and resulted in an outbreak with infections throughout China and abroad, which has affected operations and global supply chains. During the first months of 2020, we were notified of potential delays in the delivery of POS devices from suppliers whose operations have been affected by the coronavirus. At this time, the coronavirus has not caused major disruptions to our operations, nor has it affected our employees or client base. However, if the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread and becomes a global pandemic, it may affect our employees, our clients and our suppliers in ways which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nLaws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against us.\nOur business relies on the processing of data in multiple jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continues to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may differ from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our ongoing efforts to comply with privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection laws may entail expenses, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer. Enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy actions or investigations could damage our reputation and impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.\nIf our amortizable intangible assets or goodwill become impaired, it may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIf our amortizable intangible assets or goodwill were to become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), definitive useful life intangibles are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. The goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded.\nOur risk management procedures may not be fully effective in identifying or helping us mitigate our risk exposure against all types of risks.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing industry, and we have experienced significant change in the past ten years, including our separation from Popular following the Merger, our initial public offering in April 2013 and our listing on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). Accordingly, we may not be fully effective in identifying, monitoring and managing our risks. In some cases, the information we use to perform our risk assessments may not be accurate, complete or up-to-date. In other cases, our risk assessments may depend upon information that we may not have or cannot obtain. If we are not fully effective or we are not always successful in identifying all risks to which we are or may be exposed, we could be subject to losses, penalties, litigation or regulatory actions that could harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe are subject to security breaches or other confidential data theft from our systems, which can adversely affect our reputation and business.\nAs part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data, such as names and addresses, social security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, cardholder data and payment history records. We also operate payment, cash access and electronic card systems. Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, a trend we expect will continue. The objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupt operations, cause denial of service events, corrupt data, and steal non-public information. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities.\nDespite the safeguards we have in place, unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information, the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in the successful operations of our businesses. These risks are increased when we transmit information over the Internet as our visibility in the global payments industry may attract hackers to conduct attacks on our systems. Our security measures may also be breached due to the mishandling or misuse of information; for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by employees acting contrary to our policies or as a result of a fault in our systems.\nActual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches may lead to claims against us, which may require us to spend significant additional resources to remediate by addressing problems caused by breaches and further protect against security or privacy breaches. Additionally, while we maintain insurance policies specifically for cyber-attacks, our current insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies. A significant security breach, such as loss of credit card numbers and related information, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and could result in a loss of customers throughout the years. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results or reputation, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. We cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent them will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. In addition, any breaches of network or data security at our customers, partners or vendors could have similar negative effects.\nThe ability to adopt technology to changing industry and customer needs or trends may affect our competitiveness or demand for our products, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our services. Our businesses operate in industries that are subject to technological advancements, developing industry standards and changing customer needs and preferences. Also, our customers continue to adopt new technology for business and personal uses. We must anticipate and respond to these industry and customer changes in order to remain competitive within our relative markets. Our inability to respond to new competitors and technological advancements could impact all of our businesses. For example, the ability to adopt technological advancements surrounding POS technology available to merchants could have an impact on our merchant acquiring business.\nConsolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients.\nIn recent years, there have been a number of mergers and consolidations in the banking and financial services industry. Mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients, which could adversely affect our revenues. Further, if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. It is also possible that the larger banks or financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations would have greater leverage to negotiate terms less favorable to us or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the credit risk that our merchants will be unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our merchants being unable to satisfy obligations for which we also may be liable. For example, as the merchant acquirer, we are contingently liable for transactions originally acquired by us that are disputed by the cardholder and charged back to the merchants. For certain merchants, if we are unable to collect amounts paid to cardholders in the form of refunds or chargebacks from the merchant, we bear the loss for those amounts. Notwithstanding our adherence to\nindustry standards with regards to the acceptance of new merchants and certain steps to screen for merchant credit risk, a default on payment obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on our payment processing clients to comply with their contractual obligations, as well as any applicable laws, regulatory requirements and credit card associations rules or standards.\nOur contracts with our payment processing clients generally require that they comply with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements, as well as any applicable credit card associations rules or standards. A client\u2019s failure to comply with any such laws or requirements could force us to declare a breach of contract and terminate the client relationship. The termination of such contracts or relationships, as well as any inability to collect any damages caused, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any such failure by clients to comply could also result in fines, penalties or obligations imputed to EVERTEC, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIncreased competition could adversely affect our business.\nA decline in the market for our services as a result of increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and existing competitors expand their services. Some of these competitors could have greater overall financial, technical and marketing resources than us, which could enhance their ability to finance acquisitions, fund internal growth and respond more quickly to professional and technological changes. Some competitors could have or may develop a lower cost structure. New competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge, resulting in a loss of business for us and a corresponding decline in revenues and profit margin.\nChanges in consumer spending or payment preferences could adversely affect our business.\nA decline in the market for our services, either as a result of continued migration of Puerto Ricans to the U.S. mainland, a further deterioration in the Puerto Rico economy, a decrease in consumer spending or a shift in consumer payment preferences, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If consumer confidence decreases in a way that adversely affects consumer spending, whether in conjunction with a global economic downturn or otherwise, we could experience a reduction in the volume of transactions we process. In addition, if we fail to respond to changes in technology or consumer payment preferences, we could lose business.\nThere may be a change in the use of cards as a payment mechanism or adverse developments with respect to card industry in general.\nIf the number of electronic and digital payment transactions of the type we process does not continue to grow or if businesses or consumers do not continue to adopt our services, it could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our business, financial position and results of operations. We believe future growth in the use of credit, debit and other electronic and digital payments will be driven by the cost, ease-to-use, and quality of products and services offered to customers and businesses. In order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability, businesses and consumers must continue to use electronic and digital payment methods that we process, including credit and debit cards.\nChanges in credit card association or other network rules or standards could adversely affect our business.\nIn order to provide our transaction processing services, several of our subsidiaries are registered with or certified by Visa, Discover and MasterCard and other networks as members or as service providers for member institutions. As such, we and many of our customers are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us or our customers to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for certain acts or omissions by us, acquirer customers, processing customers and merchants. Visa, Discover, MasterCard and other networks, some of which are our competitors, set the standards with which we must comply. The termination of Banco Popular\u2019s or our subsidiaries\u2019 member registration or our subsidiaries\u2019 status as a certified service provider, or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards, that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to or through our customers, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in interchange fees or other fees charged by card associations and debit networks could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, card associations and debit networks change interchange, processing and other fees, which could impact our merchant acquiring and payment services businesses. Competitive pressures could result in our merchant acquiring and payment services businesses absorbing a portion of such increases in the future, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the \u201cBHC Act\u201d), to the extent that we are deemed to be controlled by Popular, we will be subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, and our activities will be limited to those permissible under the BHC Act and related regulations. We may be required to obtain regulatory approval before engaging in certain new activities or businesses, whether organically or by acquisition.\nTo the extent that we are deemed to be controlled by Popular pursuant to regulation and guidance under the BHC Act, we will be subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. The BHC Act defines \u201ccontrol\u201d differently than GAAP, and \u201ccontrol\u201d can be found based on a variety of facts and circumstances.\nNew lines of business, other new activities and acquisitions that we may wish to commence or undertake in the future, including the manner in which we conduct our business or may undertake such activities or acquisitions, may not be permissible for us under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation K or other applicable U.S. federal banking laws or may require the approval of the Federal Reserve Board or another applicable U.S. federal banking regulator. In addition, potential acquisitions may take longer, be more costly, or make us less attractive as a buyer. There can be no assurance that any required regulatory approvals will be obtained, or that they will be obtained without regulatory conditions. Additional regulatory requirements may be imposed on our activities or acquisitions to the extent we are controlled by Popular and Popular is subject to any supervisory or enforcement action, even if the supervisory actions are unrelated to us or to our business.\nAs a technology service provider to regulated financial institutions, we are subject to additional regulatory oversight and examination.\nIn general, financial institution regulators require their supervised institutions to cause their service providers to agree to certain terms and to agree to supervision and oversight by applicable financial regulators, primarily to protect the safety and soundness of the financial institution. We have agreed to such terms and provisions in many of our service agreements with financial institutions. In particular, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by applicable U.S. federal regulators as a technology service provider to regulated U.S. financial institutions, including Banco Popular.\nChanges in laws, regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect the products and services we provide and markets in which we operate.\nWe and our customers are subject to U.S. federal, Puerto Rico and other countries\u2019 laws, rules and regulations that affect the electronic payments industry. Our customers are subject to numerous laws, rules and regulations applicable to banks, financial institutions, processors and card issuers in the United States and abroad. We are subject to regulation because of our activities in the countries where we carry them out and because of our relationship with Popular, and at times we are also affected by the laws, rules and regulations to which our customers are subject. Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules and regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of one or more of the services we provide, and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines, all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, even an inadvertent failure by us to comply with laws, rules and regulations, as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness, could damage our reputation or brands.\nRegulation of the electronic payment card industry, including regulations applicable to us and our customers, has increased significantly in recent years. There is also continued scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the manner in which payment card networks and card issuers set various fees, from which some of our customers derive significant revenue. Further, banking regulators have been strengthening their examination guidelines with respect to relationships between banks and their third-party service providers, such as us. Any such heightened supervision of our relationship with Popular could have an effect on our contractual relationship with Popular as well as on the standards applied in the evaluation of our services. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Government Regulation and Payment Network Rules-Regulatory Reform and Other Legislative Initiatives.\u201d\nFurther changes to laws, rules and regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a negative financial effect on us.\nThe Government of Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal crisis continues. The expiration of the automatic stay on litigation to collect claims against the Government on May 1, 2017, the initiation of creditor litigation promptly thereafter and the Government\u2019s filing for bankruptcy protection on May 3, 2017, are all expected to further slow the Puerto Rico economy, increase emigration from Puerto Rico, increase the risk of non-payment of Government obligations and negatively affect the economy and consumer spending, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 81% and 79%, respectively, of our total revenues were generated from our operations in Puerto Rico. In addition, some revenues that are generated from our operations outside Puerto Rico are dependent upon our operations in Puerto Rico. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on the economic and political conditions in Puerto Rico, and could be significantly impacted by adverse economic or political developments in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico has been in economic recession since 2006. In August 2015, Puerto Rico defaulted for the first time on the Public Finance Corporation bonds. In April 2016, the Puerto Rico governor signed a debt moratorium law that gave the governor emergency powers to deal with the fiscal crisis, including the ability to declare a moratorium on any debt payment. On June 30, 2016, the U.S. President signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA). PROMESA establishes a fiscal oversight and management board (the \u201cOversight Board\u201d) comprised of seven voting members appointed by the President. PROMESA also imposed an automatic stay on all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to enforce or collect claims against the Puerto Rico government.\nOn May 1, 2017, the automatic stay imposed by PROMESA expired and creditors of the Puerto Rico government filed various lawsuits involving defaults on more than $70 billion of bonds issued by Puerto Rico. On May 3, 2017, Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy-like protection under Title III of PROMESA.\nWhile the Title III filing does not foreclose negotiations between creditors and the Puerto Rico government toward a consensual restructuring agreement, there can be no assurance that meaningful negotiations will occur or that any consensual agreement will be reached or by what date. Importantly, there also can be no assurance as to the financial outcome or timing of\nthe completion of the Title III processes. There also can be no assurance as to any favorable intervention by the U.S. Congress or the U.S. President.\nThe invocation of Title III is expected to potentially deepen Puerto Rico\u2019s economic recession, and to further curtail the ability of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities, subject to the oversight of the Oversight Board (collectively, the \u201cGovernment\u201d), to access capital markets to place new debt or roll future maturities. Additionally, potential Government actions such as further reductions in spending or the imposition of new taxes may further deepen the current economic crisis, lead to an increase in unemployment rates, and result in a continued decline in population and in the economy.\nOver the past several months, the Oversight Board released and has been working on a restructuring plan intended to reduce Puerto Rico\u2019s debt to sustainable levels and provide a path for Puerto Rico to exit the bankruptcy-like protections under PROMESA. This was an important milestone, but the most recent version of the plan is facing legal and political challenges from various sectors. The final plan will require the approval from the judge overseeing the case. At this point, it is uncertain if or when a restructuring plan will get approved or when Puerto Rico will resolve its current debt situation.\nSuch recent events could potentially adversely impact the trading price of our common stock, adversely impact our customer base, depress general consumer spending and delay the Government\u2019s payments thus increasing our Government accounts receivables, and potentially impair the collectability of those accounts receivable, all of which, individually or in the aggregate, could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had net receivables of $8.9 million from Puerto Rico and certain public corporations.\nPuerto Rico's economy, including its governmental financial crisis and the continuing effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria and other natural disasters including recent earthquakes could have a prolonged negative impact on the countries in which we operate and a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPuerto Rico\u2019s location in the Caribbean exposes the island to increased risk of hurricanes and other severe tropical weather conditions and natural disasters. Hurricanes Irma and Maria and other natural disasters including the recent earthquakes, and their aftermaths, such as the widespread power outage in Puerto Rico, the damage to infrastructure and communications networks, and the temporary cessation and slow pace of reestablishment of regular day-to-day commerce, have severely impacted the economies of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. It is unknown how long it will take for the business communities, resident populations and the economies to fully recover. Puerto Rico\u2019s current situation following Hurricane Maria could further accelerate the ongoing emigration trend of Puerto Rico residents to the United States. A prolonged delay in the repairs to the islands\u2019 infrastructures, decline in business volume and any other economic declines due to Hurricanes Irma and Maria and their aftermaths may impact demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs a result of Puerto Rico's governmental financial crisis and the impacts of natural disasters, businesses may be reluctant to establish or expand their operations in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, or might consider closing operations currently in such locations. The damage resulting from the hurricanes or other natural disasters to the operating conditions of our clients, and insufficient federal recovery and rebuilding assistance may cause lasting and severe damage to the island's economic base. The high cost of electricity, combined with Puerto Rico's high level of debt, may make Puerto Rico a less attractive place to expand existing operations or commence new business activities. In the event that companies in the financial services and related industries decide not to commence new operations or not to expand their existing operations in Puerto Rico, or consider closing operations in Puerto Rico, the demand for our services could be negatively affected.\nOur presence in international markets includes operations in several Latin American and Caribbean countries. Although we have contingency plans in effect for natural disasters or other catastrophic events, the occurrence of a natural disaster such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could still disrupt our operations outside the United States and Puerto Rico. For example, we conduct business in Chile, a country that is particularly susceptible to earthquakes. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event in the countries in which we do business could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with our presence in international markets, including political or economic instability.\nOur financial performance may be significantly affected by general economic, political and social conditions in the emerging markets where we operate. Many countries in Latin America have suffered significant economic, political and social crises in the past, and these events may occur again in the future. Instability in Latin America has been caused by many different factors, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to foreign exchange variation;\n\u2022\nsignificant governmental influence over local economies;\n\u2022\nsubstantial fluctuations in economic growth;\n\u2022\nhigh levels of inflation;\n\u2022\nexchange controls or restrictions on expatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nhigh domestic interest rates;\n\u2022\nwage and price controls;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental economic or tax policies;\n\u2022\nimposition of trade barriers;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulation which may restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war; and\n\u2022\noverall political, social and economic instability.\nAdverse economic, political and social conditions in the Latin America markets where we operate may create uncertainty regarding our operating environment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business in countries outside the United States and transactions with foreign governments increase our compliance risks and exposes us to business risks.\nOur operations outside the United States could expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other local governments or organizations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"). We have existing safeguards in place designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation and result in severe criminal or civil sanctions. In addition, we are also subject to compliance with local government regulations.\nWe are also subject to the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), which regulates the export, re-export and re-transfer abroad of covered items made or originating in the United States as well as the transfer of covered U.S.-origin technology abroad. We have adopted a compliance program to make sure our goods and technologies are exported in compliance with the requirements of the EAR. However, there can be no assurance that we have not violated the EAR in past transactions or that our new policies and procedures will prevent us from violating the EAR in every transaction in which we engage. Any such violations of the EAR could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions being imposed on us, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoreover, some financial institutions refuse, even in the absence of a regulatory requirement, to provide services to companies operating in certain countries or engaging in certain practices because of concerns that the compliance efforts perceived to be necessary may outweigh the usefulness of the service relationship. Our operations outside the United States make it more likely that financial institutions may refuse to conduct business with us for this type of reason. Any such refusal could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe and our subsidiaries conduct business with financial institutions and/or card payment networks operating in countries whose nationals, including some of our customers\u2019 customers, engage in transactions in countries that are the targets of U.S. economic sanctions and embargoes. If we are found to have failed to comply with applicable U.S. sanctions laws and regulations in these instances, we and our subsidiaries could be exposed to fines, sanctions and other penalties or other governmental investigations.\nWe and our subsidiaries conduct business with financial institutions and/or card payment networks operating in countries whose nationals, including some of our customers\u2019 customers, engage in transactions in countries that are the target of U.S. economic sanctions and embargoes, including Cuba. As a U.S.-based entity, we and our subsidiaries are obligated to comply with the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. These regulations prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments, or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes. Failure to comply with these sanctions and embargoes may result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us or other governmental investigations. In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other\ninvestors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business involving sanctioned countries or entities.\nFor these reasons, we have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. laws and regulations and have in the past voluntarily submitted disclosures to OFAC in compliance with those policies and procedures when we have identified a potential violation. Our policies and procedures include the use of software to screen transactions we process for evidence of sanctioned-country and persons involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and the difficulties of identifying all transactions of our customers\u2019 customers that may involve a sanctioned country, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable U.S. laws and regulations in every transaction in which we engage, and such violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we process transactions on behalf of financial institutions through the payment networks, we have processed a limited number of transactions potentially involving sanctioned countries and there can be no assurances that, in the future, we will not inadvertently process such transactions. Due to a variety of factors, including technical failures and limitations of our transaction screening process, conflicts between U.S. and local laws, political or other concerns in certain countries in which we and our subsidiaries operate, and/or failures in our ability to effectively control employees operating in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, we have not rejected every transaction originating from or otherwise involving sanctioned countries, or persons and there can be no assurances that, in the future, we will not inadvertently fail to reject such transactions.\nOur expansion and selective acquisition strategy exposes us to risks, including the risk that we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we evaluate opportunities for acquiring complementary businesses that may supplement our internal growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and purchase suitable operations. To the extent that we are deemed to be controlled by Popular for purposes of the BHC Act, we may conduct only activities authorized under the BHC Act and the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation K and other related regulations for a bank holding company or a financial holding company. These restrictions may limit our ability to acquire other businesses or enter into other strategic transactions. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions, we must comply with U.S. federal and other antitrust and/or competition law requirements.\nFurther, the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company, which may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s attention and our financial and other resources. Although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover all operational deficiencies or material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator. The failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our operating results.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights and defend ourselves from potential intellectual property infringement claims may diminish our competitive advantages or restrict us from delivering our services.\nOur trademarks, proprietary software, and other intellectual property, including technology/software licenses, are important to our future success. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to use such marks or a diminution in the perceived quality associated therewith could have an adverse impact on the growth of our businesses. We also rely on proprietary software and technology, including third party software that is used under licenses. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar software or technology, which would permit them to compete with us more efficiently. Furthermore, if any of the third party software or technology licenses are terminated or otherwise determined to be unenforceable, then we would have to obtain a comparable license, which may involve increased license fees and other costs.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary or confidential business know-how and other intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or misappropriate certain aspects of our services, infringe upon our rights, or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing such unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is often very difficult, and therefore, we are unable to guarantee that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary software/technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be effective or enforceable in all instances. Misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our registrations and/or applications for trademarks, copyrights, and patents could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with maximum protection or meaningful advantage. Managing any such challenges, even if they lack merit, could: (i) be expensive and time-consuming to defend; (ii) cause us to cease making, licensing or using software or applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; (iii) require us to redesign our software or applications, if feasible; (iv) divert management\u2019s attention and resources; and (v) require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Furthermore, the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States or Puerto Rico. Adverse determinations in judicial or administrative proceedings related to intellectual property or licenses could prevent us from selling our services and products, or prevent us from preventing others from selling competing services, impose liability costs on us, or result in a non-favorable settlement, all of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ability to recruit, retain and develop qualified personnel is critical to our success and growth.\nAll of our businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological, social, economic and regulatory developments that require a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital. For us to successfully compete and grow, we must retain, recruit and develop the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of our intellectual capital needs. In addition, we must develop our personnel to provide succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital. However, the market for qualified personnel is competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel in Puerto Rico is particularly challenging, given the poor state of the Puerto Rican economy and the increased emigration of Puerto Ricans following Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Our effort to retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses, which\ncould adversely affect our profitability. We cannot assure you that key personnel, including executive officers, will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFailure to comply with U.S. state and federal antitrust requirements, or the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act, and government investigations into our compliance, could adversely affect our business.\nDue to our ownership of the ATH network and our merchant acquiring and payment services business in Puerto Rico, we are involved in a significant percentage of the debit and credit card transactions conducted in Puerto Rico each day. We have in the past been subject to regulatory investigations and any future regulatory scrutiny of, or regulatory enforcement action in connection with, compliance with U.S. state and federal antitrust requirements could potentially have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nOur subsidiary, EVERTEC Group, benefits from a preferential tax exemption grant from the Puerto Rico Government under the Tax Incentive Act No. 73 of 2008 that imposes certain commitments, conditions and representations on EVERTEC Group. If EVERTEC Group does not comply with the terms of the grant, EVERTEC Group may be subject to reduction of the benefits of the grant, tax penalties, other payment obligations or full revocation of the grant, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price.\nEVERTEC Group has a tax exemption grant under the Tax Incentive Act No. 73 of 2008 from the Government of Puerto Rico. Under this grant, EVERTEC Group will benefit from a preferential income tax rate of 4% on industrial development income, as well as from tax exemptions with respect to its municipal and property tax obligations for certain activities derived from its data processing operations in Puerto Rico. The grant has a term of 15 years effective as of January 1, 2012 with respect to income tax obligations and July 1, 2013 and January 1, 2013 with respect to municipal and property tax obligations, respectively.\nThe grant contains customary commitments, conditions and representations that EVERTEC Group is required to comply with in order to maintain the grant. The more significant commitments include: (i) maintaining at least 750 employees in EVERTEC Group\u2019s Puerto Rico data processing operations during 2012 and at least 700 employees for the remaining years of the grant, (ii) investing at least $200.0 million in building, machinery, equipment or computer programs to be used in Puerto Rico during the effective term of the grant (to be made over four year capital investment cycles in $50.0 million increments), (iii) an additional best efforts capital investments requirement of $75.0 million by December 31, 2026 (to be made over four year capital investment cycles in $20.0 million the first three increments and $15.0 million the last increment); and (iv) 80% of EVERTEC Group employees must be residents of Puerto Rico. Failure to meet the requirements could result, among other things, in reductions in the benefits of the grant, tax penalties, other payment obligations or revocation of the grant in its entirety, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Structure, Governance and Stock Exchange Listing\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and pay any dividends.\nWe have no direct operations or significant assets other than the ownership of 100% of the membership interest of Holdings, which in turn has no significant assets other than ownership of 100% of the membership interest of EVERTEC Group. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, and to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in our existing senior secured credit facilities and other agreements which may govern future indebtedness of our subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. We are prohibited from paying any cash dividend on our common stock unless we satisfy certain conditions. The senior secured credit facilities also include limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. The earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans or enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock or other obligations.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), the Dodd-Frank Act, and related regulations implemented by the SEC, have substantially increased legal and financial compliance costs. We expect that our ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding the Exchange Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, will involve significant and potentially increasing costs. In particular, we must annually evaluate our internal controls systems to allow management to report on our internal controls. We must perform the system and process evaluation and testing (and any necessary remediation) required to comply with the management certification and, when applicable, auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we are not able to continue to satisfy the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may default on our credit facility and be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC. Any action of this type could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and investors\u2019 confidence in our company, and could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your common stock. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our common stock or industry;\n\u2022\nmarket perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nmarket perception of the challenges of operating a company in Puerto Rico; and\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us, our stockholders, Popular or members of our management team.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations historically and particularly in late 2018 and early 2019. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industries. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings or otherwise, including financing acquisitions. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue 206,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 72,000,261 are outstanding as of December 31, 2019. All of these shares, other than the 11,654,803 shares held by Popular and the shares held by our officers and directors, are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including any shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nThe interests of Popular may conflict with or differ from your interests as a stockholder.\nPopular has the right to nominate two members of our Board and, therefore, may be able to influence our decisions. The interests of Popular could conflict with your interests as a holder of our common stock. For example, the concentration of ownership held by Popular, the terms of the Stockholder Agreement and our organizational documents (including Popular\u2019s quorum rights and consent rights over amendments to our bylaws) and Popular\u2019s right to terminate certain of its agreements with us in certain situations upon a change of control of EVERTEC Group, could delay, defer or prevent certain significant corporate actions that you as a stockholder may otherwise view favorably, including a change of control of us (whether by merger, takeover or other business combination). See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u201d in EVERTEC\u2019s proxy statement for a description of the circumstances under which Popular may terminate certain of its agreements with us. A sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Popular could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur organizational documents and Stockholder Agreement may impede or discourage a takeover, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and the Stockholder Agreement may make it more difficult for, or prevent a third party from, acquiring control of us without the approval of our Board and/or Popular. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na voting agreement pursuant to which Popular agreed to vote its shares in favor of the Popular director nominees (which, constitute the right to appoint two of our nine directors), directors nominated by a committee of our Board in accordance with the Stockholder Agreement and the management director and to remove and replace any such directors in accordance with the terms of the Stockholder Agreement and applicable law and an agreement by us to take all actions within our control necessary and desirable to cause the election, removal and replacement of such directors in accordance with the Stockholder Agreement and applicable law;\n\u2022\nrequiring that a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board (other than a reconvened meeting with the same agenda as the originally adjourned meeting) consist of (1) a majority of the total number of directors then serving on the Board and (2) at least one director nominated by Popular, for so long as it owns, together with its affiliates, 5% or more of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders other than Popular (as further described below);\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent unless the action is taken by unanimous written consent;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings, which advance notice requirements are not applicable to any directors nominated in accordance with the terms of the Stockholder Agreement.\nOur issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change in control of us. Our Board has authority to issue shares of preferred stock, subject to the approval of at least one director nominated by Popular for so long as Popular, together with its respective affiliates, owns at least 10% of our outstanding common stock. Our Board may issue preferred stock in one or more series, designate the number of shares constituting any series, and fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. In addition, Popular, under and subject to the Stockholder Agreement and our organizational documents, will retain significant influence over matters requiring board or stockholder approval, including the election of directors. Together, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Stockholder Agreement could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock. Furthermore, the existence of the foregoing provisions, as well as the significant common stock owned by Popular and its individual right to nominate a specified number of directors in certain circumstances, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of us, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nDespite our high indebtedness level, we and our subsidiaries still may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured. Although the agreement setting forth the terms of our senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition to the $116.9 million which was available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2019, the terms of the senior secured credit facilities enable us to increase the amount available under the term loan and/or revolving credit facilities if we are able to obtain loan commitments from banks and satisfy certain other conditions. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the related risks that we face would increase.\nIf we are unable to comply with covenants in our debt instruments that limit our flexibility in operating our business, or obligate us to take action such as deliver financial reports, we may default under our debt instruments and our indebtedness may become due.\nThe agreement setting forth the terms of the senior secured credit facilities contain, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\ngrant liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. In addition, the covenants in the senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain a maximum total secured net leverage ratio and also limit our capital expenditures. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross default provisions and, in the case of our revolving credit facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such actions by those lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the senior secured credit facilities. If the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, the proceeds from the sale or foreclosure upon such assets will first be used to repay debt under our senior secured credit facilities and we may not have sufficient assets to repay our unsecured indebtedness thereafter. As a result, our common stock could become worthless.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nThe risks referenced above are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDiscontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, or uncertainty related to the potential for any of the foregoing, may adversely affect our business.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may negatively impact the volatility of LIBOR rates, liquidity, our access to funding required to operate our business, our ability to hedge our interest rate risk, or the trading market for our existing senior secured credit facilities.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $530.8 million of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bearing interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. Together with the administrative agent for those facilities, we may replace LIBOR with a comparable or successor rate in a manner that gives due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities. The replacement of LIBOR with a comparable or successor rate could\ncause the amount of interest payable on our senior secured credit facilities to be materially different than expected. We may choose in the future to pursue amendments to our senior secured credit facilities to provide for a comparable or successor rate, but we can give no assurance that we will be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments.\nAt December 31, 2019, we also had two interest rate swap agreements which are designed to protect us from changes in interest rates. If LIBOR becomes unavailable and market quotations for specified inter-bank lending are not available, it is unclear how payments under such agreements would be calculated, which could cause these agreements to no longer offer us the protection we expect. Relevant industry groups are seeking to create a standard protocol addressing the expected discontinuation of LIBOR, to which parties to then-existing swaps will be able to adhere. There can be no assurance that such a protocol will be developed or that our swap counterparties will adhere to it. It is uncertain whether amending our then-existing swap agreements may provide us with effective protection from changes in the then-applicable interest rate on our senior secured credit facility indebtedness or other indebtedness. Similarly, while industry groups have announced that they anticipate amending standard documentation to facilitate a market in swaps on one or more successor rates to LIBOR, it is uncertain whether and to what extent a market for interest rate swaps on the successor rate selected for our senior secured credit facility indebtedness or other indebtedness will develop, which may affect our ability to effectively hedge our interest rate exposure.", "PERMNO": 13837, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "EVTC"}
