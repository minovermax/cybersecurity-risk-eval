RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below are not the only ones we face in our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE ECONOMY AND OTHER EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING REGULATION\nClimate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our operations, businesses and customers.\nThere is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding and wildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Such events could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely, including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. Additionally, transitioning to a low-carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market initiatives. Transition risks, including changes in consumer preferences and additional regulatory requirements or taxes, could increase our expenses and undermine our strategies. In addition, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change, including our involvement, or our clients\u2019 involvement, in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. As climate risk is interconnected with many key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management strategies established for risks such as market, credit and operational risks; however, because the timing and severity of climate change may not be predictable, our risk management strategies may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting THE OPERATIONS OF us and our customers.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 and the potential for further variants to develop has created a global public-health crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility and deteriorations in household, business, economic, and market conditions. This pandemic has caused many state governments to enact social distancing requirements, which have adversely impacted the economy due to the vast restrictions and forced closures of non-essential businesses during the quarantine periods. As a result, many of our customers have been adversely affected by business closures, staffing issues and/or other business restrictions. Accordingly, COVID-19 may result in a significant decrease in our customer\u2019 business and/or cause our customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us. These adverse impacts on the businesses of our customers could cause a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN WESBANCO\u2019S MARKET AREAS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT EARNINGS.\nWesbanco Bank serves both individuals and business customers primarily throughout West Virginia, Ohio, western Pennsylvania, Kentucky, southern Indiana and Maryland. The substantial majority of Wesbanco\u2019s loan portfolio is to individuals and businesses in these markets. As a result, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Wesbanco are affected by local and regional economic conditions, as well as national economic conditions. A downturn in these economies could have a negative impact on Wesbanco and the ability of the Bank\u2019s customers to repay their loans. The value of the collateral securing loans to borrowers may also decline as the economy declines. As a result, deteriorating economic conditions in these markets could cause a decline in the overall quality of Wesbanco\u2019s loan portfolio requiring Wesbanco to charge-off a higher percentage of loans and/or increase its allowance for credit losses. A decline in economic conditions in these markets may also force customers to utilize deposits held by Wesbanco Bank in order to pay current expenses causing the Bank\u2019s deposit base to shrink. As a result, the Bank may have to borrow funds at higher rates in order to meet liquidity needs. Volatility in oil and gas prices has reduced shale gas activity in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which has somewhat negatively impacted local and regional economic conditions, affecting both commercial and retail customers, resulting in lower oil and gas related royalty deposits and potential credit deterioration in the loan portfolio.\nMARKET VOLATILITY AND PROLONGED PERIODS OF ECONOMIC STRESS MAY AFFECT WESBANCO\u2019S CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused volatility in financial markets and could potentially cause prolonged periods of economic stress. This may result in decreased capital and liquidity. In addition to the potential affects from negative economic conditions noted above, Wesbanco instituted a program to help COVID-19 impacted customers in 2020. This program allowed for up to a 180 day deferral of loan principal and/or interest payments as long as the customer met certain requirements. If these deferrals are not effective in mitigating the effect of COVID-19 on our customers, it may adversely affect our business and results of operations more substantially over a longer period of time as additional deferrals may need to be granted on a case-by-case basis. Although the economy has recovered during 2021, if the economic situation would further\ndeteriorate, federal and state regulators may consider taking actions such as suspension of dividends and other capital distributions in order to conserve banking industry capital and retain lending capacity, which could adversely impact our business.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition and results of operation, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios depends on future pandemic-related developments, which are somewhat uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and the efficacy of actions taken to date by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nWESBANCO COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES TO THE FISCAL, POLITICAL AND OTHER FEDERAL POLICIES.\nChanges in general economic or political policies in the United States or other regions could adversely impact Wesbanco\u2019s business as well as the Bank\u2019s customers. The current United States administration has indicated that it may propose significant changes with respect to a variety of issues, including international trade agreements, import and export regulations, tariffs and customs duties, foreign relations, tax laws, corporate governance laws and corporate fuel economy standards, that could have a positive or negative impact on Wesbanco\u2019s business and the Bank\u2019s customers including those in the wholesale and distribution, manufacturing and retail industries.\nWESBANCO IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION.\nWesbanco is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, rather than corporate shareholders. These regulations affect Wesbanco\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, operations and growth, among other things. These regulations also impose obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedure and controls. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect Wesbanco in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject Wesbanco to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products that could be offered, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on Wesbanco\u2019s business, financial condition and result of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Wesbanco had $132.9 million in junior subordinated debt presented as a separate category of long-term debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. For regulatory purposes, Trust Preferred Securities totaling $130.0 million underlying such junior subordinated debt were previously included in Tier 1 capital in accordance with regulatory reporting requirements prior to December 31, 2019. Rules issued in 2013 generally exclude trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital beginning in 2015. A grandfather provision permitted bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $15 billion to continue counting existing trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital until maturity. As of December 31, 2019, Wesbanco\u2019s assets were greater than $15 billion; therefore, all such securities are no longer counted as Tier 1 capital but instead are counted as Tier 2 capital subject to limits.\nIn addition, international capital standards known as Basel III, which were implemented by a U.S. federal banking agencies\u2019 joint final rule issued in July 2013, and effective January 1, 2015, further increase the minimum capital requirements applicable to Wesbanco and the Bank, which may negatively impact both entities. Additional information about these changes in capital requirements are described above in \u201cItem 1. Business-Capital Requirements.\u201d\nRegulation of Wesbanco and its subsidiaries is expected to continue to expand in scope and complexity in the future. These laws are expected to have the effect of increasing Wesbanco\u2019s costs of operating and reducing its revenues, and may limit its ability to pursue business opportunities or otherwise adversely affect its business and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Act and other laws, as well as rules implementing or related to them, may adversely affect Wesbanco. Specifically, any governmental or regulatory action having the effect of requiring Wesbanco to obtain additional capital or increase short-term liquidity could reduce earnings and have a material dilutive effect on current shareholders, including the Dodd-Frank Act source of strength requirement that bank holding companies make capital infusions into a troubled subsidiary bank. Legislation and regulation of debit card fees, credit cards and other bank services, as well as changes in Wesbanco\u2019s practices relating to those and other bank services, may affect Wesbanco\u2019s revenue and other financial results. Additional information about increased regulation is provided in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d under the headings \u201cSupervision and Regulation,\u201d \u201cHolding Company Regulations,\u201d \u201cCapital Requirements,\u201d \u201cDodd-Frank Act,\u201d and \u201cConsumer Protection Laws.\u201d\nSEVERE WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS, DISEASE PANDEMICS, ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM, AND OTHER EXTERNAL EVENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY IMPACT WESBANCO\u2019S BUSINESS.\nThe unpredictable nature of events such as severe weather, natural disasters, disease pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on Wesbanco\u2019s ability to conduct business. If any of our financial, accounting, network or other\ninformation processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings due to external events, Wesbanco could be materially adversely affected. Third parties with which Wesbanco does business could also be sources of operational risk to Wesbanco, including the risk that the third parties\u2019 own network and information processing systems could fail. Any of these occurrences could materially diminish Wesbanco\u2019s ability to operate or result in potential liability to customers, reputational damage, and regulatory intervention, any of which could materially adversely affect Wesbanco. Such events could affect the stability of Wesbanco\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, impair Wesbanco\u2019s liquidity, result in loss of revenue, and/or cause Wesbanco to incur additional expenses.\nTHE SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT WESBANCO.\nFinancial service institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. Wesbanco has exposure to various industries and counterparties, and Wesbanco routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutions. As a result, a default by, or potential default by, a financial institution could result in market-wide liquidity problems, losses or other financial institution defaults. Many of these transactions could expose Wesbanco to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. These losses or defaults could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCURRENT MARKET INTEREST RATES AND COST OF FUNDS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT WESBANCO\u2019S BANKING BUSINESS.\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact the business of the Bank. The Bank\u2019s main source of income from operations is net interest income, which is equal to the difference between the interest income received on interest-bearing assets (usually loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings). These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond Wesbanco\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. Wesbanco Bank\u2019s net interest income can be affected significantly by changes in market interest rates and the shape of the yield curve. Changes in relative interest rates may reduce the Bank\u2019s net interest income as the difference between interest income and interest expense decreases, as it did in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and has resulted in a number of Federal Reserve actions. Market interest rates have declined significantly beginning in 2020 and these rates have stayed at these lower levels through 2021. We expect that these reductions in interest rates will continue to adversely affect our net interest income, margins and our profitability, although federal funds and market rate increases are expected to occur in 2022 and future periods. The Bank has adopted asset and liability management policies to minimize the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income, primarily by altering the mix and maturity of loans, investments and funding sources. However, even with these policies in place and with an asset-sensitive balance sheet at year-end that should benefit net interest income as interest rates increase, Wesbanco cannot be certain that changes in interest rates or the shape of the interest rate yield curve will not negatively impact its results of operations or financial position.\nIn the current low rate and relatively flat yield curve environment and with Wesbanco\u2019s cost of funds for banking operations at very low levels, future loan and investment yield decreases may not be offset by further cost of funds decreases. Cost of funds may alternatively increase as a result of future general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures. The Bank has traditionally obtained funds principally through deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), correspondent banks, and other wholesale borrowing sources. As a general matter, deposits are a cheaper source of funds than borrowings because interest rates paid for deposits are typically less than interest rates charged for borrowings. If, as a result of general economic conditions, market interest rates, competitive pressures or otherwise, the value of deposits at the Bank decreases relative to its overall banking operations, the Bank may have to rely more heavily on borrowings as a source of funds in the future.\nINTEREST RATES ON WESBANCO\u2019S OUTSTANDING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BASED ON REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS.\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and certain other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to become unavailable, to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences, which cannot be predicted. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intended to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The Federal Reserve Board has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the preferred reference rate alternative to LIBOR for loan pricing and hedge accounting purposes. If LIBOR ceases to exist, if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason or if the proposed replacement rate for LIBOR differs materially from LIBOR, interest rates on our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. Further, any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates. On March 5, 2021, the U.K. FCA and Intercontinental Exchange (\u201cICE\u201d) Benchmark Administration announced that the publication of the overnight, as well as, the one, three, six, and twelve month LIBOR rates will continue to be published through June 30, 2023. On October 20, 2021, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation along with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, National Credit Union Administration, and State Bank and Credit Union Regulators, issued an additional Joint Statement on Managing the LIBOR Transition to once again emphasize the expectation that supervised institutions with LIBOR exposure continue to progress toward an orderly transition away from LIBOR. The statement confirmed that entering into new contracts, including derivatives that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021, would create safety and soundness risks, including litigation, operational, and consumer protection risks.\nSIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN U.S. AND GLOBAL MARKETS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WESBANCO\u2019S EARNINGS.\nThe capital and credit markets could experience extreme disruption. These conditions result in less liquidity, greater volatility, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain asset types. In many cases, markets could exert downward pressure on stock prices, security prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. Sustained weakness in business and economic conditions in any or all of the domestic or foreign financial markets could result in credit deterioration in investment securities held by us, rating agency downgrades for such securities or other market factors that (such as lack of liquidity for re-sales, absence of reliable pricing information or unanticipated changes in the competitive market) could result in us having to recognize other-than-temporary impairment in the value of such investment securities, with a corresponding charge against earnings. Furthermore, our pension assets are primarily invested in equity and debt securities, and weakness in capital and credit markets could result in deterioration of these assets, and changes in certain key pension assumptions based on current interest rates, long-term rates of return and other economic or actuarial assumptions may increase minimum funding contributions and future pension expense. If these markets were to deteriorate further, these conditions may be material to Wesbanco\u2019s ability to access capital and may adversely impact results of operations.\nFurther, Wesbanco\u2019s trust and investment services income could be impacted by fluctuations in the securities market. A portion of this revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios. If the values of those investment portfolios decline, the Bank\u2019s revenue could be negatively impacted.\nInflation can also have a significant effect upon interest rates and ultimately upon financial performance. Wesbanco\u2019s ability to cope with inflation and to respond to changing market interest rates, as well as its ability to manage the various elements of non-interest income and expense during periods of increasing or decreasing inflation could have a significant impact on profitability. Wesbanco monitors the level and mix of interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities through its Asset/Liability Committee (\"ALCO\") in order to reduce the impact of inflation on net interest income. Management may not be able to control the effects of inflation as needed and the results may adversely impact results of operations.\nA HIGH PERCENTAGE OF WESBANCO\u2019S LOAN PORTFOLIO IS IN WEST VIRGINIA, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, KENTUCKY, INDIANA AND MARYLAND AND IN COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE. DETERIORATIONS IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THIS AREA OR IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET GENERALLY COULD BE MORE HARMFUL TO THE COMPANY COMPARED TO MORE DIVERSIFIED INSTITUTIONS.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 18% of Wesbanco\u2019s loan portfolio was comprised of residential real estate loans, and 57% was comprised of commercial real estate loans.\nInherent risks of commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) lending include the cyclical nature of the real estate market, construction risk and interest rate risk. The cyclical nature of real estate markets can cause CRE loans to suffer considerable distress. During these times of distress, a property\u2019s performance can be negatively affected by tenants\u2019 deteriorating credit strength and lease expirations in times of softening demand caused by\neconomic deterioration or over-supply conditions. Even if borrowers are able to meet their payment obligations, they may find it difficult to refinance their full loan amounts at maturity due to declines in property value. Other risks associated with CRE lending include regulatory changes and environmental liability. Regulatory changes in tax legislation, zoning or similar external conditions including environmental liability may affect property values and the economic feasibility of existing and proposed real estate projects.\nThe Company\u2019s CRE loan portfolio is concentrated in West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Indiana and Maryland. There is a wide variety of economic conditions within the local markets of the six states in which most of the company\u2019s CRE loan portfolio is situated. Rates of employment, consumer loan demand, household formation, and the level of economic activity can vary widely from state to state and among metropolitan areas, cities and towns. Metropolitan markets comprise various submarkets where property values and demand can be affected by many factors, such as demographic makeup, geographic features, transportation, recreation, local government, school systems, utility infrastructure, tax burden, building-stock age, zoning and building codes, and available land for development. As a result of the high concentration of the company\u2019s loan portfolio, it may be more sensitive, as compared to more diversified institutions, to future disruptions in and deterioration of this market, which could lead to losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the company. Furthermore, approximately 13% of Wesbanco\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio is comprised of hotel loans. In the current pandemic environment, these borrowers have been impacted from low occupancy rates and consumers\u2019 and businesses' general reluctance to travel. There is a risk that loan modifications made under the CARES Act may not be sufficient for certain loans in order to recover the full principal balance.\nRISKS INHERENT IN MUNICIPAL BONDS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WESBANCO\u2019S EARNINGS.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 25% of Wesbanco\u2019s total securities portfolio was invested in municipal bonds. Although Wesbanco\u2019s municipal portfolio is broadly spread across the U.S., any downturn in the economy of a state or municipality in which Wesbanco holds municipal obligations could increase the default risk of the respective debt. In addition, a portion of Wesbanco\u2019s municipal portfolio is comprised of Build America bonds. Due to the government sequester reducing the interest subsidy that the government provides to the issuing municipalities, extraordinary redemption provisions (\"ERP\") may be executed by the municipality if it is in their favor to do so. There is a risk that when an ERP is executed, Wesbanco may not recover its amortized cost in the bond if it was purchased at a premium. Credit risks are also prevalent when downgrades of credit ratings are issued by major credit rating agencies, which are caused by creditworthiness issues of both bond insurers and the municipality itself. Credit rating downgrades to a non-investment grade level may force Wesbanco to sell a municipal bond at a price where amortized cost may not be recovered. Rising interest rates could also cause the current market values of our municipal bond portfolio to decline as they all have a fixed interest component. Any of the above default risks, early redemption risks and credit risks could cause Wesbanco to take impairment charges, which could be significant, that would negatively impact earnings.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE BUSINESS OF BANKING\nCUSTOMERS MAY DEFAULT ON THE REPAYMENT OF LOANS, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THROUGH INCREASES IN THE PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.\nThe Bank\u2019s customers may default on the repayment of loans, which may negatively impact Wesbanco\u2019s earnings due to loss of principal and interest income. Increased operating expenses may result from the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work-out of the loan. Collection efforts may or may not be successful causing Wesbanco to write off the loan or repossess the collateral securing the loan, which may or may not exceed the balance of the loan.\nHIGHER FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND ASSESSMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT WESBANCO\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nSince crossing over $10 billion in total assets in 2018, Wesbanco Bank\u2019s FDIC insurance premiums have increased due to a higher assessment rate based on a more complex calculation that includes Wesbanco Bank\u2019s CAMELS ratings, its ability to withstand asset-related and funding-related stress and potential loss severity of its assets. If premium assessment rates were to further increase, it would negatively impact Wesbanco\u2019s earnings.\nRISKS RELATED TO ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nTHE CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (\u201cCECL\u201d) ACCOUNTING STANDARD COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY OF THE ESTIMATION OF CREDIT LOSSES AND MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIn September 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued an accounting standard update, ASU 2016-13 (Topic 326), \u201cMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which was adopted by Wesbanco as of January 1, 2020 and replaced the former \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the CECL model. Under the CECL model, we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at\nthe net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses under CECL is calculated utilizing the PD / LGD, which is then discounted to net present value. PD is the probability the asset will default within a given time frame and LGD is the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected due to default. The primary macroeconomic drivers of the quantitative model include forecasts of national unemployment and interest rates, as well as modeling adjustments for changes in prepayment speeds, loan risk grades, portfolio mix, concentrations and loan growth. Any changes in the model inputs may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for credit losses. Any material increase in our level of allowance for credit losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWesbanco\u2019s regulatory agencies (FDIC and WVDIF for Wesbanco Bank, Inc. and the Federal Reserve for Wesbanco, Inc.) periodically review the allowance for credit losses. The regulatory agencies\u2019 interpretations may differ from Wesbanco\u2019s interpretations. These differences could negatively impact Wesbanco\u2019s results of operations or financial position.\nWESBANCO MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CAUSING ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS TO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.\nWhen Wesbanco acquires a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. Wesbanco\u2019s goodwill was approximately $1.1 billion or 41% of stockholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Under current accounting standards, if Wesbanco determines that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, it is required to write down the carrying value of these assets. Wesbanco conducts an annual review to determine whether goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are impaired. Wesbanco completed such an impairment analysis in late 2021 and concluded that no impairment charge was necessary for the year ended December 31, 2021. Wesbanco cannot provide assurance that it will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on its shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results and may cause a decline in our stock price.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nDUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION, WESBANCO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN BANKING CUSTOMERS AT CURRENT LEVELS.\nWesbanco operates in a highly competitive banking and financial industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes. Wesbanco faces banking competition in all the markets it serves from the following:\n\u2022local, regional and national banks;\n\u2022savings and loans;\n\u2022internet banks;\n\u2022credit unions;\n\u2022payday lenders and money services businesses;\n\u2022finance companies;\n\u2022online trading and robo-advisors;\n\u2022financial technology companies and other non-bank lenders; and\n\u2022brokerage firms serving Wesbanco\u2019s market areas.\nIn particular, Wesbanco\u2019s competitors include several major national financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions may have products and services not offered by Wesbanco such as new payment system technologies and cryptocurrency, which may cause current and potential customers to choose those institutions. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain deposits and range and quality of services provided. Competitively priced deposits from other banks may cause a loss of deposits to be replaced by more expensive wholesale funding. Wesbanco also faces competition from financial technology (\u201cFinTech\u201d) companies, who may more efficiently underwrite and close small business and consumer loans as well as more quickly and efficiently open deposit accounts. In addition to providing products and services traditionally offered by banks, some FinTech companies allow customers to complete financial transactions without the need for bank intermediaries. This could result in the loss of revenue from transaction fees and fewer customer accounts. If Wesbanco is unable to attract new and retain current customers, loan and deposit growth could decrease, causing Wesbanco\u2019s results of operations and financial condition to be negatively impacted.\nWESBANCO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXPAND ITS TRUST AND INVESTMENT SERVICES SEGMENT AND RETAIN ITS CURRENT CUSTOMERS.\nWesbanco may not be able to attract new and retain current investment management clients due to competition from the following:\n\u2022commercial banks and trust companies;\n\u2022mutual fund companies;\n\u2022investment advisory firms;\n\u2022law firms;\n\u2022brokerage firms; and\n\u2022other financial services companies.\nIts ability to successfully attract and retain investment management clients is dependent upon its ability to compete with competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. Due to changes in economic conditions, the performance of the trust and investment services segment may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in which investment clients\u2019 assets are invested, causing clients to seek other alternative investment options. If Wesbanco is not successful, its results from operations and financial position may be negatively impacted.\nFUTURE EXPANSION BY WESBANCO MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS WELL AS DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nWesbanco may acquire other financial institutions, or branches or assets of other financial institutions, in the future. Wesbanco may also open new branches and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services. Any such expansion of our business will involve a number of expenses and risks, which may include:\n\u2022the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential expansions;\n\u2022the potential inaccuracy of estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risk with respect to target institutions;\n\u2022the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring local management and opening new offices, and the delay between commencing these activities and the generation of profits from the expansion;\n\u2022the risk we could discover undisclosed liabilities resulting from any acquisitions for which we may become responsible;\n\u2022our financing of the expansion;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;\n\u2022entry into unfamiliar markets;\n\u2022the introduction of new products and services into our existing business;\n\u2022the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022the risk that benefits such as enhanced earnings that we anticipate from any new acquisitions may not develop and future results of the combined companies may be materially lower from those estimated; and\n\u2022the risk of loss of key employees and customers.\nWe can give no assurance that integration efforts for any future acquisitions will be successful. Our inability to successfully integrate future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we may issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions, which could dilute the economic and voting interests of our existing shareholders.\nNo assurance can be given that Wesbanco will be successful overcoming the risks as disclosed above. The risks associated with entering into a new market and any inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSUITABLE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO WESBANCO IN THE FUTURE.\nWesbanco continually evaluates opportunities to acquire other businesses. However, Wesbanco may not have the opportunity to make suitable acquisitions on favorable terms in the future, which could negatively impact the growth of its business. Wesbanco expects that other banking and financial companies, many of which have significantly greater resources, will compete to acquire compatible businesses. This competition could increase prices for acquisitions that Wesbanco would likely pursue, and its competitors may have greater resources than it does. Also, acquisitions of regulated businesses such as banks are subject to various regulatory approvals. If Wesbanco fails to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, it will not be able to consummate an acquisition that it believes is in its best interests.\nWESBANCO IS EXPOSED TO OPERATIONAL RISK THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY.\nWesbanco is exposed to multiple types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, clerical or record-keeping errors and computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions. Wesbanco\u2019s business is dependent on the ability to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. Wesbanco could be materially and adversely affected if employees, clients, counterparties or other third parties caused an operational breakdown or failure, as a result of either human error, fraudulent manipulation or purposeful damage to any of our operations or systems.\nLOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES COULD IMPACT GROWTH AND EARNINGS AND MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON BUSINESS.\nOur operating results and ability to adequately manage our growth are highly dependent on the services, managerial abilities and performance of our key employees, including executive officers and senior management. Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of management personnel. The loss of services, or the inability to successfully complete planned or unplanned transitions of key personnel approaching normal retirement age, could have an adverse impact on Wesbanco\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition because of their skills, knowledge of the local markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. In addition, the transition to increased work-from-home (remote or hybrid work environments) brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, may exacerbate the challenges of attracting and retaining talented and diverse employees as job markets may be less constrained by physical geography. Filling open positions is also challenging in this environment and may adversely impact our business segments.\nLIMITED AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS AND LIQUIDITY FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM AND OTHER SOURCES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT EARNINGS.\nWesbanco Bank is currently a member bank of the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) of Pittsburgh. Membership in this system of quasi-governmental, regional home-loan oriented agency banks allows us to participate in various programs offered by the FHLB. We borrow funds from the FHLB, which are secured by a blanket lien on certain residential and commercial mortgage loans, and if applicable, investment securities with collateral values in excess of the outstanding balances. Future earnings shortfalls and minimum capital requirements of the FHLB may impact the collateral necessary to secure borrowings and limit the borrowings extended to their member banks, as well as require additional capital contributions by member banks. The FHLB\u2019s rating assigned to Wesbanco Bank may also negatively impact the amount of term collateral and other conditions imposed by the FHLB upon Wesbanco Bank. Should these situations occur, Wesbanco\u2019s short-term liquidity needs could be negatively impacted. If Wesbanco was restricted from using FHLB advances due to weakness in the system or with the FHLB of Pittsburgh, Wesbanco may be forced to find alternative funding sources. If Wesbanco is required to rely more heavily on higher cost funding sources, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover these costs, which would adversely affect Wesbanco\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nWESBANCO\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPEND ON THE SUCCESSFUL GROWTH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES.\nWesbanco\u2019s primary business activity for the foreseeable future will be to act as the holding company of its banking and other subsidiaries. Therefore, Wesbanco\u2019s future profitability will depend on the success and growth of these subsidiaries. In the future, part of Wesbanco\u2019s growth may come from buying other banks and buying or establishing other companies. Such entities may not be profitable after they are purchased or established, and they may lose money or be dilutive to earnings per share, particularly for the first few years. A new bank or company may bring with it unexpected liabilities, bad loans, or poor employee relations, or the new bank or company may lose customers and the associated revenue. Dilution of book and tangible book value may occur as a result of an acquisition that may not be earned back for several years, if at all.\nWESBANCO MAY NEED TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE, BUT CAPITAL MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR AT ACCEPTABLE TERMS.\nFederal and state banking regulators require Wesbanco and its banking subsidiary, Wesbanco Bank, to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. In addition, in the future Wesbanco may need to raise additional capital to support its business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or Wesbanco may otherwise elect to raise additional capital in anticipation of future growth opportunities. Since Wesbanco\u2019s total assets increased above $15 billion due to recent acquisitions, certain trust preferred securities are no longer included in the Tier 1 capital of the risk-based capital guidelines; however, they are counted as Tier 2 capital.\nAlthough Wesbanco successfully raised $150 million of Series A preferred stock in 2020, Wesbanco\u2019s ability to raise additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital for parent company or banking subsidiary needs will depend on conditions and interest rates at that time in the capital markets, overall economic conditions, Wesbanco\u2019s financial performance and condition, and other factors, many of which are outside our control. There is no assurance that, if needed, Wesbanco will be able to raise additional equity or secured /unsecured debt that may count as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital on favorable terms or at all. An inability to raise additional capital may have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand operations, and on our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWESBANCO\u2019S ABILITY TO MITIGATE RISK DEPENDS ON OUR ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK.\nWesbanco has implemented a risk appetite statement and an enterprise risk management framework to identify and manage our risk exposures while maintaining a safe and sound banking organization. This framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, legal and compliance, liquidity, market, operational, reputational and strategic risks. Included in this framework are three independent lines of defense, which allows Wesbanco to effectively govern and manage risk. If our risk management framework is not effective, Wesbanco could be exposed to unexpected losses and become subject to regulatory consequences, as a result of which our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY\nINTERRUPTION TO OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS OR BREACHES IN SECURITY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT WESBANCO\u2019S OPERATIONS.\nWesbanco relies on information systems and communications for operating and monitoring all major aspects of business, as well as internal management functions. Any failure, interruption, intrusion or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Wesbanco customer relationship, management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While Wesbanco has policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to prevent or limit the effect of any failure, interruption, intrusion or security breach of its information systems, and also performs testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans, there can be no absolute assurance that the above-noted issues will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.\nThere have been efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at various financial institutions. The ability of our customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches. Because the techniques used to attack financial services company communications and information systems change frequently (and generally increase in sophistication), often attacks are not recognized until launched against a target, may be supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to address these techniques in advance of attacks, including by implementing adequate preventative measures. Certain financial institutions in the United States have also experienced attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties that were intended to disrupt normal business activities by making internet banking systems inaccessible to customers for extended periods. These \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d attacks, if attempted, would require substantial resources to defend, and may affect customer satisfaction and behavior. Moreover, the development and maintenance of preventative and detective measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated.\nCyber-attacks on third party retailers or other business establishments that widely accept debit card or check payments could compromise sensitive bank customer information, such as debit card and account numbers. Such an attack could result in significant costs to the bank, such as costs to reimburse customers, reissue debit cards and open new customer accounts.\nThe occurrence of any such failure, disruption or security breach of Wesbanco\u2019s information systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to our customers, could damage Wesbanco\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject Wesbanco to additional regulatory scrutiny, and expose Wesbanco to civil litigation and possible financial liability. In addition, the prevalence of cyber-attacks and other efforts to breach or disrupt our systems has led, and will continue to lead, to costs to Wesbanco with respect to prevention and mitigation of these risks, as well as costs reimbursing customers for losses suffered as a result of these actions. Successful attacks or systems failures at other large\nfinancial institutions, whether or not Wesbanco is included, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions with a potential negative impact on Wesbanco\u2019s business, additional demands on the part of our regulators, and increased costs to deal with risks identified as a result of the problems affecting others. The risks described above could have a material effect on Wesbanco\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWESBANCO DEPENDS ON THIRD PARTIES FOR PROCESSING AND HANDLING OF COMPANY RECORDS AND DATA.\nWesbanco relies on software developed by third party vendors to process various transactions. These transactions include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits, trust record keeping, loan and deposit processing, merchant processing, and securities portfolio management. While Wesbanco performs a review of controls instituted by the vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and performs its own testing of user controls, Wesbanco must rely on the continued maintenance and improvement of these controls by the third party, including safeguards over the security of customer data. In addition, Wesbanco maintains backups of key processing output daily in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems. Nonetheless, Wesbanco may incur a temporary disruption in its ability to conduct its business or process its transactions or incur damage to its reputation if the third party vendor, or the third party vendor\u2019s subcontractor, fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. Such disruption or breach of security may have a material adverse effect on Wesbanco\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFAILURE TO KEEP PACE WITH TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT WESBANCO\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Wesbanco\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in Wesbanco\u2019s operations, which was done in 2021 as Wesbanco completed its core banking software conversion. The adoption of new technologies by competitors, including internet banking services, mobile applications, advanced ATM functionality and cryptocurrencies could require Wesbanco to make additional substantial investments to modify or adapt the existing products and services or even radically alter the way Wesbanco conducts business. These and other capital investments in the Company's business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. Wesbanco also may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect Wesbanco\u2019s growth, revenue, and profit.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RISKS\nWESBANCO HAS OUTSTANDING SECURITIES SENIOR TO OUR COMMON STOCK WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON THE COMMON STOCK.\nWesbanco has outstanding Series A Preferred Stock that is senior to our common stock and could adversely affect our ability to declare or pay dividends or distributions on our common stock. The terms of the preferred stock offering prohibits us from declaring or paying dividends or making distributions on our common stock unless the full dividends for the most recently completed dividend period have been declared and paid, or set aside for payment, on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Whenever dividends on any shares of Series A Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (a \u201cNonpayment Event\u201d), the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of voting preferred stock then outstanding would be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of our board of directors (the \u201cPreferred Stock Directors\u201d), provided that our board of directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors and that the election of any Preferred Stock Directors shall not cause us to violate the corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market (or any other exchange on which our securities may be listed) including the requirements that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. In the event that the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and other holders of voting preferred stock are entitled to vote for the election of the Preferred Stock Directors following a Nonpayment Event, the number of directors on our board of directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series A Preferred Stock or of any other series of voting preferred stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the shareholders, in which event such election shall be held only at such next annual or special meeting of shareholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any such series of voting preferred stock for at least four consecutive dividend periods following the Nonpayment Event shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for payment).\nWESBANCO\u2019S ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS IS LIMITED, AND COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS MAY HAVE TO BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED.\nSubject to restrictions described in the previous risk factor, holders of shares of Wesbanco\u2019s common stock are entitled to dividends if, when, and as declared by Wesbanco\u2019s Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. Although the Board of Directors has declared and increased shareholder dividends in the past, the current ability to pay such dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the Bank. Federal and state laws impose restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, which restrictions are more fully described in \u201cItem 1. Business-Payment of Dividends.\u201d In general, future dividend policy is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including Wesbanco\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s future earnings, liquidity and capital requirements, regulatory constraints and financial condition.\nVolatility in the price and volume of our stock may be unfavorable.\nThe market price of our common stock can be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Some of these factors include, without limitation:\n\u2022prevailing market conditions;\n\u2022our financial and operating results;\n\u2022estimates of our business potential and earnings prospects;\n\u2022an overall assessment of our management;\n\u2022changes in interest rates;\n\u2022business interruptions, such as may result from natural disasters, health concerns such as the coronavirus or other events;\n\u2022our performance relative to our peers;\n\u2022market demand for our shares;\n\u2022perceptions of the banking industry in general;\n\u2022political influences on investor sentiment; and\n\u2022consumer confidence.\nAt times, the stock markets, including the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which our common stock is listed, may experience significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\nIn addition, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.", "PERMNO": 11293, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WSBC"}
